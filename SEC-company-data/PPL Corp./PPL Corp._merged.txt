quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk-sensitive instruments ppl actively manages the market risk inherent in its commodity, debt, and foreign currency and equity positions, as detailed in notes 9 and 19 to the financial statements. ppl has a comprehensive risk management policy to manage the risk exposures related to counterparty credit, energy prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. a rmc comprised of senior officers oversees the risk management function. nonetheless, adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices may result in losses in earnings, cash flows and/or fair values. the forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions, due to reliance on model assumptions. actual future results may differ materially from those presented. these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible losses. commodity price risk ppl uses various methodologies to simulate forward price curves in the energy markets to estimate the size and probability of changes in market value resulting from commodity price movements. the methodologies require several key assumptions, including selection of confidence levels, the holding period of the commodity positions and the depth and applicability to future periods of historical commodity price information. as of december 31, 2001, ppl estimated that a 10% adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of its non-hedge portfolio by an insignificant amount, as compared to a $6 million decrease at december 31, 2000. a similar adverse movement in market prices would have decreased the value of its hedge portfolio by approximately $8 million at december 31, 2001, as compared to a $292 million decrease at december 31, 2000. however, the change in the value of the hedge portfolio would have been offset by an increase in the value of the underlying commodity, the electricity generated. the decline in forward prices from 2000 to 2001 is the primary reason for the differences between 2001 and 2000's sensitivity analyses. in addition to commodity price risk, ppl's commodity positions are also subject to operational and event risks including, among others, increases in load demand and forced outages at power plants. ppl's risk management program is designed to manage the risks associated with market fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas, oil and emission allowances. ppl's risk management policy and programs include risk identification and risk limits management, with measurement and controls for real-time monitoring. ppl has entered into forward, option and tolling contracts that require physical delivery of the commodity, as well as futures, exchange-for-physical transactions and other financial contracts (such as swap agreements where settlement is generally based on the difference between a fixed-price and an index-based price for the underlying commodity). ppl expects to continue to use these contracts. ppl enters into contracts to hedge the impact of market fluctuations on ppl's energy-related assets, liabilities and other contractual arrangements. ppl also executes these contracts to take advantage of market opportunities. as a result, ppl may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated. interest rate risk ppl and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations. ppl utilizes various financial derivative products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating-rate interest rates in its debt portfolios, adjusting the duration of its debt portfolios and locking in u.s. treasury rates (and interest rate spreads over treasuries) in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and losses in the fair value of ppl's debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates. at december 31, 2001, ppl's potential annual exposure to increased interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was estimated at $6 million, as compared to a $7 million increase at december 31, 2000. ppl is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its debt portfolio. at december 31, 2001, ppl estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its debt portfolio, through a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, was $111 million, as compared to $66 million at december 31, 2000. ppl utilizes various risk management instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse interest rate movements for future anticipated financings. while ppl is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments, they are designed such that an economic loss in value should generally be offset by interest rate savings at the time the future anticipated financing is completed. at december 31, 2001, ppl estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of these instruments, through a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, was approximately $13 million, as compared to an $18 million exposure at december 31, 2000. see notes 9 and 19 to the financial statements for a discussion of financial derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2001. foreign currency risk ppl is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through investments in affiliates in latin america and europe. in addition, ppl may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than u.s. dollars. ppl has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities and net investments. during the first quarter of 2001, ppl entered into contracts for the forward purchase of 51 million euros to pay for certain equipment in 2002 and 2003. the estimated value of these forward purchases as of december 31, 2001, being the amount ppl would have to pay to terminate them, was $3 million. at december 31, 2000, ppl had a forward purchase contract for 37 million euros. the estimated amount that ppl would have had to pay to terminate the forward purchases was insignificant. nuclear decommissioning fund - securities price risk in order to meet nrc requirements, ppl susquehanna maintains trust funds to fund certain costs of decommissioning the susquehanna station. as of december 31, 2001, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities and are reflected at fair value on ppl's balance sheet. the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund susquehanna's decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. however, the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets, and the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. ppl susquehanna actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement. at december 31, 2001, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated $17 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets, as compared to an $18 million reduction at december 31, 2000. ppl electric's 1998 restructuring settlement agreement provides for the collection of authorized nuclear decommissioning costs through the ctc. additionally, ppl electric is permitted to seek recovery from customers of up to 96% of any increases in these costs. under the power supply agreement between ppl electric and ppl energyplus, these revenues are passed on to ppl energyplus. similarly, these revenues are passed on to ppl susquehanna under a power supply agreement between ppl energyplus and ppl susquehanna. therefore, ppl's securities price risk is expected to remain insignificant. report of independent accountants to the board of directors and shareowners of ppl corporation: in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under item 14(a)(1) on page 176 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ppl corporation and its subsidiaries ("ppl") at december 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 14(a)(2) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. these financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of ppl's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the united states of america, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. as discussed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, ppl changed its method of accounting for derivative and hedging activities pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no. 138, accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities (an amendment of fasb statement 133). ppl also changed its method of accounting for amortizing unrecognized gains or losses in the annual pension expense/income determined under statement of financial accounting standards no. 87, employers' accounting for pensions, as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. pricewaterhousecoopers llp philadelphia, pa february 4, 2002 ppl corporation management's report on responsibility for financial statements the management of ppl is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the consolidated financial statements and all other sections of this annual report. the financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and the uniform system of accounts prescribed by the federal energy regulatory commission for regulated domestic businesses. in preparing the financial statements, management makes informed estimates and judgments of the expected effects of events and transactions based upon currently available facts and circumstances. management believes that the financial statements are free of material misstatements and present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of ppl. ppl's consolidated financial statements have been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp (pwc), independent certified public accountants. pwc's appointment as auditors was previously ratified by the shareowners. management has made available to pwc all ppl's financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of shareowners' and directors' meetings. management believes that all representations made to pwc during its audit were valid and appropriate. ppl maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance as to the integrity and reliability of the financial statements, the protection of assets from unauthorized use or disposition and the prevention and detection of fraudulent financial reporting. the concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a system of internal control should not exceed the benefits derived and that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control. fundamental to the control system is the selection and training of qualified personnel, an organizational structure that provides appropriate segregation of duties, the utilization of written policies and procedures and the continual monitoring of the system for compliance. in addition, ppl maintains an internal auditing program to evaluate ppl's system of internal control for adequacy, application and compliance. management considers the internal auditors' and pwc's recommendations concerning its system of internal control and has taken actions which are believed to be cost-effective in the circumstances to respond appropriately to these recommendations. management believes that ppl's system of internal control is adequate to accomplish the objectives discussed in this report. the board of directors, acting through its audit committee, oversees management's responsibilities in the preparation of the financial statements. in performing this function, the audit committee, which is composed of four independent directors, meets periodically with management, the internal auditors and pwc to review the work of each. pwc and the internal auditors have free access to the audit committee and to the board of directors, without management present, to discuss internal accounting control, auditing and financial reporting matters. management also recognizes its responsibility for fostering a strong ethical climate so that ppl's affairs are conducted according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. this responsibility is characterized and reflected in the business policies and guidelines of ppl's operating subsidiaries. these policies and guidelines address: the necessity of ensuring open communication within ppl; potential conflicts of interest; proper procurement activities; compliance with all applicable laws, including those relating to financial disclosure; and the confidentiality of proprietary information. william f. hecht chairman, president and chief executive officer john r.

(b) the preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon the repayment of the subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption. at the option of ppl electric, the subordinated debentures are redeemable on and after april 1, 2002 (for the 8.20% securities) and july 1, 2002 (for the 8.10% securities) in whole at any time or in part from time to time. the amount of preferred securities subject to such mandatory redemption will be equal to the amount of related subordinated debentures maturing or being redeemed. the redemption price is $25 per preferred security plus an amount equal to accumulated and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption. (c) in may 2001, ppl and ppl capital funding trust i issued $575 million of 7.75% peps units. each peps unit consists of (i) a contract to purchase shares of ppl common stock on or prior to may 18, 2004 and (ii) a trust preferred security of ppl capital funding trust i with a stated liquidation amount of $25. each purchase contract requires ppl to make contract adjustment payments of .46% per year, paid quarterly, on the $25 stated amount of the peps unit and requires the holders of the contracts to purchase a number of shares of ppl common stock on or prior to may 18, 2004. the number of shares required to be purchased will depend on the average market price of ppl's common stock prior to the purchase date, subject to certain limitations. the holders' obligations to purchase shares under the purchase contracts may be settled with the proceeds of a remarketing of the preferred securities, which have been pledged to secure these obligations. the distribution rate on each preferred security is 7.29% per year, paid quarterly, until may 18, 2004. the trust's sole source of funds for distributions are from payments of interest on the 7.29% subordinated notes of ppl capital funding, due may 18, 2006, issued to the trust. the preferred securities are expected to be remarketed in the first half of 2004. upon a remarketing, the interest rate on the subordinated notes and the distribution rate on the preferred securities will be reset at a rate that will be equal to or greater than 7.29%. ppl has guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on the subordinated notes issued to the trust by ppl capital funding. ppl has also guaranteed the distributions on the preferred securities to the extent the trust has funds available for payment. the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of the financial statements. consolidated statement of long-term debt at december 31, ppl corporation and subsidiaries (millions of dollars) outstanding 2001 2000 maturity (a) first mortgage bonds (b) 7-3/4% $ 28 $ 28 may 1, 2002 6-7/8% 19 19 february 1, 2003 6-7/8% 25 25 march 1, 2004 6-1/2% 110 (c) 125 april 1, 2005 6.55% 146 (d) 150 march 1, 2006 6-1/8% (e) 200 may 1, 2006 7-3/8% 10 10 2012-2016 9-3/8% (f) 5 2017-2021 6-3/4% to 8-1/2% 83 83 2022-2026 first mortgage pollution control bonds (b) 6.40% series h 90 90 november 1, 2021 5.50% series i 53 53 february 15, 2027 6.40% series j 116 116 september 1, 2029 6.15% series k 55 55 august 1, 2029 senior secured bonds (b) 5-7/8% 300 (g) august 15, 2007 6-1/4% 500 (g) august 15, 2009 1,535 959 series 1999-1 transition bonds 6.08% to 7.15% 1,923 (h) 2,164 2001-2008 medium-term notes 5.75% to 8.375% 1,347 (i) 1,487 2001-2007 6.40% senior unsecured notes 500 (j) november 1, 2011 1.54% pollution control revenue bonds 9 9 june 1, 2027 8.70% to 9.64% - unsecured promissory notes 13 (k) 16 2005-2022 other long-term debt 264 (l) 155 2001-2024 5,591 4,790 fair value swaps 3 unamortized discount (15) (6) 5,579 4,784 less amount due within one year (498) (317) total long-term debt $ 5,081 $ 4,467 (a) aggregate long-term debt maturities through 2006 are (millions of dollars): 2002, $498; 2003, $400; 2004, $413; 2005, $855; 2006, $513. there are no bonds or notes outstanding that have sinking fund requirements. (b) the first mortgage bonds and the first mortgage pollution control bonds were issued under, and are secured by, the lien of the 1945 first mortgage bond indenture. the lien of the 1945 first mortgage bond indenture covers substantially all electric transmission and distribution plant owned by ppl electric. the senior secured bonds were issued under the 2001 senior secured bond indenture. the senior secured bonds are secured by (i) an equal principal amount of first mortgage bonds issued under the 1945 first mortgage bond indenture, and (ii) the lien of the 2001 senior secured bond indenture, which covers substantially all electric transmission and distribution plant owned by ppl electric and which is junior to the lien of the 1945 first mortgage bond indenture.

(see note 22). the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of the financial statements. ppl corporation notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies business and consolidation ppl is an energy and utility holding company based in allentown, pennsylvania. ppl is the parent of ppl energy funding, ppl electric, ppl gas utilities, ppl services and ppl capital funding. ppl energy funding is the parent of ppl energy supply, which serves as the holding company for ppl's principal unregulated subsidiaries: ppl generation, ppl energyplus and ppl global. the principal business of ppl generation is owning and operating u.s. generating facilities through various subsidiaries. the principal business of ppl energyplus is unregulated wholesale and retail energy marketing. ppl global's principal businesses are the acquisition and development of both u.s. and international energy projects, and the ownership and operation of international energy projects. ppl electric is the principal regulated subsidiary of ppl. ppl electric's principal businesses are the transmission and distribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central pennsylvania, and the supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a plr. ppl consolidates the financial statements of its affiliates when it has control. all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. minority interests in operating results and equity ownership are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. the consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of all controlled affiliates on a current basis, with the exception of certain ppl global investments. it is the policy of ppl global to consolidate foreign affiliates and record equity in earnings of foreign affiliates on a lag, based on the availability of financial data on a u.s. gaap basis: equity earnings from wpd 1953, the parent of wpd (south west) and wpd (south wales), and wpdl are recorded on a one-month lag. ppl global has 51% equity ownership interests in these entities but has joint control of these investments with mirant. earnings from all other foreign equity method investments are recorded on a three-month lag. ppl global consolidates the results of controlled subsidiaries, emel, ec, the bolivian subsidiaries and other investments, on a one-month lag. the results of cemar are consolidated on a three-month lag. the portion of the subsidiaries' earnings owned by outside shareowners is included in "minority interest" in the consolidated financial statements. ppl global's 8.5% investment in cge is accounted for using the cost method. dividends from cge are recorded as income when received. use of estimates/contingencies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. ppl records loss contingencies in accordance with sfas 5, "accounting for contingencies." accounting records the accounting records for ppl electric and ppl gas utilities are maintained in accordance with the uniform system of accounts prescribed by the ferc and adopted by the puc. regulation historically, ppl electric accounted for its regulated operations in accordance with the provisions of sfas 71, "accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation," which requires rate-regulated entities to reflect the effects of regulatory decisions in their financial statements. ppl electric discontinued application of sfas 71 for the generation portion of its business, effective june 30, 1998. in connection with the corporate realignment, effective july 1, 2000, ppl electric's generating and certain other related assets, along with associated liabilities, were transferred to new unregulated subsidiaries of ppl generation. ppl electric's remaining regulated business, ppl gas utilities and certain ppl global affiliates continue to be subject to sfas 71. property, plant and equipment following are the classes of electric plant in service, with the associated accumulated depreciation, at december 31 (millions of dollars): 2001 2000 generation $ 7,208 $ 6,801 transmission and distribution 4,170 3,521 general 491 459 11,869 10,781 less: accumulated depreciation 6,342 5,470 $ 5,527 $ 5,311 property, plant and equipment is recorded at original cost, unless impaired under the provisions of sfas 121, "accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of." original cost includes material, labor, contractor costs, construction overheads and financing costs, where applicable. the cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. when a component of property, plant or equipment is retired that was depreciated under the composite or group method, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. when all or a significant portion of an operating unit is retired or sold that was depreciated under the composite or group method, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by regulators. afudc is capitalized as part of the construction costs for regulated projects. interest is capitalized as part of construction costs for non-regulated projects. depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods. the annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: generation, 5-50 years; transmission and distribution, 15-80 years; and general, 5-80 years. ppl periodically reviews and adjusts the depreciable lives of its fixed assets. asset impairment long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles held and used by ppl and its subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. such reviews are performed in accordance with sfas 121. impairment losses on such long-lived assets are recognized when book values exceed expected undiscounted future cash flow with the impairment measured on a discounted future cash flows basis. equity investments are reviewed for impairment in accordance with apb opinion no. 18, "the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock". apb opinion no. 18 provides that "a loss in value of an investment which is other than a temporary decline should be recognized." ppl identifies and measures loss in value of equity investments based upon a comparison of fair value to carrying value. see note 18 for the impact of sfas 144 on accounting for asset impairments. amortization of goodwill goodwill, which is included in "regulatory and other noncurrent assets - other" on the balance sheet, is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed 40 years. the excess cost over fair value of ppl global's investments in unconsolidated affiliates is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period not in excess of 40 years. see note 18 for the impact of sfas 142 on accounting for goodwill. recoverable transition costs based on the puc final order, ppl electric was amortizing its competitive transition (or stranded) costs over an 11-year transition period effective january 1, 1999. in august 1999, competitive transition costs of $2.4 billion were converted to intangible transition costs when securitized by the issuance of transition bonds. the intangible transition costs are being amortized over the life of the transition bonds, august 1999 through december 2008, in accordance with an amortization schedule filed with the puc. the assets of ppl transition bond company, including the intangible transition property, are not available to creditors of ppl or ppl electric. the transition bonds are obligations of ppl transition bond company and are non-recourse to ppl and ppl electric. the remaining competitive transition costs are also being amortized based on an amortization schedule previously filed with the puc, adjusted for those competitive transition costs that were converted to intangible transition costs. as a result of the conversion of a significant portion of the competitive transition costs into intangible transition costs, amortization of substantially all of the remaining competitive transition costs will occur in 2009. accounting for price risk management ppl enters into commodity contracts for the physical purchase and sale of energy as well as energy contracts that can be settled financially. ppl enters into interest rate derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to changes in the fair value of its debt instruments, as well as its exposure to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing debt instruments or forecasted transactions. ppl also enters into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions or net investments. as of january 1, 2001, contracts that meet the definition of a derivative were accounted for under sfas 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities." certain energy contracts have been excluded from sfas 133's requirements because they meet the definition of a "normal sale or purchase" under dig issue c15, "scope exceptions: normal purchases and normal sales exception for certain option-type contracts and forward contracts in electricity." these contracts are reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting. see note 19 for additional information on sfas 133. under sfas 133, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. on the date the derivative contract is executed, ppl designates the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ("fair value" hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ("cash flow" hedge), a foreign currency fair value or cash flow hedge ("foreign currency" hedge), a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, or a non-hedge derivative. changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as, and is designated and qualifies as, a fair value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current-period earnings. changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as, and is designated as and qualifies as, a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows being hedged. changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as and qualify as, foreign currency hedges are recorded in either current-period earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the hedge transaction is a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. if, however, a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustments account within equity. changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings. in addition, ppl has entered into non-derivative contracts that meet the definition of energy trading activities as defined by eitf 98-10, "accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities." in accordance with eitf 98-10, energy trading contract gains and losses from changes in market prices are marked to market through earnings. for 1999 and 2000, ppl used eitf 98-10 to account for its commodity forward and financial contracts. as such, contracts that did not meet the definition of energy trading contracts, as defined by eitf 98-10, were reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting. the gains or losses on interest rate derivative contracts that settled prior to the adoption of sfas 133 were deferred and are being recognized over the life of the debt. market gains and losses on foreign currency derivative contracts that settled prior to the adoption of sfas 133 were recognized in accordance with sfas 52, "foreign currency translation," and are included in "foreign currency translation adjustments," a component of "accumulated other comprehensive income" on the balance sheet. gains and losses from changes in market prices of energy sales contracts are accounted for in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues; gains and losses from changes in market prices of energy purchase contracts are accounted for in "energy purchases" on the statement of income. the amortized gains and losses from interest rate derivative contracts are accounted for in "interest expense." revenue recognition "retail electric and gas" and "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues are recorded based on deliveries through the end of the calendar month. unbilled retail revenues result because customers meters are read and bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than all being read at the end of the month. unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kwh by the estimated average cents per kwh. "energy related businesses" revenue includes revenues from ppl global and the mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries. ppl global's revenue reflects its proportionate share of affiliate earnings under the equity method of accounting, as described in the "business and consolidation" section of note 1, and dividends received from its investments are accounted for using the cost method. the mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries record profits from construction contracts on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. income from time and material contracts is recognized currently as the work is performed. costs include all direct material and labor costs and job-related overhead. provisions for estimated loss on uncompleted contacts, if any, are made in the period in which such losses are determined. income taxes the income tax provision for ppl is calculated in accordance with sfas 109, "accounting for income taxes." the provision for ppl electric's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the puc and ferc. the difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under u.s. gaap is deferred and included in taxes recoverable through future rates in "regulatory and other noncurrent assets - other" on the balance sheet. see note 7 for additional information. ppl electric deferred investment tax credits when they were utilized, and is amortizing the deferrals over the average lives of the related assets. ppl and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. leases see note 12 for a discussion on accounting for leases. pension and other postretirement benefits see note 14 for a discussion on accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. cash equivalents all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. comprehensive income comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, defined as changes in common equity from transactions not related to shareowners. other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and qualifying derivatives, the excess of additional pension liability over unamortized prior service costs, and foreign currency translation adjustments recorded by ppl global. comprehensive income is reflected on the statement of shareowners' common equity and comprehensive income, and "accumulated other comprehensive income" is presented on the balance sheet. the accumulated other comprehensive income of ppl consisted of (in millions): december 31, 2001 2000 foreign currency translation adjustments $ (268 ) $ (34 ) unrealized gains on qualifying derivatives 23 minimum pension liability (5 ) (5 ) unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities (1 ) 3 $ (251 ) $ (36 ) treasury stock treasury shares are reflected on the balance sheet as an offset to common equity under the cost method of accounting. management has no definitive plans for the future use of these shares. treasury shares are not considered outstanding in calculating eps. foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of international operations, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated at year-end exchange rates, and related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. adjustments resulting from translation are recorded in "accumulated other comprehensive income." the effect of translation adjustments on other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, is disclosed in the statement of shareowners' common equity and comprehensive income. gains or losses relating to foreign currency transactions are recognized in income currently. the aggregate transaction gain was $8 million in 2001, and was not significant in 2000. project development costs ppl global expenses the costs of evaluating potential acquisition and development opportunities as incurred. acquisition and development costs are capitalized upon approval of the investment by the ppl global board of managers and the finance committee of ppl's board of directors or, if later, the achievement of sufficient project milestones such that the economic viability of the project is reasonably assured. the level of assurance needed for capitalization of such costs requires that all major uncertainties be resolved and that there be a high probability that the project will proceed as planned, or that such costs will be recoverable through long-term operations, a financing or a sale. the continued capitalization of project development and acquisition costs is subject to on-going risks related to successful completion. in the event that ppl global determines that a particular project is no longer viable, previously capitalized costs are charged to expense in the period that such determination is made. reclassification certain amounts in the 2000 and 1999 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. segment and related information ppl's reportable segments are supply, delivery and international. the supply group primarily consists of the domestic energy marketing, generation and domestic development operations of ppl energy supply. the delivery group includes the regulated electric and gas delivery operations of ppl electric and ppl gas utilities. the international group includes ppl global's responsibility for the acquisition, development, ownership and operation of international energy projects. the majority of ppl global's international investments are located in the u.k., chile, el salvador and brazil. segments include direct charges, as well as an allocation of indirect corporate costs, for services provided by ppl services. these service costs include functions such as financial, legal, human resources and information services. see note 23 for a discussion of the contract between ppl electric and ppl energyplus. previously, there was a "development" group that included the activities now reflected in the "international" group and the domestic development operations, currently part of the "supply" group. previously reported information has been restated to conform to the current presentation. financial data for ppl's business segments are as follows (millions of dollars): 2001 2000 1999 income

and $800 million at december 31, 2001 and 2000. the most significant investment was ppl global's investment in wpd 1953, which was $328 million at december 31, 2001 and $479 million at december 31, 2000. wpd 1953 owns wpd (south west) and wpd (south wales). see note 22 for a discussion on the write-down of international energy projects. at december 31, 2001, ppl global had a 51% equity ownership interest in wpd 1953, but shared joint control with mirant. accordingly, ppl global accounts for its investment in wpd 1953 (and other investments where it has majority ownership but lacks control) under the equity method of accounting. investment in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method at december 31, 2001, and the effective equity ownership percentages, were as follows: ppl global: aguaytia energy, llc - 11.4% bolivian generating group, llc - 29.3% hidrocentrais reunidas, lda - 50.0% hidro iberica, b. v. - 50.0% latin american energy &amp; electricity fund

net income (a) 248 131 427 (a)the decrease in revenues and net income in 2001 and 2000 from 1999 were in part due to the sale of the supply business of wpd (south west), formerly sweb, in the fourth quarter of 1999. earnings per share basic eps is calculated by dividing "net income" on the statement of income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. in the calculation of diluted eps, weighted average shares outstanding are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock. potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options granted under the incentive compensation plans (see note 13), stock units representing common stock granted under directors compensation programs and peps units. preferred dividends are included in net income in the computation of basic and diluted eps. the basic and diluted eps calculations, and the reconciliation of the shares used in the calculations, are shown below: 2001 2000 1999 (millions of dollars or thousands of shares) income (numerator ) net income - before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in

cumulative effect of a change in accounting for pension gains and losses. the pro-forma effect of retroactive application of this change in accounting, from reported results, is as follows: 2001 2000 1999 1998 and prior years increase (decrease) net income ($ millions) $ (10 ) $ 7 $ 3 eps $ (.07 ) $ .05 $ .02 in may 2001, ppl issued 23 million peps units that contain a purchase contract component for ppl's common stock. the purchase contract would settle between 8.8 million and 10.8 million of ppl's common shares, depending on a conversion ratio tied to the price of ppl's common stock. the peps units will only be dilutive if the average price of ppl's common stock exceeds $65.03 for any period. therefore, they were excluded from the diluted eps calculations. stock options to purchase approximately 896,000 ppl common shares for 2001 were not included in that period's computation of diluted eps because the exercise price of the options was greater than the average market price of the common shares. therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive. extraordinary items in august 1999, ppl transition bond company issued $2.4 billion of transition bonds to securitize a portion of ppl electric's stranded costs. ppl electric used a portion of the securitization proceeds to repurchase $1.5 billion of its first mortgage bonds. the premiums and related expenses to reacquire these bonds were $59 million, net of tax. in august 1999, ppl electric released approximately $78 million of deferred income taxes associated with the ctc that was no longer required because of securitization. the net securitization impact of the bond repurchase and the deferred tax change was a gain of $19 million. sfas 4, "reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt," requires that a material aggregate gain or loss from the extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. the $59 million loss associated with the bond repurchase was treated as an extraordinary item. details were as follows (millions of dollars): reacquisition cost of debt $ 1,554 net carrying amount of debt (1,454 ) extraordinary charge pre-tax 100 tax effects (41 ) extraordinary charge $ 59 this extraordinary charge was partially offset in december 1999 with a credit relating to wholesale power activity. in december 2000, there was an additional extraordinary credit relating to wholesale power activity. sales to other electric utilities under ferc-approved interconnection and power supply agreements, ppl energyplus supplied capacity and energy to ugi. these agreements were terminated in february 2001. ppl energyplus had a contract to provide bg&amp;e with 129,000 kilowatts, or 6.6%, of ppl susquehanna's share of capacity and related energy from the susquehanna station. ppl energyplus provided 407 million kwh to bg&amp;e through may 2001, at which point the contract ended. ppl montana provided power to montana power under two wholesale transition sales agreements. one agreement expired in december 2001 and the second agreement expires in june 2002. see note 16 for more information regarding a new power supply agreement beginning in july 2002. income and other taxes for 2001, 2000 and 1999, the corporate federal income tax rate was 35%. the statutory corporate net income tax rates for pennsylvania and montana were 9.99% and 6.75%. the tax effects of significant temporary differences comprising ppl's net deferred income tax liability were as follows (millions of dollars): 2001 2000 deferred tax

corporate joint ventures where management has determined that the earnings are permanently reinvested in the companies that produced them. the cumulative undistributed earnings are included in "earnings reinvested" on the balance sheet. the amounts considered permanently reinvested at december 31, 2001 and 2000 were $38 million and $27 million. it is not practical to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on these foreign earnings if they were remitted to ppl global. nuclear decommissioning costs the cost to decommission the susquehanna station is based on a site-specific study to dismantle and decommission each unit immediately following final shutdown. ppl susquehanna's 90% share of the total estimated cost of decommissioning the susquehanna station was approximately $724 million in 1993 dollars. this estimate includes decommissioning the radiological portions of the station and the cost of removal of non-radiological structures and materials. decommissioning costs are recorded as a component of depreciation expense. beginning in january 1999, in accordance with the puc final order, $130 million of decommissioning costs are being recovered from customers through the ctc over the 11-year life of the ctc rather than the remaining life of susquehanna. the recovery will include a return on unamortized decommissioning costs. decommissioning charges were $24 million in 2001, $26 million in 2000 and $27 million in 1999. amounts collected from ppl electric's customers for decommissioning, less applicable taxes, are deposited in external trust funds for investment and can be used only for future decommissioning costs. accrued nuclear decommissioning costs were $294 million and $280 million at december 31, 2001 and 2000, and are included in "deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities - other" on the balance sheet. in november 2001, ppl susquehanna notified the nrc that it intends to file for 20-year license renewals for each of the susquehanna units. if approved, the operating licenses would be extended from 2022 to 2042 for unit 1 and from 2024 to 2044 for unit 2. see note 18 for additional information on sfas 143, which could have a material impact on the accounting for the decommissioning of the susquehanna station. financial instruments the carrying amount on the balance sheet and the estimated fair value of ppl's

(d) these contracts were classified as non-trading under eitf 98-10 and were not required to be marked to fair value on the balance sheet in 2000. this table excludes derivative and non-derivative energy contracts that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument because physical delivery is expected. credit arrangements and financing activities credit arrangements in december 2000 and in january 2001, ppl capital funding entered into two short-term credit facilities. at march 31, 2001, ppl capital funding had borrowed $200 million under each facility at floating rates tied to either one, two or three-month libor. these funds were used for general corporate purposes, including making loans to ppl subsidiaries to reduce their debt balances. in may 2001, ppl capital funding repaid its borrowings under both facilities and the credit facilities were terminated. in order to enhance liquidity, and as a credit back-stop to their respective commercial paper programs, ppl electric, ppl capital funding and ppl (as guarantor for ppl capital funding) shared a 364-day $750 million credit facility and a five-year $300 million credit facility, each with a group of banks. in june 2001, these credit facilities were terminated, ppl electric entered into a new $400 million 364-day credit facility and ppl energy supply entered into two new credit facilities: a $600 million 364-day facility and a $500 million three-year facility. at december 31, 2001, no borrowings were outstanding under any of these facilities and $26 million of letters of credit were issued under the $500 million three-year facility. in addition, in june 2001, ppl capital funding entered into a 364-day credit facility with ppl energy supply. ppl had guaranteed ppl capital funding's obligations under this agreement. the credit facility and related guaranty were terminated in december 2001 when ppl capital funding terminated its commercial paper program and at that time no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility. ppl montana has a $100 million 3-year credit facility with certain lenders which matures in november 2002. the maturity date may be extended with the consent of the lenders. the credit facility provides that up to $75 million of the commitment may be used to cause lenders to issue letters of credit. in the event that ppl montana were to draw upon this facility or cause lenders to issue letters of credit on its behalf, ppl montana would be required to reimburse the issuing lenders. at december 31, 2001, $44 million of loans were outstanding under this facility and $25 million of letters of credit were issued. in april 2001, ppl montana executed a new credit facility to allow for incremental letter of credit capacity of $150 million. there were no letters of credit outstanding under this facility at december 31, 2001. ppl has executed a commitment to the lenders under ppl montana's $150 million credit facility that ppl will provide (or cause ppl energy supply to provide) letters of credit at such times and in such amounts as are necessary to permit ppl montana to remain in compliance with its fixed-price forward energy contracts or its derivative financial instruments entered into to manage energy price risks, to the extent that ppl montana cannot provide such letters of credit under its existing credit agreements. no such letters of credit had been issued as of december 31, 2001. the subsidiaries of ppl are separate legal entities. ppl's subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of ppl. accordingly, creditors of ppl may not satisfy their debts from the assets of the subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay ppl's creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation. similarly, ppl is not liable for the debts of its subsidiaries. accordingly, creditors of ppl's subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of ppl absent a specific contractual undertaking by ppl to pay the creditors of its subsidiaries or as required by applicable law or regulation. financing activities during december 2001: ppl electric terminated its existing commercial paper program and established a new $400 million program. ppl capital funding terminated its commercial paper program. ppl energy supply initiated a $1.1 billion commercial paper program. at december 31, 2001, there was no commercial paper outstanding under either the ppl electric or ppl energy supply programs. in march 2001, ppl electric bought back an option related to its 6-1/8% reset put securities due 2006. the option would have permitted a third party to remarket these securities, at higher interest rates, in may 2001. ppl electric retired the $200 million, 6-1/8% reset put securities in may 2001. in may 2001, ppl issued 23 million of 7.75% peps units for $575 million. see the "consolidated statement of company-obligated mandatorily redeemable securities" for information regarding the peps units. the $575 million of peps units are included in "company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely company debentures" on the balance sheet at december 31, 2001. net proceeds of $558 million were received, after giving effect to $17 million of issuance expenses. ppl used these proceeds to pay down short-term debt. the $17 million of issuance expenses were charged to "capital stock expense and other" on the balance sheet, as well as $7 million for the present value of the estimated liability for contract adjustment payments. in july 2001, ppl electric retired all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds, 9-3/8% series due 2021, at $5 million aggregate par value through the maintenance and replacement fund provisions of the 1945 first mortgage bond indenture. in august 2001, ppl electric issued $800 million of senior secured bonds as part of a strategic initiative. see note 23 for additional information. in september 2001, ppl electric repurchased $15 million aggregate par value of its first mortgage bonds, 6-1/2% series due 2005, at a market value that approximated par value. in october 2001, ppl energy supply sold $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.40% senior unsecured notes due 2011 in a private placement, and agreed to make an exchange offer to exchange the privately-placed senior notes for publicly-registered senior notes. the exchange was completed in february 2002. the new registered senior notes have the same material financial terms as the old senior notes. proceeds of the senior note offering will be used to fund generation development and for general corporate purposes. during november and december 2001, ppl capital funding repurchased $70 million, par value, of its medium-term notes, 7.75% series due 2015, at a market value of $76 million. during december 2001, ppl electric repurchased $4 million par value of its first mortgage bonds, 6.55% series due 2006, at a market value that approximated par value. ppl electric also repurchased 148,000 shares of its 6-1/8% series preferred stock, also at a market value that approximated par value. during the year 2001, ppl transition bond company made principal payments on bonds totaling $241 million. in december 2000, ppl initiated a structured equity shelf program for the issuance of up to $100 million in ppl common stock in small amounts on a periodic basis. as of december 31, 2001, ppl had issued $16 million of common stock under this program. in 2001, ppl global subsidiaries emel and cemar, issued $127 million and $99 million of long-term debt. a portion of cemar's debt was reclassified to short-term debt in conjunction with cemar's impairment. (see note 22.) see note 12 for a description of ppl's lease financings. acquisitions, development and divestitures domestic generation projects in january 2001, ppl montour acquired an additional interest in the coal-fired conemaugh power plant from potomac electric power company. under the terms of the acquisition agreement, ppl montour and a subsidiary of allegheny energy, inc. jointly acquired a 9.72% interest in the 1,711 mw plant. ppl montour paid $78 million for this additional 83 mw interest. the purchase increased ppl montour's ownership interest to 16.25% in the two-unit plant. in august 2001, construction began on the university park energy project, a 540 mw natural gas-fired facility located in university park, illinois and on the sundance energy project, a 450 mw natural gas-fired facility in pinal county, arizona. the projects are expected to be in service during the summer of 2002, at an estimated total project cost of approximately $675 million. ppl susquehanna also announced plans to increase the capacity of its susquehanna nuclear plant by 100 mw, with the installation of more efficient steam turbines on each of the two units. these improvements will be made in 2003 and 2004 and are expected to cost approximately $120 million. in december 2001, ppl global and the long island power authority entered into agreements to build two 80 mw combustion turbine power facilities at sites in shoreham and edgewood on long island, new york. both facilities are expected to be in service during the summer of 2002 at an estimated total project cost of approximately $180 million. in december 2001, a ppl global subsidiary entered into a synthetic lease financing transaction for the development, construction and operation of its lower mt. bethel combined cycle generating facility. the air quality plan approval issued by the pennsylvania dep for construction of the lower mt. bethel facility has been appealed by the new jersey dep. ppl energy supply and the ppl global subsidiary intend to work with the pennsylvania dep in opposing this appeal. in addition, the local township zoning hearing board granted zoning approval for the facility, but the approval has been appealed by a township resident as to the decibel levels allowed. an additional appeal was filed by the same resident to the township's issuance of a building permit pending the outcome of the zoning appeal. ppl energy supply and the ppl global subsidiary are aggressively opposing the zoning and building permit appeals. as a result of these three appeals, substantial additional requirements could be imposed on the construction and operation of the facility. if, as a result of these appeals, the construction of the facility could not be completed by september 30, 2004, the ppl global subsidiary, or ppl energy supply as guarantor, could be called upon to repay approximately 90% of the then-outstanding facility costs, plus a make-whole premium on the total amount of debt commitments. alternatively, ppl energy supply could, subject to certain conditions, purchase the facility from the lessor, offer to assume 100% of the outstanding debt, and pay a reduced make-whole premium to any debtholder that does not accept such offer. in light of continuing declines in wholesale energy prices in the eastern and western u.s. markets, ppl global is scaling back its generation development program. as a result, in december 2001, ppl global made a decision to cancel approximately 2,100 mw of previously planned generation development in pennsylvania and washington state. these projects were in the early stage of development and would have had an estimated capital cost of approximately $1.3 billion. the charge for cancellation of these generation projects, which was primarily due to cancellation fees under turbine purchase contracts, was approximately $150 million, and is reported on the statement of income as "cancellation of generation projects," a component of "other charges." international distribution projects in january 2001, ppl global purchased an additional 5.6% direct and indirect equity interest in cge from the claro group, bringing its total investment to $141 million, or about 8.5%. cge provides electricity delivery service to 1.4 million customers throughout chile and natural gas delivery service to 200,000 customers in santiago. in may 2001, wpdl successfully completed the sale of hyder's water business, welsh water, to the welsh firm glas cymru cyfyngedig for one british pound sterling and the assumption of all of welsh water's debt. in september 2001, ppl global increased its capital investment by 4.9% in cemar, by purchasing the 25.7 billion shares of cemar that were held by cemar's employees at a price of $13 million. the increase resulted in a total 89.6% ownership in cemar. in december 2001, ppl global purchased an 80% interest in el salvador telecom, a small telecommunications company in el salvador, for an initial investment of $8 million. in december 2001, ppl global recorded impairment charges for its investments in cemar, wpd 1953, and wpdl. see note 22 for additional information. leases ppl applies the provisions of sfas 13, "accounting for leases", to all leasing transactions. in addition, ppl applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for leases. in march 2000, ppl electric terminated its nuclear fuel lease and repurchased $154 million of nuclear fuel from the lessor energy trust. in july 2000, all nuclear fuel was transferred to ppl susquehanna in connection with the corporate realignment. in july 2000, ppl montana sold its interest in the colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to ppl montana under four 36-year operating leases. the proceeds from this sale approximated $410 million. ppl montana used the proceeds to reduce outstanding debt and make distributions to its parent, ppl generation. ppl montana leases a 50% interest in colstrip units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in unit 3, through four non-cancelable operating leases. the leases provide two renewal options based on the economic useful life of the generation assets. in november 2000, a ppl global subsidiary entered into a $555 million operating lease arrangement for turbine generator units and related equipment (scrs, transformers and spare engines). certain obligations of the ppl global subsidiary under this lease financing, including payment obligations, have been guaranteed by ppl. the units are expected to go into service as they are completed, beginning in 2002. in may 2001, a ppl global subsidiary entered into an operating lease arrangement, initially for $900 million and increased in july 2001 to $1.06 billion upon syndication, for the development, construction and operation of several commercial power generation facilities. certain obligations of the ppl global subsidiary under this lease financing, including payment obligations, have been guaranteed by ppl energy supply. in february 2002, the ppl global subsidiary reduced the available commitment under the lease to approximately $700 million. there is a residual value guarantee that is expected to be up to $545 million at the end of the lease. in december 2001, a ppl global subsidiary entered into an operating lease arrangement for $455 million for the development, construction and operation of a 600 mw gas-fired combined-cycle generation facility located in lower mt. bethel township, northampton county, pennsylvania. the facility is expected to be operational in 2004. certain obligations of the ppl global subsidiary under this lease financing, including payment obligations, have been guaranteed by ppl energy supply. there is a residual value guarantee that is expected to be up to $321 million at the end of the lease. in addition to the leasing arrangements discussed above, ppl also has leases for vehicles, office space, land, buildings, personal computers and other equipment. total future minimum lease payments for all operating leases are estimated as follows (millions of dollars): 2002, $368; 2003, $108; 2004, $147; 2005, $140; 2006, $106; and thereafter, $881. stock-based compensation under the ppl incentive compensation plan ("icp") and the incentive compensation plan for key employees ("icpke") (together, the "plans"), restricted shares of ppl common stock as well as stock options may be granted to officers and other key employees of ppl, ppl electric and other affiliated companies. awards under the plans are made in the common stock of ppl by the compensation and corporate governance committee ("ccgc") of the ppl board of directors in the case of the icp, and by the ppl corporate leadership council ("clc") in the case of the icpke. each plan limits the number of shares available for awards to two percent of the outstanding common stock of ppl on the first day of each calendar year. the maximum number of options which can be awarded under each plan to any single eligible employee in any calendar year is 1.5 million shares. any portion of these options that has not been granted may be carried over and used in any subsequent year. if any award lapses or is forfeited or the rights to the participant terminate, any shares of common stock are again available for grant. shares delivered under the plans may be in the form of authorized and unissued common stock, common stock held in treasury by ppl or common stock purchased on the open market (including private purchases) in accordance with applicable securities laws. restricted stock restricted shares of ppl common stock are outstanding shares with full voting and dividend rights. however, the shares are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death. restricted shares vest fully if control of ppl changes, as defined by the plans. restricted stock awards of 202,590; 440,549; and 108,800 shares, with per share weighted-average fair values of $43.09, $21.30, and $26.74, were granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999. compensation expense for 2001 was $6 million and less than $3 million in 2000 and 1999. at december 31, 2001, there were 660,572 restricted shares outstanding. these awards currently vest from three to twenty-three years from the date of grant. stock options under the plans, stock options may also be granted with an option exercise price per share not less than the fair market value of ppl's common stock on the date of grant. the options are exercisable beginning one year after the date of grant, assuming the individual is still employed by ppl or a subsidiary, in installments as determined by the ccgc in the case of the icp, and the clc in the case of the icpke. the ccgc and clc have discretion to accelerate the exercisability of the options. all options expire no later than ten years from the grant date. the options become exercisable if control of ppl changes, as defined by the plans. ppl applies apb opinion no. 25, "accounting for stock issued to employees," and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. since stock options are granted at the then current market price, no compensation cost has been recognized. compensation calculated in accordance with the disclosure requirements of sfas 123, "accounting for stock-based compensation," for 2001, 2000 and 1999 would have been $5 million, $2 million and less than $1 million. the impact on basic and diluted eps would have been approximately 2 cents per share in 2001, and approximately 1 cent per share in 2000. a summary of stock option activity follows: stock option activity number of options weighted average exercise price balance at december 31, 1998 options granted 704,800 $ 26.85 options forfeited (78,780 ) $

and postemployment benefits pension and other postretirement benefits ppl and its subsidiaries sponsor various pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans. ppl follows the guidance of sfas 87, "employers' accounting for pensions" and sfas 106, "employers' accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions" for these benefits. ppl and its subsidiaries also provide supplemental retirement benefits to directors, executives and other key management employees through unfunded nonqualified retirement plans. substantially all employees of ppl's subsidiaries will become eligible for certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement through contributory plans. postretirement benefits under the ppl retiree health plans (covering retirees of ppl electric and various other affiliated ppl companies) and for the north penn gas plans are paid from funded veba trusts sponsored by the respective companies. at december 31, 2001, ppl electric had a regulatory asset of $6 million related to postretirement benefits that is being amortized and recovered in rates with a remaining life of 11 years. net pension and postretirement medical benefit costs (credits) were (millions of dollars): pension benefits postretirement medical benefits 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 service cost $ 38 $ 40 $ 42 $ 5 $ 5 $ 5 interest cost 94 86 78 22 22 19

benefit cost (credit) $ (57 ) $ (8 ) $ 15 $ 28 $ 31 $ 29 the net periodic pension cost charged or (credited) to operating expense was $(47) million in 2001, $(6) million in 2000 and $9 million in 1999, excluding amounts charged or (credited) to construction and other non-expense accounts. in 2001 ppl changed its method of amortizing unrecognized gains or losses in the annual pension expense/income determined under sfas 87, "employers' accounting for pensions." this change resulted in a cumulative-effect credit of $10 million after-tax or $.07 per basic share, which is reflected as a "cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle" on the statement of income. under the old method, unrecognized gains and losses in excess of ten percent of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets were amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated average future service period of plan participants. under the new method, a second corridor will be utilized for unrecognized gains and losses in excess of thirty percent of the plan's projected benefit obligation. unrecognized gains and losses outside the second corridor will be amortized on a straight-line method over a period equal to one-half of the average future service period of the plan participants. the new method is preferable under sfas 87 because it provides more current recognition of gains and losses, thereby lessening the accumulation of unrecognized gains and losses. retiree health and welfare benefits costs charged to operating expense were approximately $21 million in 2001, $25 million in 2000 and $20 million in 1999, excluding amounts charged to construction and other non-expense accounts. postretirement medical costs at december 31, 2001 were based on the assumption that costs would increase 7.0% in 2001, then the rate of increase would decline gradually to 6% in 2006 and thereafter. a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend assumption would have the following effects (in millions): one percentage point increase decrease effect on service cost and interest cost components $ 1 $ (1 ) effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 11 $ (10 ) the following assumptions were used in the valuation of the benefit obligations: pension benefits 2001 2000 1999 discount rate 7.25% 7.5% 7.0% expected

december 31, 2001 and $33 million, $29 million and $0 as of december 31, 2000. ppl electric and its subsidiaries formerly engaged in coal mining accrued an additional liability for the cost of health care of their retired miners. at december 31, 2001, this liability was $22 million. the liability is the net of $52 million of estimated future benefit payments offset by $30 million of available assets in a ppl electric-funded veba trust. ppl subsidiaries engaged in the mechanical contracting business make contributions to various union-sponsored multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans. contributions of $14 million, $10 million and $8 million were made in 2001, 2000 and 1999. savings plans substantially all employees of ppl's subsidiaries are eligible to participate in deferred savings plans (401(k)s). contributions to the plans charged to operating expense approximated $10 million in 2001, $9 million in 2000 and $6 million in 1999. employee stock ownership plan ppl sponsors a non-leveraged esop, in which substantially all employees excluding those of ppl global, ppl montana, ppl gas utilities and the mechanical contractors are enrolled after one year of credited service. dividends paid on esop shares are treated as ordinary dividends by ppl. under existing income tax laws, ppl is permitted to deduct the amount of those dividends for income tax purposes and to contribute the resulting tax savings (dividend-based contribution) to the esop. the dividend-based contribution is used to buy shares of ppl's common stock and is expressly conditioned upon the deductibility of the contribution for federal income tax purposes. contributions to the esop are allocated to eligible participants' accounts as of the end of each year, based 75% on shares held in existing participants' accounts and 25% on the eligible participants' compensation. amounts charged as compensation expense for esop contributions approximated $4 million in each of 2001, 2000 and 1999. these amounts were offset by the dividend-based contribution tax savings and had no impact on ppl's earnings. esop shares outstanding at december 31, 2001 totaled 5,140,869, or 4% of total common shares outstanding, and are included in all eps calculations. postemployment benefits ppl subsidiaries provide health and life insurance benefits to disabled employees and income benefits to eligible spouses of deceased employees. postemployment benefits charged to operating expenses were not significant in 2001, 2000 or 1999. certain of ppl global subsidiaries, including emel, ec, elfec and integra, provide limited non-pension benefits to all current employees. all active employees are entitled to benefits in the event of termination or retirement in accordance with government sponsored programs. these plans generally obligate a company to pay one month's salary per year of service to employees in the event of involuntary termination. under certain plans, employees with five or more years of service are entitled to this payment in the event of voluntary or involuntary termination. there is no limit on the number of years of service in calculation of the benefit obligation. the liabilities for these plans are accounted for under the guidance of eitf 88-1 &quot;determination of vested benefit obligation for a defined benefit pension plan&quot; using what is commonly referred to as the &quot;shut down&quot; method, where a company records the undiscounted obligation as if it was payable at each balance sheet date. the combined liabilities for these plans at december 31, 2001 and 2000 were $6 million, and are recorded in &quot;deferred credits and noncurrent liabilities - other&quot; on the balance sheet. jointly-owned facilities at december 31, 2001, subsidiaries of ppl owned undivided interests in the following facilities (millions of dollars): ownership interest electric plant in service other property accumulated depreciation construction work in progress ppl generation generating stations susquehanna 90.00% $ 4,196 $ 3,525 $ 24 keystone 12.34% 71 46 6 wyman 8.33% 15 2 conemaugh 16.25% 185 58 4 merrill creek reservoir 8.37% $ 22 12 ppl montana also has 50% and 30% undivided leasehold interests in colstrip units 1 and 2, and colstrip unit 3, respectively. each ppl generation subsidiary provided its own funding for its share of the facility. each receives a portion of the total output of the generating stations equal to its percentage ownership. the share of fuel and other operating costs associated with the stations is reflected on the statement of income. commitments and contingent liabilities ppl and its subsidiaries are involved in numerous legal proceedings, claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. ppl and its subsidiaries cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material liabilities. wholesale energy commitments as part of the purchase of generation assets from montana power, ppl montana agreed to supply electricity under two wholesale transition service agreements. in addition, ppl montana assumed a power purchase agreement and another power sales agreement. in accordance with purchase accounting guidelines, ppl montana recorded a liability of $118 million as the estimated fair value of these agreements at the acquisition date. the liability is being amortized over the agreement terms as adjustments to "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues and "energy purchases" on the statement of income. the unamortized balance at december 31, 2001 was $78 million and is included in "other" in the "deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities" section of the balance sheet. in october 2001, ppl announced that ppl energyplus had reached an agreement to supply montana power with an aggregate of 450 mw of energy to be supplied by ppl montana. the delivery term of this new contract is for five years beginning july 1, 2002, which is the day after the termination date of the last of the two existing contracts, pursuant to which ppl montana presently supplies energy to montana power for its default supply. under the agreement, ppl energyplus will supply 300 mw of around-the-clock electricity and 150 mw of on-peak electricity. in december 2001, the agreement was accepted for filing by the ferc. no further regulatory approvals are required under this agreement. liability for above market nug contracts in 1998, ppl electric recorded a loss accrual for above market contracts with nugs of $854 million, when its generation business was deregulated. effective january 1999, ppl electric began reducing this liability as an offset to "energy purchases" on the statement of income. this reduction is based on the estimated timing of the purchases from the nugs and projected market prices for this generation. the final existing nug contract expires in 2014. in connection with the corporate realignment, effective july 1, 2000, the remaining balance of this liability was transferred to ppl energyplus. the liabilities associated with these above market nug contracts were $580 million at december 31, 2001. commitments - acquisitions and development activities ppl global and its subsidiaries have committed additional capital and extended loans to certain affiliates, joint ventures and partnerships in which they have an interest. at december 31, 2001, ppl global and its subsidiaries had approximately $561 million of such commitments. the majority of these commitments were for the purchase of lm-6000 turbine generators from general electric. the general electric commitments have been reduced due to the decision to cancel generation projects as described in note 11. mpsc order in june 2001, the mpsc issued an order (mpsc order) in which it found that montana power must continue to provide electric service to its customers at tariffed rates until its transition plan under the montana electricity utility industry restructuring and customer choice act is finally approved, and that purchasers of generating assets from montana power must provide electricity to meet montana power's full load requirements at prices to montana power that reflect costs calculated as if the generating assets had not been sold. ppl montana purchased montana power's interests in two coal-fired plants and 11 hydroelectric units in 1999. in july 2001, ppl montana filed a complaint against the mpsc with the u.s. district court in helena, montana, challenging the mpsc order. in its complaint, ppl montana asserted, among other things, that the federal power act preempts states from exercising regulatory authority over the sale of electricity in wholesale markets, and requested the court to declare the mpsc action preempted, unconstitutional and void. in addition, the complaint requested that the mpsc be enjoined from seeking to exercise any authority, control or regulation of wholesale sales from ppl montana's generating assets. at this time, ppl montana cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings related to the mpsc order, what actions the mpsc, the montana legislature or any other governmental authority may take on these or related matters, or the ultimate impact on ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl montana of any of these matters. montana power shareholders' litigation in august 2001, a purported class-action lawsuit was filed by a group of shareholders of montana power against montana power, the directors of montana power, certain unnamed advisors and consultants of montana power, and ppl montana. the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that montana power was required to, and did not, obtain shareholder approval of the sale of montana power's generation assets to ppl montana in 1999. although most of the claims in the complaint are against montana power, its board of directors, and its consultants and advisors, two claims are asserted against ppl montana. in the first claim, plaintiffs seek a declaration that because montana power shareholders did not vote on the 1999 sale of generating assets to ppl montana, that sale "was null and void ab initio." the second claim alleges that ppl montana was privy to and participated in a strategy whereby montana power would sell its generation assets to ppl montana without first obtaining montana power shareholder approval, and that ppl montana has made net profits in excess of $100 million as the result of this alleged illegal sale. in the second claim, plaintiffs request that the court impose a "resulting and/or constructive trust" on both the generation assets themselves and all profits, plus interest on the amounts subject to the trust. ppl montana is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. puc investigation order in november 2001, the pjm market monitor publicly released a report prepared for the puc entitled "capacity market questions" relating to the pricing of installed capacity in the pjm daily market during the first quarter of 2001. the report concludes that ppl energyplus (identified in the report as "entity 1") was able to exercise market power to raise the market-clearing price above the competitive level during that period. ppl energyplus does not agree with the market monitor's conclusions that it exercised market power; in addition, the market monitor acknowledged in his report that pjm's standards and rules did not prohibit ppl energyplus' conduct. in november 2001, the puc issued an investigation order directing its law bureau to conduct an investigation into the pjm capacity market and the allegations in the market monitor's report. in january 2002, ppl filed comments as requested by the investigation order. the order does not suggest what, if any, action the puc may take as a result of the investigation, other than considering possible changes to its competitive safeguards. while ppl energyplus and ppl electric have filed comments with the puc as part of the investigation, they have taken the position that the puc does not have jurisdiction to regulate the pjm capacity markets as those markets are for wholesale electricity transactions and accordingly are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ferc. in addition, ppl energyplus and ppl electric believe that ppl energyplus' actions under review were at all times lawful and consistent with the rules of the market. at this time, neither ppl energyplus nor ppl electric can predict the outcome of the puc investigation or what action the puc may take in connection with the investigation. ferc market-based rates in december 1998, the ferc issued an order authorizing ppl energyplus to make wholesale sales of electric power and related products at market-based rates. in that order, the ferc directed ppl energyplus to file an updated market analysis within three years of the date of the order, and every three years thereafter. ppl energyplus filed its initial updated market analysis in december 2001. several parties thereafter filed interventions and protests requesting that, in light of the pjm market monitor's report described above, ppl energyplus be required to provide additional information demonstrating that it has met the ferc's market power tests necessary for ppl energyplus to continue its market-based rate authority. ppl energyplus has responded to those protests and interventions. ppl energyplus has taken the position that the ferc does not require the economic test suggested by the intervenors and that, in any event, it would meet such economic test if required by the ferc. the matter is currently pending before the ferc. proposed montana hydroelectric initiative in january 2002, the montana secretary of state certified, in accordance with applicable statutes, that it had approved the form of a proposed montana &quot;hydroelectric security act&quot; initiative. the proposed initiative may be placed on the november 2002 statewide ballot if sufficient signatures are obtained prior to june 21, 2002. among the stated purposes of the proposed initiative is to create an elected montana public power commission to determine whether purchasing hydroelectric dams in montana is in the public interest. such a commission could decide to acquire ppl montana's hydroelectric dams either pursuant to a negotiated purchase or an acquisition at fair market value through the power of condemnation. at this time, ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl montana cannot predict whether the proposed initiative will garner enough signatures for placement on the november 2002 statewide ballot, whether there will be a successful legal challenge to the initiative, whether it would pass if on the ballot or what impact, if any, the measure might ultimately have upon ppl montana or its hydroelectric operations. ppl montana has declared its opposition to, and intends to vigorously oppose, the initiative. nuclear insurance ppl susquehanna is a member of certain insurance programs which provide coverage for property damage to members' nuclear generating stations. facilities at the susquehanna station are insured against property damage losses up to $2.75 billion under these programs. ppl susquehanna is also a member of an insurance program which provides insurance coverage for the cost of replacement power during prolonged outages of nuclear units caused by certain specified conditions. under the property and replacement power insurance programs, ppl susquehanna could be assessed retroactive premiums in the event of the insurers' adverse loss experience. at december 31, 2001, this maximum assessment was about $20 million. ppl susquehanna's public liability for claims resulting from a nuclear incident at the susquehanna station is limited to about $9.5 billion under provisions of the price anderson amendments act of 1988. ppl susquehanna is protected against this liability by a combination of commercial insurance and an industry assessment program. in the event of a nuclear incident at any of the reactors covered by the price anderson amendments act of 1988, ppl susquehanna could be assessed up to $176 million per incident, payable at $20 million per year. environmental matters air the clean air act deals, in part, with acid rain, attainment of federal ambient ozone standards and toxic air emissions in the u.s. ppl subsidiaries are in substantial compliance with the clean air act. the bush administration and certain members of congress have made proposals regarding possible amendments to the clean air act. these amendments could require significant further reductions in no x , so 2 and mercury and could possibly require measures to limit co 2 . the pennsylvania dep has finalized regulations requiring further seasonal (may-june) no x reductions to 80% from 1990 levels starting in 2003. these further reductions are based on the requirements of the northeast ozone transport region memorandum of understanding and two epa ambient ozone initiatives: the september 1998 epa state implementation plan (sip) call (i.e., epa's requirement for states to revise their sips) issued under section 110 of the clean air act, requiring reductions from 22 eastern states, including pennsylvania; and the epa's approval of petitions filed by northeastern states, requiring reductions from sources in 12 northeastern states and washington d.c., including ppl sources. the epa's sip-call was substantially upheld by the d.c. circuit court of appeals in an appeals proceeding. although the court extended the implementation deadline to may 2004, the pennsylvania dep has not changed its rules accordingly. ppl expects to achieve the 2003 no x reductions with the recent installation of scr technology on the montour units and the possible use of scr or sncr technology on a brunner island unit. the epa has also developed new standards for ambient levels of ozone and fine particulates in the u.s. these standards were challenged and remanded to the epa by the d.c. circuit court of appeals in 1999. however, on appeal to the united states supreme court, the d. c. circuit court's decision was reversed in part and remanded to the d.c. circuit. the new particulates standard, if finalized, may require further reductions in so 2 for certain ppl subsidiaries and year-round no x reductions commencing in 2010-2012 at sip-call levels in pennsylvania, and at slightly less stringent levels in montana. the revised ozone standard, if finalized, is not expected to have a material effect on facilities of ppl subsidiaries. under the clean air act, the epa has been studying the health effects of hazardous air emissions from power plants and other sources in order to determine what emissions should be regulated, and has determined that mercury emissions must be regulated. in this regard, epa is expected to develop regulations by 2004. in 1999, the epa initiated enforcement actions against several utilities, asserting that older, coal-fired power plants operated by those utilities have, over the years, been modified in ways that subject them to more stringent "new source" requirements under the clean air act. the epa has since issued notices of violation and commenced enforcement activities against other utilities. although the epa has threatened to continue expanding its enforcement actions, the future direction of the "new source" requirements is presently unclear. therefore, at this time, ppl is unable to predict whether such epa enforcement actions will be brought with respect to any of its affiliates' plants. however, the epa regional offices that regulate plants in pennsylvania (region iii) and montana (region viii) have indicated an intention to issue information requests to all utilities in their jurisdiction, and the region viii office has issued such a request to ppl montana's corette plant. ppl has responded to the information request. ppl cannot presently predict what, if any, action the epa might take in this regard. should the epa or any state initiate one or more enforcement actions against ppl, compliance with any such enforcement actions could result in additional capital and operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but which could be significant. the epa is also proposing to revise its regulations in a way that will require power plants to meet "new source" performance standards and/or undergo "new source" review for many maintenance and repair activities that are currently exempt. the new jersey dep and some new jersey residents have raised environmental concerns with respect to the martins creek plant, particularly with respect to so 2 emissions. ppl martins creek is discussing these concerns with the new jersey dep. in addition, the plant experienced several opacity violations in the first and second quarters of 2001, for which it paid a civil penalty of $30,300 and funded an environmental project for $90,000. the cost of addressing new jersey's so 2 concerns and the opacity issued is not now determinable but could be significant. see note 11 for information on the lower mt. bethel appeal by the new jersey dep. water/waste the final npdes permit for the montour plant contains stringent limits for iron discharges. the results of a toxic reduction study show that additional water treatment facilities or operational changes are needed at this station. a plan for these changes has been developed and was submitted to the pennsylvania dep in august 2001. a final npdes permit has been issued to the brunner island plant. the permit contains a provision requiring further studies on the thermal impact of the cooling water discharge from the plant. depending on the outcome of these studies, the plant could be subject to capital and operating costs that are not now determinable but could be significant. the epa has significantly tightened the water quality standard for arsenic. the lowered standard may require ppl generation to further treat wastewater and/or take abatement action at several of its subsidiaries' power plants, the cost of which is not now determinable but which could be significant. the epa recently finalized requirements for new or modified water intake structures. these requirements will affect where generating facilities are built, will establish intake design standards, and could lead to requirements for cooling towers at new and modified power plants. another new rule, expected to be finalized in 2003, will address existing structures. each of these rules could impose significant costs on ppl generation, which are not now determinable but which could be significant. capital expenditures through the year 2003 to correct groundwater degradation at fossil-fueled generating stations and to address wastewater control at ppl generation's facilities, are included in the table of construction expenditures in the section entitled "financial condition - capital expenditure requirements" in the review of the financial condition and results of operations. additional capital expenditures could be required beyond the year 2006 in amounts which are not now determinable but which could be significant. actions taken to correct groundwater degradation, to comply with the environmental regulations and to address wastewater control, are also expected to result in increased operating costs in amounts which are not now determinable but which could be significant. superfund and other remediation in 1995, ppl electric entered into a consent order with the pennsylvania dep to address a number of sites where it may be liable for remediation. this may include potential pcb contamination at certain ppl electric substations and pole sites; potential contamination at a number of coal gas manufacturing facilities formerly owned or operated by ppl electric; and oil or other contamination which may exist at some of ppl electric's former generating facilities. in connection with the july 1, 2000 corporate realignment, ppl electric's generation facilities were transferred to subsidiaries of ppl generation. as of december 31, 2001, work has been completed on approximately 80% of the sites included in the consent order. in 1996, ppl gas utilities entered into a similar consent order with the pennsylvania dep to address a number of sites where subsidiaries of ppl gas utilities may be liable for remediation. the sites primarily include former coal gas manufacturing facilities. subsidiaries of ppl gas utilities are also investigating the potential for any mercury contamination from gas meters and regulators. accordingly, ppl gas utilities and pennsylvania dep have agreed to add 72 meter/regulation sites to the consent order. at december 31, 2001, ppl electric and ppl gas utilities had accrued approximately $5 million and $12 million, representing the estimated amounts they will have to spend for site remediation, including those sites covered by each company's consent orders mentioned above. in october 1999, the montana supreme court held in favor of several citizens' groups that the right to a clean and healthful environment is a fundamental right guaranteed by the montana constitution. the court's ruling could result in significantly more stringent environmental laws and regulations, as well as an increase in citizens' suits under montana's environmental laws. the effect on ppl montana of any such changes in laws or regulations or any such increase in legal actions is not currently determinable, but it could be significant. under the montana power asset purchase agreement, ppl montana is indemnified by montana power for any pre-acquisition environmental liabilities. however, this indemnification is conditioned on certain circumstances that can result in ppl montana and montana power sharing in certain costs within limits set forth in the agreement. future cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at sites not currently identified, may result in material additional operating costs for ppl subsidiaries that cannot be estimated at this time. general certain of ppl's affiliates have electric distribution operations in the u.k. and latin america. ppl believes that these operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and government regulations to protect the environment. ppl is not aware of any material administrative proceeding against these companies with respect to any environmental matter. due to the environmental issues discussed above or other environmental matters, ppl subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies or courts. in this regard, ppl subsidiaries also may incur capital expenditures, operating expenses and other costs in amounts which are not now determinable but which could be significant. credit support ppl and ppl energy supply provide certain guarantees for their subsidiaries. ppl has guaranteed all of the debt of ppl capital funding. as of december 31, 2001, ppl had guaranteed $1.3 billion of ppl capital funding medium-term notes. ppl had also guaranteed certain obligations under power purchase and sales agreements of ppl energyplus for up to $1 billion and of ppl montana for up to $138 million. as of december 31, 2001, there were $31 million of guarantees outstanding under the power purchase agreement and none under the sales agreement. in addition, ppl had guaranteed certain obligations of other subsidiaries, totaling $272 million at december 31, 2001. as of december 31, 2001, ppl energy supply has also guaranteed certain obligations under power purchase and sales agreements of ppl energyplus for up to $121 million and certain obligations of other subsidiaries totaling $600 million. source of labor supply as of december 31, 2001, ppl and its subsidiaries had 12,496 full-time employees. this included 3,594 in ppl electric and 425 in ppl gas utilities, 2,550 in ppl generation, 1,943 in ppl energyplus, 44 in ppl global, 2,765 in several central and south american electric companies controlled by ppl global and 1,175 in ppl services. approximately 54%, or 5,243, of ppl's domestic workforce are members of labor unions, with four ibew locals representing nearly 4,200 employees. the other unions primarily represent small locals of gas utility employees in pennsylvania. the bargaining agreement with the largest union was negotiated in 1998 and expires in may 2002. eight new three-year contracts with smaller gas utility locals in pennsylvania were negotiated in 2000 and five additional agreements with two-year terms were negotiated in 2001. new contracts were also concluded with two ibew locals in montana. ppl montana is currently negotiating with the teamsters union for a new agreement. related party transactions ppl global provided temporary financing to wpdl and wpd 1953 in connection with the acquisition of hyder. the outstanding loan receivables and accrued interest, 154.5 million british pounds sterling (approximately $220 million), were repaid in may 2001. at december 31, 2000, ppl global had a $135 million note payable to an affiliate of wpd 1953. the note was denominated in u.s. dollars, and provided for interest at market rates. ppl global repaid this note in january 2001. new accounting standards sfas 141 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 141, "business combinations," which eliminates the pooling-of-interest method of accounting for business combinations and requires the use of the purchase method. in addition, sfas 141 requires the reassessment of intangible assets to determine if they are appropriately classified either separately or within goodwill. sfas 141 is effective for business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001. ppl adopted sfas 141 on july 1, 2001, with no material impact on the financial statements. sfas 142 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 142, "goodwill and other intangible assets , " which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite economic useful lives. sfas 142 requires an annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization. ppl adopted sfas 142 on january 1, 2002. in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142, ppl ceased amortization of goodwill and all intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. the elimination of amortization will result in $18 million less expense (pre-tax) in 2002. in addition, ppl is in the process of conducting the transition impairment analysis and may record a goodwill impairment of up to $100 million (pre-tax) as a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002. the potential impairment relates to reporting units within the international segment. sfas 143 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 143, "accounting for asset retirement obligations," on the accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. sfas 143 requires a liability to be recognized in the financial statements for retirement obligations meeting specific criteria. measurement of the initial obligation is to approximate fair value, with an equivalent amount recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset. the asset will be depreciated in accordance with normal depreciation policy and the liability will be increased, with a charge to the income statement, until the obligation is settled. sfas 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15, 2002. the potential impact of adopting sfas 143 is not yet determinable, but may be material. sfas 144 in august 2001, the fasb issued sfas 144, "accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets," that replaces sfas 121, "accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of." for long-lived assets to be held and used, sfas 144 retains the requirements of sfas 121 to (a) recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows and (b) measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. for long-lived assets to be disposed of, sfas 144 establishes a single accounting model based on the framework established in sfas 121. the accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long-lived assets, including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no. 30, "reporting the results of operations - reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business, and extraordinary, unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions," for the disposal of segments of a business. sfas 144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations. ppl adopted sfas 144 on january 1, 2002, with no material impact on the financial statements. derivative instruments and hedging activities ppl adopted sfas 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities," on january 1, 2001. upon adoption and in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas 133, ppl recorded a cumulative-effect credit of $11 million in earnings, included as an increase to "wholesale energy market and trading" revenues and a decrease to "energy purchases" on the statement of income. ppl also recorded a cumulative-effect charge of $182 million in "accumulated other comprehensive income," a component of shareowners' common equity. as of december 31, 2001, the balance in "accumulated other comprehensive income" related to unrealized gains and losses on qualifying derivatives was a net gain of $23 million, as a result of reclassifying part of the transition adjustment into earnings, changes in market prices and the adoption of dig issue c15 (see discussion in "implementation issues" below). management of market risk exposures ppl's market risk exposure is the adverse effect on the value of a transaction that results from a change in commodity prices, interest rates or currency exchange rates. the market risk associated with commodity price, interest rate and foreign exchange contracts is managed by the establishment and monitoring of parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. ppl actively manages the market risk inherent in its commodity, debt and foreign currency positions. the ppl board of directors has adopted risk management policies to manage the risk exposures related to energy prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. these policies monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and use derivative instruments to manage some associated commodity, debt, and foreign currency activities. ppl's derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of the rmc. the rmc is composed of the chief financial officer and other officers of ppl. the rmc reports to the finance committee of the ppl board of directors on the scope of its derivative activities. the rmc sets forth risk-management philosophy and objectives through a corporate policy, provides guidelines for derivative-instrument usage, and establishes procedures for control and valuation, counterparty credit approval and the monitoring and reporting of derivative activity. ppl utilizes forward contracts, futures contracts, options and swaps as part of its risk management strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency volatility. all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, unless they meet sfas 133 criteria for exclusion (see discussion in "implementation issues" below). fair value hedges ppl enters into financial contracts to hedge a portion of the fair value of firm commitments of forward electricity sales and to hedge fluctuations in market value of existing debt issuances. these contracts range in maturity through 2006. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001, ppl recognized a net gain of $7 million, after-tax, resulting from firm commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges (reported in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues and "energy purchases" on the statement of income). ppl did not recognize any gains or losses from the ineffective portion of fair value hedges. cash flow hedges ppl enters into physical and financial contracts, including forwards, futures and swaps, to hedge the price risk associated with electric, gas and oil commodities. additionally, ppl enters into financial interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest expense associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. these contracts and swaps range in maturity through 2004. ppl also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge exchange rates associated with firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge the net investment of foreign operations. these forward contracts range in maturity through 2003, excluding those contracts forecasted to relate to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001, ppl recorded a net gain of $23 million in "accumulated other comprehensive income" relating to these contracts. as a result of an unplanned outage, enron's bankruptcy and changes in other economic conditions, ppl discontinued certain cash flow hedges which resulted in a net loss of $14 million, after-tax, for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001 (reported in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues and "energy purchases" on the statement of income). the impact on the financial statements resulting from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001 was immaterial. as of december 31, 2001, the deferred net gain on derivative instruments in "accumulated other comprehensive income" expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months was $6 million. implementation issues on june 29, 2001, the fasb issued definitive guidance on dig issue c15: "scope exceptions: normal purchases and normal sales exception for option-type contracts and forward contracts in electricity." issue c15 provides additional guidance on the classification and application of sfas 133 relating to purchases and sales of electricity utilizing forward contracts and options. this guidance became effective as of july 1, 2001. in december 2001, the fasb revised the guidance in issue c15, principally related to the eligibility of options for the normal purchases and normal sales exception. the revised guidance is effective as of january 1, 2002. purchases and sales of forward electricity and option contracts that require physical delivery and which are expected to be used or sold by the reporting entity in the normal course of business would generally be considered "normal purchases and normal sales" under sfas 133. these transactions, while within the scope of sfas 133, are not required to be marked to fair value in the financial statements because they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception. as of december 31, 2001, "accumulated other comprehensive income" included a net gain of $11 million related to forward transactions classified as cash flow hedges prior to adoption of dig issue c15. this gain will be reversed from "accumulated other comprehensive income" and recognized in earnings as the contracts deliver through 2008. unrealized gains/(losses) on qualifying derivatives (millions of dollars) (after-tax) december 31, 2001 cumulative unrealized gain on qualifying derivatives, beginning of period: $ 0 unrealized gains (losses) arising during period: cumulative effect of change in accounting principle at january 1, 2001 (182 ) net reclassification into earnings (16 ) net change associated with current period hedging transactions 221 unrealized gain on qualifying derivatives 23 cumulative unrealized gain on qualifying derivatives, end of period $ 23 credit concentration ppl enters into contracts with many entities for the purchase and sale of energy. most of these contracts are considered a normal part of doing business and, as such, the mark-to-market value of these contracts is not reflected in the financial statements. however, the mark-to-market value of these contracts is considered when committing to new business from a credit perspective. at year-end, ppl had a credit exposure of $412 million to energy trading partners. the majority of this amount was the mark-to-market value of multi-year contracts for energy sales. therefore, if the counterparties fail to perform their obligations, ppl would not experience an immediate financial loss, but would experience lower revenues in future years to the extent that replacement sales could not be made at the same prices as the defaulted contracts. of the $412 million, four counterparties account for 81% of the exposure. no other individual counterparty accounted for more than 3% of the exposure. each of the four primary counterparties has an "investment grade" credit rating with standard &amp; poor's, with the exception of one counterparty that is a governmental agency and, as such, is not rated. with the exception of the government agency, ppl has the right to request collateral from each of these counterparties in the event their credit rating falls below investment grade. it is also ppl's policy to enter into netting agreements with all of its counterparties to minimize credit exposure. sales to california independent system operator and to other pacific northwest purchasers through subsidiaries, ppl has made approximately $18 million of sales to the california iso, for which ppl has not yet been paid in full. given the myriad of electricity supply problems presently faced by the california electric utilities and the california iso, ppl cannot predict whether or when it will receive payment. as of december 31, 2001, ppl has fully reserved for possible underrecoveries of payments for these sales. litigation arising out of the california electricity supply situation has been filed at the ferc and in california courts against sellers of energy to the california iso. the plaintiffs and intervenors in these proceedings allege abuses of market power, manipulation of market prices, unfair trade practices and violations of state antitrust laws, among other things, and seek price caps on wholesale sales in california and other western power markets, refunds of excess profits allegedly earned on these sales of energy, and other relief, including treble damages and attorneys' fees. certain of ppl's subsidiaries have intervened in the ferc proceedings in order to protect their interests, but have not been named as defendants in any of the court actions alleging abuses of market power, manipulation of market prices, unfair trade practices and violations of state antitrust laws. a ppl subsidiary has been named as a defendant in a declaratory judgment action initiated by the state of california to prevent certain members of the california power exchange from seeking compensation for the state's seizure of certain energy contracts. ppl montana is a member of the california power exchange, but it has no energy contracts with or through the california power exchange and has not sought compensation in connection with the state's seizure. attorneys general in several western states, including california, have begun investigations related to the electricity supply situation in california and other western states. the ferc has determined that all sellers of energy in the california markets, including ppl montana, should be subject to refund liability for the period beginning october 2, 2000 through june 20, 2001 and has initiated an evidentiary hearing concerning refund amounts. the ferc also is considering whether to order refunds for sales made in the pacific northwest, including sales made by ppl montana. the ferc administrative law judge assigned to this proceeding has recommended that no refunds be ordered for sales into the pacific northwest. the ferc presently is considering this recommendation. ppl cannot predict whether or the extent to which any of its subsidiaries will be the target of any governmental investigation or named in these lawsuits, refund proceedings or other lawsuits, the outcome of any such proceedings or whether the ultimate impact on ppl of the electricity supply situation in california and other western states will be material. enron bankruptcy in connection with the december 2, 2001 bankruptcy filings by enron corporation and its affiliates ("enron"), certain ppl subsidiaries have terminated certain electricity and gas agreements with enron. ppl and its subsidiaries' 2001 earnings reflect a loss associated with termination of these contracts of $8 million after-tax, which is recorded in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" and "energy purchases" on the statement of income. additionally, certain of these contracts with enron extended through 2006, and were at prices more favorable to ppl than current market prices. however, there is no further accounting charge to be recorded. ppl expects to make a claim in enron's bankruptcy proceeding with respect to all amounts payable by enron resulting from the termination of these contracts. write-down of international energy projects ppl global has a 51% economic interest in wpd 1953, a 15.4% equity investor in teesside power limited, the owner of the 1,875 mw teesside power station, located in northeast england. through its european affiliates, enron was an owner, operator and power purchaser of the station's output. as a result of enron being placed into receivership in the u.k. and its default on obligations under the power purchase agreements, wpd 1953 wrote off its entire equity investment in teesside power limited. ppl global's share of the impairment loss was $21 million and is included in "write-down of international energy projects," a component of "other charges" on the statement of income. in connection with the enron bankruptcy and the probable resulting loss of teesside cash flows, ppl and its subsidiaries evaluated the carrying value of the investment in wpd 1953 and wpdl. fair value, measured using discounted cash flows, was compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment existed at december 31, 2001. fair value was determined considering the loss of the value of the future cash flows from the teesside power station and a forecasted reduction in future operating cash flows at wpd 1953 and wpdl. the probability-weighted impairment loss was $117 million, after-tax. the pre-tax charge was $134 million, and was recorded as a charge to "write-down of international energy projects." ppl global owns 89.6% of cemar, which distributes and sells electricity in brazil, under a 30-year concession agreement with the government. the combined effects of growth in demand, decreased rainfall on the country's heavily hydroelectric-dependent generating capacity and delays in the development of new non-hydroelectric generation have led to shortages of electricity in certain regions. as a result, the brazilian government implemented countrywide electricity rationing in mid-2001. in addition, the wholesale energy markets in brazil have been substantially disrupted. cemar's results of operations, its cash flows, and its continued ability to meet its financial obligations have deteriorated due to the continuing impact of the electricity rationing, the disruption in the energy markets, the failure of the electricity regulator to adequately address these problems, the resulting effects on the brazilian capital markets and related factors. in december 2001 and january 2002, the brazilian electricity regulator issued tariff rulings that cemar believes are inadequate to compensate for cemar's rationing-related losses and to meet its ongoing operational and financial requirements. moreover, cemar believes that these tariff rulings demonstrate that the regulator may not take the necessary steps to resolve the current problems in a satisfactory manner. in addition, the brazilian wholesale energy markets continue to be disrupted and recent actions by the electricity regulator indicate that adequate compensation to cemar for its transactions in that market may not be made. finally, the continued problems in the brazilian energy market and the lack of appropriate regulatory actions have significantly decreased the availability of local financing for cemar. as a result of the above events, ppl global estimates that the long-term viability of the cemar operation is jeopardized and that there is minimal probability of positive future cash flows. consequently, at december 31, 2001, ppl global recorded an impairment loss in the carrying value of its net assets in cemar of $179 million, reflected in "write-down of international energy projects." in addition, cemar increased its valuation allowance in deferred tax assets, thereby recording $44 million in additional foreign deferred income taxes. a related $6 million credit to "minority interest" was also reflected on the statement of income. the net result of these transactions was a $217 million charge to earnings. ppl global currently anticipates writing off the remaining portion of its cemar investment, approximately $100 million, in 2002. as a result of the financial difficulties discussed above, cemar has failed to pay certain of its creditors for obligations when due. cemar is currently in discussions with credits, governmental officials, regulators and other parties to address these problems. in addition, cemar expects that it will not be in compliance with the financial covenants in its $150 million debenture indenture when it closes its books for the quarter ended december 31, 2001. in that case, cemar will be required to notify the indenture agent. in accordance with the indenture, the agent will call a meeting of the holders of the debentures within three business days of the notice to hold a vote regarding the acceleration of the debentures. unless three-fourths of the holders vote against acceleration, the agent will be obligated under the indenture to accelerate the debentures. cemar expects the required notice to the indenture agent to occur in the first quarter of 2002. strategic initiative in august 2001, ppl completed a strategic initiative to confirm the structural separation of ppl electric from ppl and ppl's other affiliated companies. this initiative enabled ppl electric to reduce business risk by securing a supply contract adequate to meet its plr obligations, enabled ppl energyplus to lock in an electric supply agreement at current favorable prices, and enabled ppl to raise capital at attractive rates for its unregulated businesses, while allowing ppl to retain valuable advantages related to operating both energy supply and energy delivery businesses. in connection with this initiative, ppl electric: obtained a long-term electric supply contract to meet its plr obligations, at prices generally equal to the pre-determined "capped" rates it is authorized to charge its plr customers from 2002 through 2009 under the 1998 puc settlement order; agreed to limit its businesses to electric transmission and distribution and activities relating to or arising out of those businesses; adopted amendments to its articles of incorporation and bylaws containing corporate governance and operating provisions designed to reinforce its corporate separateness from affiliated companies; appointed an independent director to its board of directors and required the unanimous consent of the board of directors, including the consent of the independent director, to amendments to these corporate governance and operating provisions or to the commencement of any insolvency proceeding, including any filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or other similar actions; appointed an independent compliance administrator to review, on a semi-annual basis, its compliance with the new corporate governance and operating requirements contained in its amended articles of incorporation and bylaws; and adopted a plan of division pursuant to the pennsylvania business corporation law. the plan of division resulted in two separate corporations. ppl electric was the surviving corporation and a new pennsylvania corporation was created. under the plan of division, $5 million of cash and certain of ppl electric's potential liabilities were allocated to the new corporation. ppl has guaranteed the obligations of the new corporation with respect to such liabilities. the enhancements to ppl electric's legal separation from its affiliates are intended to minimize the risk that a court would order ppl electric's assets and liabilities to be substantively consolidated with those of ppl or another affiliate of ppl in the event that ppl or another ppl affiliate were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case. at a special meeting of ppl electric's shareowners held on july 17, 2001, the plan of division and the amendments to ppl electric's articles of incorporation and bylaws were approved, and became effective upon filing the articles of division and the plan of division with the secretary of state of the commonwealth of pennsylvania. this filing was made in august 2001. as part of the strategic initiative, ppl electric solicited bids to contract with energy suppliers to meet its obligation to deliver energy to its customers from 2002 through 2009. in june 2001, ppl electric announced that ppl energyplus was the low bidder, among six bids examined, and was selected to provide the energy supply requirements of ppl electric from 2002 through 2009. under this contract, ppl energyplus will provide electricity at pre-determined capped prices that ppl electric is authorized to charge its plr customers, and received a $90 million payment to offset differences between the revenues expected under the capped prices and projected market prices through the life of the supply agreement (as projected by ppl energyplus at the time of its bid). the contract resulted in ppl energyplus having an eight-year contract at current market prices. ppl has guaranteed the obligations of ppl energyplus under the new contract. in july 2001, the energy supply contract was approved by the puc and accepted for filing by the ferc. also in july 2001, ppl electric filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to issue up to $900 million in debt. in august 2001, ppl electric sold $800 million of senior secured bonds under this registration statement. the offering consisted of two series of bonds: $300 million of 5-7/8% series due 2007 and $500 million of 6-1/4% series due 2009. ppl electric used a portion of the proceeds from these debt issuances to make the $90 million up-front payment to ppl energyplus, and $280 million was used to repurchase a portion of its common stock from ppl. the remainder of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. taken collectively, the steps in the strategic initiative are intended to protect the customers of ppl electric from volatile energy prices and facilitate a significant increase in leverage at ppl electric, while lowering its cost of capital. ppl's shareowners also benefited from this initiative because it provided low-cost capital to the higher-growth, unregulated side of ppl's business. schedule ii -

market risk market risk sensitive instruments ppl energy supply actively manages the market risk inherent in its commodity, debt, and foreign currency and equity positions as detailed in note 18 to the financial statements. ppl energy supply has a comprehensive risk management policy to manage the risk exposures related to counterparty credit, energy prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. an rmc comprised of senior officers of ppl oversees the risk management function. nonetheless, adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices may result in losses in earnings, cash flows and/or fair values. the forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions, due to reliance on model assumptions. actual future results may differ materially from those presented. these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible losses. commodity price risk ppl energy supply uses various methodologies to simulate forward price curves in the energy markets to estimate the size and probability of changes in market value resulting from commodity price movements. the methodologies require several key assumptions, including selection of confidence levels, the holding period of the commodity positions, and the depth and applicability to future periods of historical commodity price information. as of december 31, 2001, ppl energy supply estimated that a 10% adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of its non-hedge portfolio by an insignificant amount, as compared to $6 million at december 31, 2000. a similar adverse movement in market prices would have decreased the value of its hedge portfolio by approximately $8 million, as compared to $292 million at december 31, 2000. however, the change in the value of the hedge portfolio would have been offset by an increase in the value of the underlying commodity, the electricity generated. the decline in forward prices from 2000 is the primary reason for the differences between the 2001 and the 2000 sensitivity analyses. in addition to commodity price risk, ppl energy supply's commodity positions are also subject to operational and event risks including, among others, increases in load demand and forced outages at power plants. ppl energy supply's risk management program is designed to manage the risks associated with market fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas, oil and emission allowances. ppl energy supply's risk management policy and programs include risk identification and risk limits management, with measurement and controls for real-time monitoring. ppl energy supply has entered into forward, option, and tolling contracts that require physical delivery of the commodity, as well as futures, exchange-for-physical transactions and other financial contracts (such as swap agreements where settlement is generally based on the difference between a fixed price and an index-based price for the underlying commodity). ppl energy supply expects the use of these contracts to be ongoing. ppl energy supply enters into contracts to hedge the impact of market fluctuations on ppl energy supply's energy-related assets, liabilities and other contractual obligations. ppl energy supply also executes these contracts to take advantage of market opportunities. as a result, ppl energy supply may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated. commodity price risk - plr contract currently, ppl electric and ppl energyplus have a power supply agreement under which ppl energyplus sells to ppl electric (under a predetermined pricing arrangement) energy, capacity, and ancillary services to fulfill ppl electric's plr obligation through 2001. ppl energyplus also has contracted to supply ppl electric with long-term power for the period 2002 through 2009. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information. as a result, ppl electric has shifted any electric price risk relating to its plr obligation to ppl energyplus for 2001 through 2009. interest rate risk ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations. ppl manages interest rate risk for ppl energy supply by using financial derivative products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating-rate interest rates in its debt portfolios, adjusting the duration of its debt portfolios and locking in u.s. treasury rates (and interest rate spreads over treasuries) in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and losses in the fair value of ppl energy supply's debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates. at december 31, 2001, ppl energy supply's potential annual exposure to increased interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was estimated at $4 million. ppl energy supply is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its debt portfolio. at december 31, 2001, ppl estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its debt portfolio, through a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, was $2 million, as compared to $1 million at december 31, 2000. ppl utilizes various risk management instruments to reduce ppl energy supply's exposure to adverse interest rate movements for future anticipated financings. while ppl energy supply is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments, they are designed such that any economic loss in value should be offset by interest rate savings at the time the future anticipated financing is completed. at december 31, 2001, and december 31, 2000, ppl energy supply had not entered into any such instruments. see notes 7 and 18 to the financial statements for a discussion of financial derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2001. foreign currency risk ppl is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through investments in affiliates in latin america and europe. in addition, ppl may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than u.s. dollars. ppl has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities and net investments. during the first quarter of 2001, ppl entered into contracts for the forward purchase of 51 million euros to pay for certain equipment in 2002 and 2003. the estimated value of these forward purchases as of december 31, 2001, being the amount ppl would have to pay to terminate them, was $3 million. at december 31, 2000, ppl had a forward purchase contract for 37 million euros. the estimated amount that ppl would have had to pay to terminate the forward purchases was insignificant. nuclear decommissioning fund - securities price risk in order to meet nrc requirements, ppl susquehanna maintains trust funds to fund certain costs of decommissioning the susquehanna station. as of december 31, 2001, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities and are reflected at fair value on ppl energy supply's balance sheet. the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund susquehanna's decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. however, the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets, and the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. ppl susquehanna actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement. at december 31, 2001, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated $17 million reduction in the fair value of the assets, as compared to an $18 million reduction at december 31, 2000. ppl electric's 1998 restructuring settlement agreement provides for the collection of authorized nuclear decommissioning costs through the ctc. additionally, ppl electric is permitted to seek recovery from customers of up to 96% of any increases in these costs. under the power supply agreement between ppl electric and ppl energyplus, these revenues are passed on to ppl energyplus. similarly, these revenues are passed on to ppl susquehanna under a power supply agreement between ppl energyplus and ppl susquehanna. therefore, ppl energy supply's securities price risk is expected to remain insignificant. report of independent accountants to the board of managers and sole member of ppl energy supply, llc: in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under item 14(a)(1) on page 176 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ppl energy supply, llc and its subsidiaries ("ppl energy supply") at december 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 14(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. these financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of ppl energy supply's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the united states of america, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, ppl energy supply changed its method of accounting for derivative and hedging activities pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no. 138, accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities (an amendment of fasb statement 133). ppl energy supply also changed its method of accounting for amortizing unrecognized gains or losses in the annual pension expense/income determined under statement of financial accounting standards no.

management's report on responsibility for financial statements the management of ppl energy supply is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the consolidated financial statements and all other sections of this annual report. the financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in preparing the financial statements, management makes informed estimates and judgments of the expected effects of events and transactions based upon currently available facts and circumstances. management believes that the financial statements are free of material misstatement and present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of ppl energy supply. ppl energy supply's consolidated financial statements have been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp (pwc), independent certified public accountants. pwc's appointment as auditors was previously ratified by the shareowners of ppl. management has made available to pwc all ppl energy supply's financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of board of managers' meetings. management believes that all representations made to pwc during its audit were valid and appropriate. ppl energy supply maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance as to the integrity and reliability of the financial statements, the protection of assets from unauthorized use or disposition and the prevention and detection of fraudulent financial reporting. the concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a system of internal control should not exceed the benefits derived and that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control. fundamental to the control system is the selection and training of qualified personnel, an organizational structure that provides appropriate segregation of duties, the utilization of written policies and procedures and the continual monitoring of the system for compliance. in addition, ppl maintains an internal auditing program to evaluate ppl energy supply's system of internal control for adequacy, application and compliance. management considers the internal auditors' and pwc's recommendations concerning its system of internal control and has taken actions which are believed to be cost-effective in the circumstances to respond appropriately to these recommendations. management believes that ppl energy supply's system of internal control is adequate to accomplish the objectives discussed in this report. the board of managers, acting through ppl's audit committee, oversees management's responsibilities in the preparation of the financial statements. in performing this function, the audit committee, which is composed of four independent directors, meets periodically with management, the internal auditors and pwc to review the work of each. pwc and the internal auditors have free access to ppl's audit committee and to the board of managers, without management present, to discuss internal accounting control, auditing and financial reporting matters. management also recognizes its responsibility for fostering a strong ethical climate so that ppl energy supply's affairs are conducted according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. this responsibility is characterized and reflected in the business policies and guidelines of ppl energy supply's operating subsidiaries. these policies and guidelines address: the necessity of ensuring open communication within ppl energy supply; potential conflicts of interest; proper procurement activities; compliance with all applicable laws, including those relating to financial disclosure; and the confidentiality of proprietary information. william f. hecht president john r. biggar vice president item 8. financial statements and supplementary data consolidated

(see note 21.) the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of the financial statements. ppl energy supply, llc notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies and basis of presentation business ppl energy supply is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ppl. ppl energy supply was formed as a subsidiary of ppl energy funding in november 2000 to engage in competitive energy businesses. in may 2001, ppl energy funding contributed its interests in ppl generation, ppl energyplus and ppl global to ppl energy supply, after receipt of required regulatory approvals. as a result, ppl energy supply is now the parent of ppl generation, ppl energyplus, ppl global and ppl investment corporation. ppl energy funding is the sole member of ppl energy supply. the principal business of ppl generation is owning and operating u.s. generating facilities through various subsidiaries. the principal business of ppl energyplus is unregulated wholesale and retail energy marketing. ppl global's principal businesses are the acquisition and development of both u.s. and international energy projects, and the ownership and operation of international energy projects. ppl investment corporation makes loans to subsidiaries of ppl energy supply and affiliates of ppl. predecessor businesses and basis of presentation the sec requires financial information of a registrant's predecessors for all periods prior to a registrant's existence. the following business and asset acquisitions were identified as predecessors to ppl energy supply: 1950 - realty company of pennsylvania 1960 - lady jane collieries, inc. 1968 - pennsylvania mines, llc 1975 - greene manor coal company 1976 - ppl interstate energy company 1977 - bdw corporation 1995 - ppl global, llc; ppl spectrum, inc. 1998 - ppl energyplus, llc; h. t. lyons, inc.; mcclure company 1999 - generation assets acquired from montana power (forming ppl montana, llc); ppl rights, inc.; burns mechanical, inc.; mccarl's inc.; ppl energy services northeast, inc. (formerly western mass. holdings, inc.); ppl synfuel investments, llc; ppl somerset, llc; ppl maine, llc 2000 - clymer fuel, llc; generation assets transferred by ppl electric utilities in the july 1, 2000 corporate realignment (formed as subsidiaries of ppl generation, llc. see note 16). since acquisition or formation, each entity identified above remained a wholly-owned subsidiary of ppl or its subsidiaries. therefore, the entities listed above have been combined as one collective predecessor for purposes of satisfying sec financial statement requirements, based on their respective acquisition or formation dates. in the balance of these notes, "ppl energy supply" refers to the predecessors of ppl energy supply as presented above. certain line items in these ppl energy supply financial statements may not be consistent with the financial statements previously issued in connection with the securities act of 1934 filing requirements of ppl, due to reclassifications, as well as eliminations at different levels of consolidation. consolidation ppl energy supply consolidates the financial statements of its affiliates when it has control. all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. minority interests in operating results and equity ownership are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. the consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of all controlled affiliates on a current basis, with the exception of certain ppl global investments. it is the policy of ppl global to consolidate foreign affiliates and record equity in earnings of affiliates on a lag, based on the availability of financial data on a u.s. gaap basis: equity earnings from wpd 1953, the parent of wpd (south west) and wpd (south wales), and wpdl are recorded on a one-month lag. ppl global has 51% equity ownership interests in these entities but has joint control of these investments with mirant. earnings from all other foreign equity method investments are recorded on a three-month lag. ppl global consolidates the results of controlled subsidiaries, emel, ec, the bolivian subsidiaries and other investments, on a one-month lag. the results of cemar are consolidated on a three-month lag. the portion of the subsidiaries' earnings owned by outside shareowners is included in "minority interest" in the consolidated financial statements. ppl global's 8.5% investment in cge is accounted for using the cost method. dividends from cge are recorded as income when received. use of estimates/contingencies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. ppl energy supply records loss contingencies in accordance with sfas 5, "accounting for contingencies." property, plant and equipment following are the classes of property, plant and equipment, with the associated accumulated depreciation at december 31 (millions of dollars): 2001 2000 electric plant generation $ 7,208 $ 6,801 transmission and distribution 561 769 nuclear fuel 127 320 construction work in progress 146 226 general 174 149 gas and oil 67 67 other property 96 94 8,379 8,426 less: accumulated depreciation 4,899 5,037 $ 3,480 $ 3,389 property, plant and equipment is recorded at original costs, unless impaired under the provisions of sfas 121, "accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of." original cost includes material, labor, contractor costs, construction overheads and capitalized interest. the cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. when a component of property, plant or equipment is retired that was depreciated under the composite or group method, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. when all or a significant portion of an operating unit is retired or that was depreciated under the composite or group method, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by regulators. depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods. the annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: generation, 5-50 years; transmission and distribution, 30-40 years; and general, 5-58 years. ppl energy supply periodically reviews and adjusts the depreciable lives of its fixed assets. asset impairment long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles held and used by ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. such reviews are performed in accordance with sfas 121. impairment losses on such long-lived assets are recognized when book values exceed expected undiscounted future cash flow with the impairment measured on a discounted future cash flows basis. equity investments are reviewed for impairment in accordance with apb opinion no. 18, "the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock." apb opinion no. 18 provides that "a loss in value of an investment which is other than a temporary decline should be recognized." ppl energy supply identifies and measures loss in value of equity investments based upon a comparison of fair value to carrying value. see note 17 for the impact of sfas 144 on accounting for asset impairments. amortization of goodwill goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed 40 years. the excess cost over the fair value of investments accounted for under the equity method is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period not in excess of 40 years. the unamortized excess cost (goodwill element) is reported in "investment in unconsolidated affiliates - at equity" on the balance sheet. see note 3 for more information. see note 17 for the impact of sfas 142 on accounting for goodwill. accounting for price risk management ppl energy supply enters into commodity contracts for the physical purchase and sale of energy as well as energy contracts that can be settled financially. through ppl, ppl energy supply enters into interest rate derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to changes in the fair value of its debt instruments, as well as its exposure to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing debt instruments or forecasted transactions. through ppl, ppl energy supply also enters into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions or net investments. as of january 1, 2001, contracts that meet the definition of a derivative were accounted for under sfas 133, "accounting for derivative instrument and hedging activities." certain energy contracts have been excluded from sfas 133's requirements because they meet the definition of a "normal sale or purchase" under dig issue c15, "scope exceptions: normal purchases and normal sales exception for certain option-type contracts and forward contracts in electricity." these contracts are reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting. see note 18 for additional information on sfas 133. under sfas 133, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. on the date the derivative contract is executed, ppl energy supply designates the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ("fair value" hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ("cash flow" hedge), a foreign currency fair value or cash flow hedge ("foreign currency" hedge), a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, or a non-hedge derivative. changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as, and is designated and qualifies as, a fair value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current-period earnings. changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as, and is designated as and qualifies as, a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows being hedged. changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as and qualify as, foreign currency hedges are recorded in either current-period earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the hedge transaction is a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. if however, a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustments account within equity. changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings. in addition, ppl energy supply has entered into non-derivative contracts that meet the definition of energy trading activities as defined by eitf 98-10, "accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities." in accordance with eitf 98-10, energy trading contract gains and losses from changes in market prices are marked to market through earnings. for 1999 and 2000, ppl energyplus used eitf 98-10 to account for its commodity forward and financial contracts. as such, contracts that did not meet the definition of energy trading contracts, as defined by eitf 98-10, were reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting. the gains or losses on interest rate derivative contracts that settled prior to the adoption of sfas 133 were deferred and are being recognized over the life of the debt. market gains and losses on foreign currency derivative contracts that settled prior to the adoption of sfas 133 were recognized in accordance with sfas 52, "foreign currency translation," and are included in "foreign currency translation adjustments," a component of member's equity on the balance sheet. gains and losses from changes in market prices of energy sales contracts are accounted for in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues; gains and losses from changes in market prices of energy purchase contracts are accounted for in "energy purchases" on the statement of income. the amortized gains and losses from interest rate derivative contracts are accounted for in "interest expense." revenue recognition "retail electric and gas" and "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues are recorded based on deliveries through the end of the calendar month. unbilled retail revenues result because customers meters are read and bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than all being read at the end of the month. unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kwh by the estimated average cents per kwh. "energy related businesses" revenue includes revenues from ppl global and the mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries. ppl global's revenue reflects its proportionate share of affiliate earnings under the equity method of accounting, as described in the "consolidation" section of note 1, and dividends received from its investments are accounted for using the cost method. the mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries record profits from construction contracts on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. income from time and material contracts is recognized currently as the work is performed. costs include all direct material and labor costs and job-related overhead. provisions for estimated loss on uncompleted contacts, if any, are made in the period in which such losses are determined. income taxes the income tax provision for ppl energy supply is calculated in accordance with sfas 109, "accounting for income taxes." the taxable income or loss is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of ppl. the income tax provision for ppl energy supply is calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing policy which provides that the taxable income be calculated as if ppl energy supply filed a separate return. leases see note 10 for a discussion on accounting for leases. pension and other postretirement benefits see note 12 for a discussion on accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. cash equivalents all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. comprehensive income comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, defined as changes in member's equity from transactions other than with the member. other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and qualifying derivatives, and the excess of additional pension liability over unamortized prior service costs. comprehensive income is reflected on the statement of member's equity and comprehensive income, and "accumulated other comprehensive income" is included in member's equity on the balance sheet. the accumulated other comprehensive income of ppl energy supply at december 31, 2001 and 2000 was $(226) million and $(37) million, respectively. foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of international operations, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated at year-end exchange rates, and related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. adjustments resulting from translation are recorded in other comprehensive income. the effect of translation adjustments on other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, is disclosed in the statement of member's equity and comprehensive income. gains or losses relating to foreign currency transactions are recognized in income currently. the aggregate transaction gain was $8 million in 2001, and was not significant in 2000. project development ppl global expenses the costs of evaluating potential acquisition and development opportunities as incurred. acquisition and development costs are capitalized upon approval of the investment by the ppl global board of managers and the finance committee of ppl's board of directors or, if later, the achievement of sufficient project milestones such that the economic viability of the project is reasonably assured. the level of assurance needed for capitalization of such costs requires that all major uncertainties be resolved and that there is a high probability that the project will proceed as planned, or that such costs will be recoverable through long-term operations, a financing or a sale. the continued capitalization of project development and acquisition costs is subject to on-going risks related to successful completion. in the event that ppl global determines that a particular project is no longer viable, previously capitalized costs are charged to expense in the period that such determination is made. reclassification certain amounts in the 2000 and 1999 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. segment and related information ppl energy supply's reportable segments are supply and international. the supply group consists of the domestic energy marketing, generation and domestic development operations of ppl energy supply. the international group includes ppl global's responsibility for the acquisition, development, ownership and operation of international energy projects. the majority of ppl global's international investments are located in the u.k., chile, el salvador and brazil. segments include direct charges, as well as an allocation of indirect corporate costs, for services provided by ppl services. these service costs include functions such as financial, legal, human resources and information services. see note 15 for discussion of the contract between ppl electric and ppl energyplus. previously reported information has been restated to conform to the current presentation. financial data for ppl energy supply's business segments are as follows (millions of dollars): 2001 2000 1999 income statement data revenues from external

the ppl energy supply level will not be consistent with the supply segment information reported at the ppl level. additional supply segment functions exist at ppl that are outside of ppl energy supply. further, certain income items exist at the ppl energy supply level, but are eliminated at the ppl level. lastly, certain expense items are fully allocated to the segments at the ppl level only. investment in unconsolidated affiliates - at equity ppl energy supply's investment in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method was $586 million and $800 million at december 31, 2001 and 2000. the most significant investment was ppl global's investment in wpd 1953, which was $328 million at december 31, 2001 and $479 million at december 31, 2000. wpd 1953 owns wpd (south west) and wpd (south wales). see note 21 for a discussion on the write-down of international energy projects. at december 31, 2001, ppl global had a 51% equity ownership interest in wpd 1953, but shared joint control with mirant. accordingly, ppl global accounts for its investment in wpd 1953 (and other investments where it has majority ownership but lacks control) under the equity method of accounting. investment in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method at december 31, 2001, and the effective equity ownership percentages, were as follows: ppl global: bolivian generating group, llc - 29.3% latin american energy &amp; electricity fund i, lp - 16.6% aguaytia energy, llc - 11.4% hidrocentrais reunidas, lda - 50.0% hidro iberica, b. v. - 50.0% wpd 1953

the decrease in revenues and net income in 2001 and 2000 from 1999 were in part due to the sale of the supply business of wpd (south west), formerly sweb, in the fourth quarter of 1999. sales to other electric utilities under ferc-approved interconnection and power supply agreements, ppl energyplus supplied capacity and energy to ugi. these agreements were terminated in february 2001. ppl energyplus had a contract to provide bg&amp;e with 129,000 kilowatts, or 6.6%, of ppl susquehanna's share of capacity and related energy from the susquehanna station. ppl energyplus provided 407 million kwh to bg&amp;e through may 2001, at which point the contract ended. ppl montana provided power to montana power under two wholesale transition sales agreements. one agreement expired in december 2001 and the second agreement expires in june 2002. see note 14 for more information regarding a new power supply agreement beginning in july 2002. income and other taxes for 2001, 2000 and 1999 the corporate federal income tax rate was 35%. the statutory corporate net income tax rates for pennsylvania and montana were 9.99% and 6.75%. the tax effects of significant temporary differences comprising ppl energy supply's net deferred income tax asset were as follows (millions of dollars): 2001 2000 deferred tax assets deferred investment tax credits $ 47 $ 52 nug contracts &amp; buybacks

and its 20% to 50% owned corporate joint ventures where management has determined that the earnings are permanently reinvested in the companies that produced them. the cumulative undistributed earnings are included in member's equity on the balance sheet. the amounts considered permanently reinvested at december 31, 2001 and 2000 were $38 million and $27 million. it is not practical to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on these foreign earnings if they were remitted to ppl global. nuclear decommissioning costs the cost to decommission the susquehanna station is based on a site-specific study to dismantle and decommission each unit immediately following final shutdown. ppl susquehanna's 90% share of the total estimated cost of decommissioning the susquehanna station was approximately $724 million in 1993 dollars. this estimate includes decommissioning the radiological portions of the station and the cost of removal of non-radiological structures and materials. decommissioning costs are recorded as a component of depreciation expense. beginning in january 1999, in accordance with the puc final order, $130 million of decommissioning costs are being recovered from customers through the ctc over the 11-year life of the ctc rather than the remaining life of susquehanna. the recovery will include a return on unamortized decommissioning costs. decommissioning charges were $24 million in 2001, and $13 million for the six months ended december 31, 2000. amounts collected from ppl electric's customers for decommissioning, less applicable taxes, are deposited in external trust funds for investment and can be used only for future decommissioning costs. accrued nuclear decommissioning costs were $294 million and $280 million at december 31, 2001 and 2000, and are included in "deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities - other" on the balance sheet. in november 2001, ppl susquehanna notified the nrc that it intends to file for 20-year license renewals for each of the susquehanna units. if approved, the operating licenses would be extended from 2022 to 2042 for unit 1 and from 2024 to 2044 for unit 2. see note 17 for additional information on sfas 143, which could have a material impact on the accounting for the decommissioning of the susquehanna station. financial instruments the carrying amount on the balance sheet and the estimated fair value of ppl energy supply's financial instruments were as follows (millions of dollars): december 31, 2001 december 31, 2000 carrying amount fair value carrying amount

(c) valued using either exchange-traded market quotes or prices obtained through third-party brokers. see note 18 about the various uses of derivative financial instruments at ppl energy supply. (d) these contracts were classified as non-trading under eitf 98-10 and were not required to be marked to fair value on the balance sheet in 2000. this table excludes derivative and non-derivative energy contracts that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument because physical delivery is expected. credit arrangements and financing activities credit arrangements in june 2001, ppl energy supply entered into two credit facilities: a $600 million 364-day facility and a $500 million three-year facility. obligations of ppl energy supply under these credit facilities were guaranteed by ppl. the ppl guarantee fell away in connection with ppl energy supply's issuance of senior notes described in "financing activities" below. at december 31, 2001, no borrowings were outstanding under any of these facilities, and there were $26 million of letters of credit issued under the $500 million three-year facility. in addition, in june 2001, ppl energy supply entered into a 364-day revolving-credit facility with ppl capital funding. ppl guaranteed ppl capital funding's obligations under this agreement. the credit facility and related guarantee were terminated as of december 20, 2001, and at that time no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility. ppl montana has a $100 million working capital credit facility which matures in november 2002. the maturity date may be extended with the consent of the lenders. this facility provides that up to $75 million of the commitment may be used to cause lenders to issue letters of credit. in the event that ppl montana were to draw upon this facility or cause lenders to issue letters of credit on its behalf, ppl montana would be required to reimburse the issuing lenders. at december 31, 2001, $44 million of loans were outstanding under this facility and $25 million of letters of credit were issued. in april 2001, ppl montana executed a new credit facility to allow for incremental letter of credit capacity of $150 million. there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31, 2001. ppl executed a commitment to the lenders under ppl montana's $150 million credit facility that ppl will provide (or cause ppl energy supply to provide) letters of credit at such times and in such amounts as are necessary to permit ppl montana to remain in compliance with its fixed price forward energy contracts or its derivative financial instruments entered into to manage energy price risks, to the extent that ppl montana cannot provide such letters of credit under its existing credit agreements. no such letters of credit had been issued as of december 31, 2001. financing activities ppl energy supply established a $1.1 billion commercial paper program during december 2001. at december 31, 2001, there was no commercial paper outstanding. in october 2001, ppl energy supply sold $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.40% senior unsecured notes due 2011 in a private placement, and agreed to make an exchange offer to exchange the privately-placed senior notes for publicly-registered senior notes. the exchange offer was completed in february 2002. the new registered senior notes have the same material financial terms as the old senior notes. proceeds of the senior note offering will be used to fund generation development and for general corporate purposes. in 2001, ppl global subsidiaries emel and cemar issued $127 million and $99 million of long-term debt. a portion of cemar's debt was reclassified to short-term debt in conjunction with cemar's impairment. (see note 21.) in 2001, ppl energy supply's member's equity increased from approximately $2.6 billion to $4.0 billion, primarily due to contributions from ppl energy funding. ppl energy funding contributed $920 million of notes and accounts receivable (primarily due from ppl global) to ppl investment corporation, ppl energy supply's financing subsidiary. this contribution was recorded as additional member's equity, and reduced ppl energy supply's consolidated short-term debt payable to affiliates. ppl energy funding also contributed $490 million in cash, net of $463 million of distributions it received from ppl energy supply. see note 10 for a description of ppl energy supply's lease financings. acquisitions, development and divestitures domestic generation projects in january 2001, ppl montour acquired an additional interest in the coal-fired conemaugh power plant from potomac electric power company. under the terms of the acquisition agreement, ppl montour and a subsidiary of allegheny energy, inc. jointly acquired a 9.72% interest in the 1,711 mw plant. ppl montour paid $78 million for this additional 83 mw interest. the purchase increased ppl montour's ownership interest to 16.25% in the two-unit plant. in august 2001, construction began on the university park energy project, a 540 mw natural gas-fired facility located in university park, illinois and on the sundance energy project, a 450 mw natural gas-fired facility in pinal county, arizona. the projects are expected to be in service during the summer of 2002 at an estimated total project cost of approximately $675 million. ppl susquehanna also announced plans to increase the capacity of its susquehanna nuclear plant by 100 mw with the installation of more efficient steam turbines on each of the two units. these improvements will be made in 2003 and 2004 and are expected to cost approximately $120 million. in december 2001, ppl global and the long island power authority entered into agreements to build two 80 mw combustion turbine power facilities at sites in shoreham and edgewood on long island, new york. both facilities are expected to be in service during the summer of 2002 at an estimated total project cost of approximately $180 million. in december 2001, a ppl global subsidiary entered into a synthetic lease financing transaction for the development, construction and operation of its lower mt. bethel combined-cycle generating facility. the air quality plan approval issued by the pennsylvania dep for construction of the lower mt. bethel facility has been appealed by the new jersey dep. ppl energy supply and the ppl global subsidiary intend to work with the pennsylvania dep in opposing this appeal. in addition, the local township zoning hearing board granted zoning approval for the facility, but the approval has been appealed by a township resident as to the decibel levels allowed. an additional appeal was filed by the same resident to the township's issuance of a building permit pending the outcome of the zoning appeal. ppl energy supply and the ppl global subsidiary are aggressively opposing the zoning and building permit appeals. as a result of these three appeals, substantial additional requirements could be imposed on the construction and operation of the facility. if, as a result of these appeals, the construction of the facility could not be completed by september 30, 2004, the ppl global subsidiary, or ppl energy supply as guarantor, could be called upon to repay approximately 90% of the then-outstanding facility costs, plus a make-whole premium on the total amount of debt commitments. alternatively, ppl energy supply could, subject to certain conditions, purchase the facility from the lessor, offer to assume 100% of the outstanding debt, and pay a reduced make-whole premium to any debtholder that does not accept such offer. in light of continuing declines in wholesale energy prices in the eastern and western u.s. markets, ppl global is scaling back its generation development program. as a result, in december 2001, ppl global made a decision to cancel approximately 2,100 mw of previously planned generation development in pennsylvania and washington state. these projects were in the early stage of development and would have had an estimated capital cost of $1.3 billion. the charge for cancellation of these generation projects, which was primarily due to cancellation fees under turbine purchase contracts, was approximately $150 million, and is reported on the statement of income as "cancellation of generation projects," a component of "other charges." international distribution projects in january 2001, ppl global purchased an additional 5.6% direct and indirect equity interest in cge from the claro group, bringing its total investment to $141 million, or about 8.5%. cge provides electricity delivery service to 1.4 million customers throughout chile and natural gas delivery service to 200,000 customers in santiago. in may 2001, wpdl successfully completed the sale of hyder's water business, welsh water, to the welsh firm glas cymru cyfyngedig for one british pound sterling and the assumption of all of welsh water's debt. in september 2001, ppl global increased its capital investment by 4.9% in cemar by purchasing the 25.7 billion shares of cemar that were held by cemar's employees at a price of $13 million. the increase resulted in a total 89.6% ownership in cemar. in december, 2001, ppl global purchased an 80% interest in el salvador telecom, a small telecommunications company in el salvador, for an initial investment of $8 million. in december 2001, ppl global recorded impairment charges for its investments in cemar, wpd 1953 and wpdl. see note 21 for additional information. leases ppl energy supply applies the provisions of sfas 13, "accounting for leases", to all leasing transactions. in addition, ppl applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for leases. in july 2000, ppl montana sold its interest in the colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to ppl montana under four 36-year operating leases. the proceeds from this sale approximated $410 million. ppl montana used the proceeds to reduce outstanding debt and make distributions to its parent, ppl generation. ppl montana leases a 50% interest in colstrip units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in unit 3, through four non-cancelable operating leases. the leases provide two renewal options based on the economic useful life of the generation assets. in november 2000, a ppl global subsidiary entered into a $555 million operating lease arrangement for turbine generator units, and related equipment (scrs, transformers and spare engines). certain obligations of the ppl global subsidiary under this lease financing, including payment obligations, have been guaranteed by ppl. the units are expected to go into service as they are completed, beginning in 2002. in may 2001, a ppl global subsidiary entered into an operating lease arrangement, initially for $900 million and increased in july 2001 to $1.06 billion upon syndication, for the development, construction and operation of several commercial power generation facilities. certain obligations of the ppl global subsidiary under this lease financing, including payment obligations, have been guaranteed by ppl energy supply. in february 2002, the ppl global subsidiary reduced the available commitment under the lease to approximately $700 million. there is a residual value guarantee that is expected to be up to $545 million at the end of the lease. in december 2001, a ppl global subsidiary entered into an operating lease arrangement for $455 million for the development, construction and operation of a 600 mw gas-fired combined-cycle generation facility located in lower mt. bethel township, northampton county, pennsylvania. the facility is expected to be operational in 2004. certain obligations of the ppl global subsidiary under this lease financing, including payment obligations, have been guaranteed by ppl energy supply. there is a residual value guarantee that is expected to be up to $321 million at the end of the lease. in addition to the leasing arrangements discussed above, ppl energy supply also has leases for vehicles, office space, land, personal computers and other equipment. total future minimum lease payments for all operating leases are estimated as follows (millions of dollars): 2002, $343; 2003, $92; 2004, $136; 2005, $131; 2006, $99; and thereafter, $865. stock-based compensation under the ppl incentive compensation plan ("icp") and the incentive compensation plan for key employees ("icpke") (together, the "plans"), restricted shares of ppl common stock as well as stock options may be granted to officers and other key employees of ppl and other affiliated companies, including ppl energy supply. awards under the plans are made in the common stock of ppl by the compensation and corporate governance committee ("ccgc") of the ppl board of directors in the case of the icp, and by the ppl corporate leadership council ("clc") in the case of the icpke. each plan limits the number of shares available for awards to two percent of the outstanding common stock of ppl on the first day of each calendar year. the maximum number of options which can be awarded under each plan to any single eligible employee in any calendar year is 1.5 million shares. any portion of these options that has not been granted may be carried over and used in any subsequent year. if any award lapses or is forfeited or the rights to the participant terminate, any shares of common stock are again available for grant. shares delivered under the plans may be in the form of authorized and unissued common stock, common stock held in treasury by ppl or common stock purchased on the open market (including private purchases) in accordance with applicable securities laws. restricted stock restricted shares of ppl common stock are outstanding shares with full voting and dividend rights. however, the shares are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death. restricted shares vest fully if control of ppl changes, as defined by the plans. restricted stock awards of 141,289; 227,858; and 25,100 shares, with per share weighted-average fair values of $42.68, $21.52, and $26.77, were granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999 to employees of ppl energy supply subsidiaries. compensation expense for 2001 was $3 million and was not significant in 2000 and 1999. at december 31, 2001, there were 442,836 restricted shares outstanding. these awards currently vest from three to twenty-three years from the date of grant. stock options under the plans, stock options may also be granted with an option exercise price per share not less than the fair market value of ppl's common stock on the date of grant. the options are exercisable beginning one year after the date of grant, assuming the individual is still employed by ppl or a subsidiary, in installments as determined by the ccgc in the case of the icp, and the clc in the case of the icpke. the clc and ccgc have discretion to accelerate the exercisability of the options. all options expire no later than ten years from the grant date. the options become exercisable if control of ppl changes, as defined by the plans. ppl applies apb opinion no. 25 "accounting for stock issued to employees," and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. since stock options are granted at the then current market price, no compensation cost has been recognized. compensation calculated in accordance with the disclosure requirements of sfas 123, "accounting for stock-based compensation," for 2001, 2000 and 1999 would not have been significant. a summary of stock option activity follows: stock option activity number of options weighted average exercise price balance at

their grant date during 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $10.42, $3.35 and $2.37. the estimated fair value of each option granted was calculated using a modified black-scholes option-pricing model. the weighted average assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2001 2000 1999 risk-free interest rate 5.46% 6.74% 5.61% expected option term 10 yrs 10 yrs 10 yrs expected stock volatility 30.24%

postretirement benefits various subsidiaries of ppl energy supply sponsor pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans. ppl energy supply follows the guidance of sfas 87, "employers' accounting for pensions" and sfas 106, "employers' accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions" for these benefits. ppl montana sponsors a funded, noncontributory defined benefit plan covering substantially all employees. cemar sponsors a funded, contributory defined benefit plan covering substantially all employees. ppl montana and ppl global also sponsor supplemental retirement plans that provide benefits to key management employees through unfunded nonqualified plans. ppl montana also sponsors a postretirement plan to provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for its employees upon retirement. employees of other ppl generation subsidiaries and ppl energyplus are provided with pension and postretirement benefits under plans sponsored by ppl services corporation. net pension and postretirement medical benefit costs for the domestic plans sponsored by ppl montana and ppl global were (millions of dollars): pension benefits postretirement medical benefits 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 service cost $ 2 $ 2 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 interest cost 4 2 0.2 0.3 0.3 expected return on plan assets (3 ) (2 ) prior service cost 0.2 net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost $ 3 $ 2 $ 0.6 $ 0.5 $ 0.5 net pension costs for the international plan sponsored by cemar were (millions of dollars): pension benefit 2001 service cost $ 1 interest cost 3 expected return on plan assets (3 ) net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost $ 1 ppl generation subsidiaries and ppl energyplus are allocated a portion of the liabilities and costs of the pension plans sponsored by ppl services based on their participation in those plans. the liabilities assumed by ppl energy supply for these plans total $49 million at december 31, 2001. ppl energy supply was allocated net periodic pension credits of $(23) million in 2001. amounts allocated in 2000 and 1999 were not significant. in 2001, ppl changed its method of amortizing unrecognized gains or losses in the annual pension expense/income determined under sfas 87, "employers' accounting for pensions." this change resulted in a cumulative-effect credit of $3 million after-tax, which is reflected as a "cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle" on the statement of income. under the old method, unrecognized gains and losses in excess of ten percent of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets were amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated average future service period of plan participants. under the new method, a second corridor will be utilized for unrecognized gains and losses in excess of thirty percent of the plan's projected benefit obligation. unrecognized gains and losses outside the second corridor will be amortized on a straight-line method over a period equal to one-half of the average future service period of the plan participants. the new method is preferable under sfas 87 because it provides more current recognition of gains and losses, thereby lessening the accumulation of unrecognized gains and losses. the pro-forma effect of retroactive application of this change in accounting principle would have reduced net income by $3 million in 2001 and increased net income by $2 million in 2000 and by $1 million in prior periods. ppl generation subsidiaries and ppl energyplus are also allocated a portion of the liabilities and costs of the postretirement medical plans sponsored by ppl services based on their participation in those plans. postretirement medical costs allocated to ppl energy supply were approximately $9 million in 2001 and were not significant in 2000 and 1999. at december 31, 2001, the balance in ppl energy supply's allocated share of the total postretirement medical liability was $3 million. postretirement medical costs at december 31, 2001 for the ppl montana sponsored plan were based on the assumption that costs would increase 7% in 2001, then the rate of increase would decline gradually to 6% in 2006 and thereafter. a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend assumption would increase the service cost and interest cost by $27,000 and increase the postretirement benefit obligation by $234,000. a one percent decrease in the assumed health care cost trend assumption would decrease the service cost and interest cost by $24,000 and decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $203,000. the following assumptions were used in the valuation of ppl montana and ppl global domestic benefit obligations: pension benefits 2001 2000 1999 discount rate 7.25% 7.5% 7.0% expected return on plan assets 9.2% 9.2% 8.5% rate of compensation increase 4.25% 4.75%

pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were (in millions) $81, $65 and $47, as of december 31, 2001 and $4, $2 and $0 as of december 31, 2000. subsidiaries engaged in the mechanical contracting business make contributions to various union-sponsored multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans. contributions of $14 million, $10 million and $8 million were made in 2001, 2000 and 1999. savings plans substantially all u.s. employees of ppl energy supply are eligible to participate in deferred savings plans (401(k)s). company contributions to the plans charged to operating expense were $5 million in 2001, $4 million in 2000 and $1 million in 1999. substantially all employees of ppl generation and ppl energyplus are eligible to participate in the ppl esop. these companies receive a small allocation of their share of the cost. postemployment benefits ppl generation and ppl energyplus provide health and life insurance benefits to disabled employees and income benefits to eligible spouses of deceased employees. postemployment benefits charged to operating expenses were not significant in 2001, 2000 or 1999. certain of ppl global subsidiaries, including emel, ec, elfec and integra, provide limited non-pension benefits to all current employees. all active employees are entitled to benefits in the event of termination or retirement in accordance with government sponsored programs. these plans generally obligate a company to pay one month's salary per year of service to employees in the event of involuntary termination. under certain plans, employees with five or more years of service are entitled to this payment in the event of voluntary or involuntary termination. there is no limit on the number of years of service in calculation of the benefit obligation. the liabilities for these plans are accounted for under the guidance of eitf 88-1 &quot;determination of vested benefit obligation for a defined benefit pension plan&quot; using what is commonly referred to as the &quot;shut down&quot; method, where a company records the undiscounted obligation as if it was payable at each balance sheet date. the combined liabilities for these plans at december 31, 2001 and 2000 were $6 million, and are recorded in &quot;deferred credits and noncurrent liabilities - other&quot; on the balance sheet. jointly-owned facilities at december 31, 2001, subsidiaries of ppl energy supply owned undivided interests in the following facilities (millions of dollars): ownership interest electric plant in service other property accumulated depreciation construction work in progress ppl generation generating stations susquehanna 90.00% $ 4,196 $ 3,525 $ 24 keystone 12.34% 71 46 6 wyman 8.33% 15 2 conemaugh 16.25% 185 58 4 merrill creek reservoir 8.37% $ 22 12 ppl montana also has 50% and 30% undivided leasehold interests in colstrip units 1 and 2 and colstrip unit 3, respectively. each ppl generation subsidiary provided its own funding for its share of the facility. each receives a portion of the total output of the generating stations equal to its percentage ownership. the share of fuel and other operating costs associated with the stations is reflected on the statement of income. commitments and contingent liabilities ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries are involved in numerous legal proceedings, claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material liabilities. wholesale energy commitments as part of the purchase of generation assets from montana power, ppl montana agreed to supply electricity under two wholesale transition service agreements. in addition, ppl montana assumed a power purchase agreement and another power sales agreement. in accordance with purchase accounting guidelines, ppl montana recorded a liability of $118 million as the estimated fair value of these agreements at the acquisition date. this liability is being amortized over the agreement terms as adjustments to "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues and "energy purchases" on the statement of income. the unamortized balance at december 31, 2001 was $78 million and is included in "other" in the "deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities" section of the balance sheet. in october 2001, ppl announced that ppl energyplus reached an agreement to supply montana power with an aggregate of 450 mw of energy to be supplied by ppl montana. the delivery term of this new contract is for five years beginning july 1, 2002, which is the day after the termination date of the last of the two existing contracts, pursuant to which ppl montana presently supplies energy to montana power for its default supply. under the agreement, ppl energyplus will supply 300 mw of around-the-clock electricity and 150 mw of on-peak electricity. in december 2001, the agreement was accepted for filing by the ferc. no further regulatory approvals are required under this agreement. liability for above market nug contracts in 1998 when its generation business was deregulated, ppl electric recorded a loss accrual for above market contracts with nugs of $854 million. effective january 1999, ppl electric began reducing this liability as an offset to "energy purchases" on the statement of income. this reduction is based on the estimated timing of the purchases from the nugs and projected market prices for this generation. the final existing nug contract expires in 2014. in connection with the corporate realignment, effective july 1, 2000, the remaining balance of this liability was transferred to ppl energyplus. the liabilities associated with these above market nug contracts were $580 million at december 31, 2001. commitments - acquisitions and development activities ppl global and its subsidiaries have committed additional capital and extended loans to certain affiliates, joint ventures and partnerships in which they have an interest. at december 31, 2001, ppl global and its subsidiaries had approximately $561 million of such commitments. the majority of these commitments were for the purchase of lm-6000 turbine generators from general electric. the general electric commitments have been reduced due to the decision to cancel generation projects as described in note 9. mpsc order in june 2001, the mpsc issued an order (mpsc order) in which it found that montana power must continue to provide electric service to its customers at tariffed rates until its transition plan under the montana electricity utility industry restructuring and customer choice act is finally approved, and that purchasers of generating assets from montana power must provide electricity to meet montana power's full load requirements at prices to montana power that reflect costs calculated as if the generating assets had not been sold. ppl montana purchased montana power's interests in two coal-fired plants and 11 hydroelectric units in 1999. in july 2001, ppl montana filed a complaint against the mpsc with the u.s. district court in helena, montana, challenging the mpsc order. in its complaint, ppl montana asserted, among other things, that the federal power act preempts states from exercising regulatory authority over the sale of electricity in wholesale markets, and requested the court to declare the mpsc action preempted, unconstitutional and void. in addition, the complaint requested that the mpsc be enjoined from seeking to exercise any authority, control or regulation of wholesale sales from ppl montana's generating assets. at this time, ppl energy supply cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings related to the mpsc order, what actions the mpsc, the montana legislature or any other governmental authority may take on these or related matters, or the ultimate impact on ppl energy supply and ppl montana of any of these matters. montana power shareholders' litigation in august 2001, a purported class-action lawsuit was filed by a group of shareholders of montana power against montana power, the directors of montana power, certain unnamed advisors and consultants of montana power, and ppl montana. the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that montana power was required to, and did not, obtain shareholder approval of the sale of montana power's generation assets to ppl montana in 1999. although most of the claims in the complaint are against montana power, its board of directors, and its consultants and advisors, two claims are asserted against ppl montana. in the first claim, plaintiffs seek a declaration that because montana power shareholders did not vote on the 1999 sale of generating assets to ppl montana, that sale "was null and void ab initio." the second claim alleges that ppl montana was privy to and participated in a strategy whereby montana power would sell its generation assets to ppl montana without first obtaining montana power shareholder approval, and that ppl montana has made net profits in excess of $100 million as the result of this alleged illegal sale. in the second claim, plaintiffs request that the court impose a "resulting and/or constructive trust" on both the generation assets themselves and all profits, plus interest on the amounts subject to the trust. ppl energy supply and ppl montana are unable to predict the outcome of this matter. employee litigation in april 2000, three employees at ppl montana's colstrip facility were severely burned when an equipment fault in colstrip unit 1 caused electrical arcing. in may 2000, the injured employees and their spouses filed litigation for their injuries in montana district court against montana power. ppl montana was subsequently named as a party defendant to the pending litigation, and a trial has been scheduled for june 2002. at this time, ppl energy supply and ppl montana cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter. puc investigation order in november 2001, the pjm market monitor publicly released a report prepared for the puc entitled &quot;capacity market questions&quot; relating to the pricing of installed capacity in the pjm daily market during the first quarter of 2001. the report concludes that ppl energyplus (identified in the report as &quot;entity 1&quot;) was able to exercise market power to raise the market-clearing price above the competitive level during that period. ppl energyplus does not agree with the market monitor's conclusions that it exercised market power; in addition, the market monitor acknowledged in his report that pjm's standards and rules did not prohibit ppl energyplus' conduct. in november 2001, the puc issued an investigation order directing its law bureau to conduct an investigation into the pjm capacity market and the allegations in the market monitor's report. in january 2002, ppl filed comments as requested by the investigation order. the order does not suggest what, if any, action the puc may take as a result of the investigation, other than considering possible changes to its competitive safeguards. while ppl energyplus and ppl electric have filed comments with the puc as part of the investigation, they have both taken the position that the puc does not have jurisdiction to regulate the pjm capacity markets as those markets are for wholesale electricity transactions and accordingly are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ferc. in addition, ppl energyplus and ppl electric believe that ppl energyplus' actions under review were at all times lawful and consistent with the rules of the market. at this time, neither ppl energyplus nor ppl electric can predict the outcome of the puc investigation or what action the puc may take in connection with the investigation. ferc market-based rates in december 1998, the ferc issued an order authorizing ppl energyplus to make wholesale sales of electric power and related products at market-based rates. in that order, the ferc directed ppl energyplus to file an updated market analysis within three years of the date of the order, and every three years thereafter. ppl energyplus filed its initial updated market analysis in december 2001. several parties thereafter filed interventions and protests requesting that, in light of the pjm market monitor's report described above, ppl energyplus be required to provide additional information demonstrating that it has met the ferc's market power tests necessary for ppl energyplus to continue its market-based rate authority. ppl energyplus has responded to those protests and interventions. ppl energyplus has taken the position that the ferc does not require the economic test suggested by the intervenors and that, in any event, it would meet such economic test if required by the ferc. the matter is currently pending before the ferc. energy supply to energy west resources, inc. in july 2001, ppl montana filed an action in state court and a responsive pleading in federal court, both related to a breach of contract by energy west resources, inc. (energy west), a great falls, montana-based energy aggregator. ppl montana is seeking a judgment that energy west violated the terms of the contract under which it supplies energy to energy west and should pay damages of at least $7.5 million. all litigation in this matter has been consolidated in the u.s. district court for the district of montana, great falls division, and is proceeding in that forum. ppl energy supply and ppl montana cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings. proposed montana hydroelectric initiative in january 2002, the montana secretary of state certified, in accordance with applicable statutes, that it had approved the form of a proposed montana &quot;hydroelectric security act&quot; initiative. the proposed initiative may be placed on the november 2002 statewide ballot if sufficient signatures are obtained prior to june 21, 2002. among the stated purposes of the proposed initiative is to create an elected montana public power commission to determine whether purchasing hydroelectric dams in montana is in the public interest. such a commission could decide to acquire ppl montana's hydroelectric dams either pursuant to a negotiated purchase or an acquisition at fair market value through the power of condemnation. at this time, ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl montana cannot predict whether the proposed initiative will garner enough signatures for placement on the november 2002 statewide ballot, whether there will be a successful legal challenge to the initiative, whether it would pass if on the ballot or what impact, if any, the measure might ultimately have upon ppl montana or its hydroelectric operations. ppl montana has declared its opposition to, and intends to vigorously oppose, the initiative. nuclear insurance ppl susquehanna is a member of certain insurance programs which provide coverage for property damage to members' nuclear generating stations. facilities at the susquehanna station are insured against property damage losses up to $2.75 billion under these programs. ppl susquehanna is also a member of an insurance program which provides insurance coverage for the cost of replacement power during prolonged outages of nuclear units caused by certain specified conditions. under the property and replacement power insurance programs, ppl susquehanna could be assessed retroactive premiums in the event of the insurers' adverse loss experience. at december 31, 2001, this maximum assessment was about $20 million. ppl susquehanna's public liability for claims resulting from a nuclear incident at the susquehanna station is limited to about $9.5 billion under provisions of the price anderson amendments act of 1988. ppl susquehanna is protected against this liability by a combination of commercial insurance and an industry assessment program. in the event of a nuclear incident at any of the reactors covered by the price anderson amendments act of 1988, ppl susquehanna could be assessed up to $176 million per incident, payable at $20 million per year. environmental matters in connection with the corporate realignment, effective july 1, 2000, ppl generation assumed air, water and residual waste contingent liabilities associated with the generation assets of ppl electric. air the clean air act deals, in part, with acid rain, attainment of federal ambient ozone standards and toxic air emissions in the u.s. ppl energy supply subsidiaries are in substantial compliance with the clean air act. the bush administration and certain members of congress have made proposals regarding possible amendments to the clean air act. these amendments could require significant further reductions in no x , so 2 and mercury and could possibly require measures to limit co 2 . the pennsylvania dep has finalized regulations requiring further seasonal (may-june) no x reductions to 80% from 1990 levels starting in 2003. these further reductions are based on the requirements of the northeast ozone transport region memorandum of understanding and two epa ambient ozone initiatives: the september 1998 epa state implementation plan (sip) call (i.e., epa's requirement for states to revise their sips) issued under section 110 of the clean air act, requiring reductions from 22 eastern states, including pennsylvania; and the epa's approval of petitions filed by northeastern states, requiring reductions from sources in 12 northeastern states and washington d.c., including ppl energy supply sources. the epa's sip-call was substantially upheld by the d.c. circuit court of appeals in an appeals proceeding. although the court extended the implementation deadline to may 2004, the pennsylvania dep has not changed its rules accordingly. ppl energy supply expects to achieve the 2003 no x reductions with the recent installation of scr technology on the montour units and the possible use of scr or sncr technology on a brunner island unit. the epa has also developed new standards for ambient levels of ozone and particulates in the u.s. these standards were challenged and remanded to the epa by the d.c. circuit court of appeals in 1999. however, on appeal to the united states supreme court, the d.c. circuit court's decision was reversed in part and remanded to the d.c. circuit court. the new particulates standard, if finalized, may require further reductions in so 2 for certain ppl energy supply subsidiaries and year-round no x reductions commencing in 2010-2012 at sip-call levels in pennsylvania, and at slightly less stringent levels in montana. the revised ozone standard, if finalized, is not expected to have a material effect on facilities of ppl energy supply subsidiaries. under the clean air act, the epa has been studying the health effects of hazardous air emissions from power plants and other sources, in order to determine what emissions should be regulated, and has determined that mercury emissions must be regulated. in this regard, the epa is expected to develop regulations by 2004. in 1999, the epa initiated enforcement actions against several utilities, asserting that older, coal-fired power plants operated by those utilities have, over the years, been modified in ways that subject them to more stringent "new source" requirements under the clean air act. the epa has since issued notices of violation and commenced enforcement activities against other utilities. although the epa has threatened to continue expanding its enforcement actions, the future direction of the "new source" requirements is presently unclear. therefore, at this time, ppl energy supply is unable to predict whether such epa enforcement actions will be brought with respect to any of its affiliates' plants. however, the epa regional offices that regulate plants in pennsylvania (region iii) and montana (region viii) have indicated an intention to issue information requests to all utilities in their jurisdiction, and the region viii office has issued such a request to ppl montana's corette plant. ppl energy supply has responded to the information request. ppl energy supply cannot presently predict what, if any, action the epa might take following ppl energy supply's responses to such information requests. should the epa or any state initiate one or more enforcement actions against any ppl energy supply subsidiary, compliance with any such enforcement actions could result in additional capital and operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but which could be significant. the epa is also proposing to revise its regulations in a way that will require power plants to meet "new source" performance standards and/or undergo "new source" review for many maintenance and repair activities that are currently exempt. the new jersey dep and some new jersey residents have raised environmental concerns with respect to the martins creek plant, particularly with respect to so 2 emissions. ppl martins creek is discussing these concerns with the new jersey dep. in addition, the plant experienced several opacity violations in the first and second quarters of 2001 for which it paid a civil penalty of $30,300 and funded an environmental project for $90,000. the cost of addressing new jersey's so 2 concerns and the opacity issues is not now determinable but could be significant. see note 9 for information on the lower mt. bethel appeal by the new jersey dep. water/waste the final npdes permit for the montour plant contains stringent limits for iron discharges. the results of a toxic reduction study show that additional water treatment facilities or operational changes are needed at this station. a plan for these changes has been developed and was submitted to the pennsylvania dep in august 2001. a final npdes permit has been issued to the brunner island plant. the permit contains a provision requiring further studies on the thermal impact of the cooling water discharge from the plant. depending on the outcome of these studies, the plant could be subject to capital and operating costs that are not now determinable but could be significant. the epa has significantly tightened the water quality standard for arsenic. the lower standard may require ppl energy supply subsidiaries to further treat wastewater and/or take abatement action at several of their power plants, the cost of which is not now determinable, but which could be significant. the epa recently finalized requirements for new or modified water intake structures. these requirements will affect where generating facilities are built, will establish intake design standards, and could lead to requirements for cooling towers at new and modified power plants. another new rule, expected to be finalized in 2003, will address existing structures. each of these rules are also expected to result in increased operating costs in amounts which are not now determinable, but which could be significant. montana issues in october 1999, the montana supreme court held in favor of several citizens' groups that the right to a clean and healthful environment is a fundamental right guaranteed by the montana constitution. the court's ruling could result in significantly more stringent environmental laws and regulations, as well as an increase in citizens' suits under montana's environmental laws. the effects on ppl energy supply and ppl montana of any such changes in laws or regulations or any such increase in legal actions is not currently determinable, but it could be significant. under the montana power asset purchase agreement, ppl montana is indemnified by montana power for any pre-acquisition environmental liabilities. however, this indemnification is conditioned on certain circumstances that could result in ppl montana and montana power sharing in certain costs within limits set forth in the agreement. future cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at sites not currently identified, may result in material additional operating costs for ppl subsidiaries that cannot be estimated at this time. general certain of ppl energy supply's subsidiaries have electric distribution operations in the u.k. and latin america. ppl energy supply believes that these operations are in compliance with applicable laws and government regulations to protect the environment. ppl energy supply is not aware of any material or administrative proceeding against these companies with respect to any environmental matter. due to the environmental issues discussed above or other environmental matters, ppl energy supply subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies or courts. in this regard, ppl energy supply subsidiaries also may incur capital expenditures, operating expenses and other costs in amounts which are not now determinable, but which could be significant. credit support ppl provides certain guarantees for ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2001, ppl had guaranteed certain obligations under power purchase and sales agreements of ppl energyplus for up to $1 billion and of ppl montana for up to $138 million. ppl has also guaranteed certain obligations of other ppl energy supply subsidiaries, totaling $256 million at december 31, 2001. ppl energy supply also guarantees certain obligations under power purchase and sales agreements for ppl energyplus totaling $121 million and certain obligations of other subsidiaries totaling $600 million. see note 8 for discussion of credit support for ppl montana and guarantees under ppl energy supply's credit facilities. source of labor supply at december 31, 2001, ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries had 7,302 full-time employees. this included 2,550 in ppl generation, 1,943 in ppl energyplus, 44 in ppl global, and 2,765 in several central and south american electric companies controlled by ppl global. approximately 55%, or 2,500 employees, of ppl energy supply's domestic workforce are members of labor unions, with three ibew locals representing the majority of them. the bargaining agreement with the largest union was negotiated in 1998 and expires in may of 2002. new contracts were also concluded with two ibew locals in montana. ppl montana is currently negotiating with the teamsters union for a new agreement. related party transactions ppl, through ppl capital funding and other subsidiaries, provides certain funding and credit support for ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries. such funding includes loans that are due on demand with interest charged at a rate based on ppl capital funding's short-term borrowing rate. in addition, ppl energy supply has notes receivable from other affiliates of ppl. interest earned on loans to affiliated companies and interest incurred on borrowings from affiliated companies are included in "other income - net" and "interest expense," respectively, in the statement of income. intercompany interest income (in millions) was $57 and $13 for 2001 and 2000, respectively. intercompany interest expense (in millions) was $26, $86 and $37 in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. notes receivable from affiliated companies at december 31, 2001 were $395 million. there were no notes payable to affiliated companies at december 31, 2001. ppl global provided temporary financing to wpdl and wpd 1953 in connection with the acquisition of hyder. the outstanding loan receivables and accrued interest, 154.5 million british pounds sterling (approximately $220 million), were repaid in may 2001. at december 31, 2000, ppl global had a $135 million note payable to an affiliate of wpd 1953. the note was denominated in u.s. dollars, and provided for interest at market rates. ppl global repaid this note in january 2001. as part of the corporate realignment, ppl electric entered into power sales agreements with ppl energyplus for the purchase of electricity to meet its obligations as a plr for customers who have not selected an alternative supplier under the customer choice act. under the terms of these agreements, this electricity was purchased by ppl electric at the applicable shopping credits authorized by the puc, plus nuclear decommissioning costs, less state taxes. these sales totaled $1.3 billion in 2001 and $540 million in the last half of 2000, and are included in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" on the statement of income. these agreements expired on december 31, 2001. in june 2001, ppl energyplus executed a new contract, effective january 1, 2002, to supply all of ppl electric's plr load from 2002 through 2009. under this contract, ppl energyplus will provide electricity at the pre-determined capped prices that ppl electric is authorized to charge its plr customers. in addition, ppl electric paid ppl energyplus $90 million to offset differences between the revenues expected under the capped prices and projected market prices through the life of the supply agreement (as projected by ppl energyplus at the time of its contract offer). the contract resulted in ppl energyplus having an eight-year contract at current market prices. ppl has guaranteed the obligations of ppl energyplus under the new contract. in july 2001, the contract was approved by the puc and accepted for filing by the ferc. also as part of the corporate realignment, ppl electric executed a reciprocal contract with ppl energyplus to sell electricity purchased under contracts with nugs. ppl electric purchases electricity from the nugs at contractual rates, and then sells the electricity at the same price to ppl energyplus. these expenses totaled $176 million in 2001 and $85 million in the last half of 2000, and are included in "energy purchases" on the statement of income. since ppl energy supply owns no domestic transmission or distribution facilities, other than facilities to interconnect its generation with the electric transmission system, ppl energyplus, ppl montana and other ppl generation subsidiaries must pay ppl electric, the owner of a transmission system, to deliver the energy these subsidiaries supply to retail and wholesale customers in ppl electric's franchised territory in eastern and central pennsylvania. corporate functions such as financial, legal, human resources and information services were transferred to ppl services in the corporate realignment. ppl services bills the respective ppl subsidiaries for the cost of such services when they can be specifically identified. the cost of these services that are not directly charged to ppl subsidiaries is allocated to certain of the subsidiaries based on the relative capital invested by ppl in these subsidiaries. for 2001 and the six months ended december 31, 2000, ppl services charged ppl energy supply subsidiaries approximately $80 million and $19 million for direct expenses, and allocated these entities approximately $39 million and $14 million of overhead costs. corporate realignment on july 1, 2000, ppl and ppl electric completed a corporate realignment in order to effectively separate ppl electric's regulated transmission and distribution operations from its recently deregulated generation operations and to better position the companies and their affiliates in the new competitive marketplace. the realignment included ppl electric's transfer of certain generation and related assets, and associated liabilities, to ppl and ppl energy funding at book value. ppl energy funding contributed certain of these generating and unregulated marketing assets and liabilities at a net book value of approximately $1.6 billion, to ppl generation and ppl energyplus. the following increases (in millions) resulted from these non-cash contributions: assets notes receivable from affiliated companies $ 427 unrealized energy trading gains 105 nuclear plant decommissioning trust fund 269 property, plant and equipment 1,932 fuel, materials and supplies 144 other assets 30 $ 2,907 liabilities and equity unrealized energy trading losses $ 105 above market nug contracts 723 deferred income taxes 52 other noncurrent liabilities 394 other liabilities 45 member's equity 1,588 $ 2,907 ppl energy supply was subsequently formed as a subsidiary of ppl energy funding, to serve as the parent company for the unregulated subsidiaries. as a result of the corporate realignment, ppl generation's principal business is owning and operating u.s. generating facilities through various subsidiaries; ppl energyplus' principal business is unregulated wholesale and retail energy marketing; and ppl global's principal businesses are the acquisition and development of both u.s. and international energy projects, and the ownership and operation of international projects. the corporate realignment followed receipt of various regulatory approvals, including approvals from the irs, the puc, the ferc, and the nrc. new accounting standards sfas 141 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 141, "business combinations," which eliminates the pooling-of-interest method of accounting for business combinations and requires the use of the purchase method. in addition, sfas 141 requires the reassessment of intangible assets to determine if they are appropriately classified either separately or within goodwill. sfas 141 is effective for business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001. ppl energy supply adopted sfas 141 on july 1, 2001, with no material impact on the financial statements. sfas 142 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 142, "goodwill and other intangible assets," which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite economic useful lives. sfas 142 requires an annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization. ppl energy supply adopted sfas 142 on january 1, 2002. in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142, ppl energy supply ceased amortization of goodwill and all intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. the elimination of amortization will result in $16 million less expense (pre-tax) in 2002. in addition, ppl energy supply is in the process of conducting the transition impairment analysis and may record a goodwill impairment of up to $100 million (pre-tax) as a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002. the potential impairment relates to reporting units within the international segment. sfas 143 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 143, "accounting for asset retirement obligations," on the accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. sfas 143 requires a liability to be recognized in the financial statements for retirement obligations meeting specific criteria. measurement of the initial obligation is to approximate fair value, with an equivalent amount recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset. the asset will be depreciated in accordance with normal depreciation policy and the liability will be increased, with a charge to the income statement, until the obligation is settled. sfas 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15, 2002. the potential impact of adopting sfas 143 is not yet determinable, but may be material. sfas 144 in august 2001, the fasb issued sfas 144, "accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets," that replaces sfas 121, "accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of." for long-lived assets to be held and used, sfas 144 retains the requirements of sfas 121 to (a) recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows and (b) measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. for long-lived assets to be disposed of, sfas 144 establishes a single accounting model based on the framework established in sfas 121. the accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long-lived assets, including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no. 30, "reporting the results of operations - reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business, and extraordinary, unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions," for the disposal of segments of a business. sfas 144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations. ppl energy supply adopted sfas 144 on january 1, 2002, with no material impact on the financial statements. derivative instruments and hedging activities ppl energy supply adopted sfas 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities," on january 1, 2001. upon adoption and in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas 133, ppl energy supply recorded a cumulative-effect credit of $11 million in earnings, included as an increase to "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues and a decrease to "energy purchases" on the statement of income. ppl energy supply also recorded a cumulative-effect charge of $182 million in "accumulated other comprehensive income", a component of member's equity. as of december 31, 2001, the balance in "accumulated other comprehensive income" related to unrealized gains and losses on qualifying derivatives was a net gain of $46 million, as a result of reclassifying part of the transition adjustment into earnings, changes in market prices and the adoption of dig issue c15 (see discussion in "implementation issues" below). management of market risk exposures ppl energy supply's market risk exposure is the adverse effect on the value of a transaction that results from a change in commodity prices. the market risk associated with commodity prices is managed by the establishment and monitoring of parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. ppl energy supply actively manages the market risk inherent in its positions. the ppl board of directors has adopted risk management policies to manage the risk exposures related to energy prices. these policies monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and use derivative instruments to manage some associated commodity activities. ppl energy supply's derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of the rmc. the rmc is composed of the chief financial officer and other officers of ppl. the rmc reports to the finance committee of the ppl board of directors on the scope of its derivative activities. the rmc sets forth risk-management philosophy and objectives through a corporate policy, provides guidelines for derivative-instrument usage, and establishes procedures for control and valuation, counterparty credit approval and the monitoring and reporting of derivative activity. ppl energy supply utilizes forward contracts, futures contracts, options and swaps as part of its risk management strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity prices. all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, unless they meet sfas 133's criteria for exclusion (see discussion in "implementation issues" below). fair value hedges ppl energy supply enters into financial contracts to hedge a portion of the fair values of firm commitments of forward electricity sales. these contracts range in maturity through 2004. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001, ppl energy supply recognized a net gain of $7 million resulting from firm commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges (reported in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues and "energy purchases" on the statement of income). ppl energy supply did not recognize any gains or losses from the ineffective portion of fair value hedges. cash flow hedges ppl energy supply enters into physical and financial contracts including, forwards, futures and swaps, to hedge the price risk associated with electric, gas and oil commodities. these contracts range in maturity through 2008. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001, ppl energy supply recorded a net gain of $28 million in "accumulated other comprehensive income" relating to these contracts. as a result of an unplanned outage and changes in other economic conditions, ppl energy supply discontinued certain cash flow hedges which resulted in a net loss of $14 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001 (reported in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues on the statement of income). the impact on the financial statements resulting from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001 was immaterial. as of december 31, 2001, the deferred net gain on derivative instruments in "accumulated other comprehensive income" expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months was $11 million. implementation issues on june 29, 2001, the fasb issued definitive guidance on dig issue c15: "scope exceptions: normal purchases and normal sales exception for option-type contracts and forward contracts in electricity." issue c15 provides additional guidance on the classification and application of sfas 133 relating to purchases and sales of electricity utilizing forward contracts and options. this guidance became effective as of july 1, 2001. in december 2001, the fasb revised the guidance in issue c15, principally related to the eligibility of options for the normal purchases and normal sales exception. the revised guidance is effective as of january 1, 2002. purchases and sales of forward electricity and option contracts that require physical delivery and which are expected to be used or sold by the reporting entity in the normal course of business would generally be considered "normal purchases and normal sales" under sfas 133. these transactions, while within the scope of sfas 133, are not required to be marked to fair value in the financial statements because they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception. as of december 31, 2001, "accumulated other comprehensive income" included a net gain of $11 million related to forward transactions classified as cash flow hedges prior to the adoption of dig issue c15 guidance. this gain will be reversed from "accumulated other comprehensive income" and recognized in earnings as the contracts deliver through 2008. unrealized gains/(losses) on qualifying derivatives (millions of dollars) (after-tax) december 31, 2001 cumulative unrealized gains on derivatives, beginning of period: $ 0 unrealized gains (losses) arising during period: cumulative effect of change in accounting principle at january 1, 2001 (182 ) net reclassification into earnings 2 net change associated with current period hedging transactions 226 unrealized gain on qualifying derivatives 46 cumulative unrealized gains on qualifying derivatives, end of period $ 46 credit concentration ppl energy supply enters into contracts with many entities for the purchase and sale of energy. most of these contracts are considered a normal part of doing business and as such the mark-to-market value of these contracts is not reflected in the financial statements. however, the mark-to-market value of these contracts is considered when committing to new business from a credit perspective. at year-end, ppl energy supply had a credit exposure of $678 million to energy trading partners. the majority of this amount was the mark-to-market value of multi-year contracts for energy sales. therefore, if the counterparties fail to perform their obligations, ppl energy supply would not experience an immediate financial loss, but would experience lower revenues in future years to the extent that replacement sales could not be made at the same prices as the defaulted contracts. of the $678 million, five counterparties account for 80% of the exposure. no other individual counterparty accounted for more than 2% of the exposure. the largest exposure, $206 million, was to ppl electric, under the long-term contract to provide ppl electric's plr load. ppl electric has posted collateral in an amount of $56 million related to this exposure in accordance with its contract with ppl energy supply. the other four counterparties have an "investment grade" credit rating from standard &amp; poors with the exception of one counterparty that is a governmental agency and as such is not rated. with the exception of the governmental agency, ppl energy supply has the right to request collateral from each of these counterparties in the event their credit rating falls below investment grade. it is also ppl energy supply's policy to enter into netting agreements with each of its counterparties to minimize credit exposure. sales to california independent system operator and to other pacific northwest purchasers ppl energy supply, through ppl montana, has made approximately $18 million of sales to the california iso, for which ppl energy supply has not yet been paid in full. given the myriad of electricity supply problems presently faced by the california electric utilities and the california iso, ppl energy supply cannot predict whether or when it will receive payment. as of december 31, 2001, ppl energy supply has fully reserved for possible underrecoveries of payments for these sales. litigation arising out of the california electric supply situation has been filed at the ferc and in california courts against sellers of energy to the california iso. the plaintiffs and intervenors in these proceedings allege abuses of market power, manipulation of market prices, unfair trade practices and violations of state antitrust laws, among other things, and seek price caps on wholesale sales in california and other western power markets, refunds of excess profits allegedly earned on these sales of energy, and other relief, including treble damages and attorneys' fees. certain of ppl energy supply's subsidiaries have intervened in the ferc proceedings in order to protect their interests, but have not been named as defendants in any of the court actions alleging abuses of market power, manipulation of market prices, unfair trade practices and violations of state antitrust laws. ppl montana has been named as a defendant in a declaratory judgment action initiated by the state of california to prevent certain members of the california power exchange from seeking compensation for the state's seizure of certain energy contracts. ppl montana is a member of the california power exchange, but it has no energy contracts with or through the california power exchange and has not sought compensation in connection with the state's seizure. attorneys general in several western states, including california, have begun investigations related to the electricity supply situation in california and other western states. the ferc has determined that all sellers of energy in the california markets, including ppl montana, should be subject to refund liability for the period beginning october 2, 2000 through june 20, 2001 and has initiated an evidentiary hearing concerning refund amounts. the ferc also is considering whether to order refunds for sales made in the pacific northwest, including sales made by ppl montana. the ferc administrative law judge assigned to this proceeding has recommended that no refunds be ordered for sales into the pacific northwest. the ferc presently is considering this recommendation. ppl energy supply and ppl montana cannot predict whether or the extent to which any of its subsidiaries will be the target of any governmental investigation or named in these lawsuits, refund proceedings or other lawsuits, the outcome of any such proceedings or whether the ultimate impact on ppl montana of the electricity supply situation in california and other western states will be material. enron bankruptcy in connection with the december 2, 2001 bankruptcy filings by enron corporation and its affiliates ("enron"), certain ppl energy supply subsidiaries have terminated certain electricity and gas agreements with enron. ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries' 2001 earnings exposure associated with termination of these contracts was approximately $8 million after-tax, and is recorded in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" and "energy purchases" on the statement of income. additionally, certain of these contracts with enron extended through 2006, and were at prices more favorable to ppl energy supply than current market prices. however, there is no further accounting charge to be recorded. ppl expects to make a claim in enron's bankruptcy proceeding with respect to all amounts payable by enron resulting from the termination of these contracts. write-down of international energy projects ppl global has a 51% economic interest in wpd 1953, a 15.4% equity investor in teeside power limited, the owner of the 1,875 mw teesside power station, located in northeast england. through its european affiliates, enron was an owner, the operator and power purchaser of the station's output. as a result of enron being placed into receivership in the u.k. and its default on obligations under the power purchase agreements, wpd 1953 wrote off its entire equity investment in teesside power limited. ppl global's share of the impairment loss was $21 million and is included in "write-down of international energy projects," a component of "other charges" on the statement of income. in connection with the enron bankruptcy and the probable resulting loss of teesside cash flows, ppl and its subsidiaries evaluated the carrying value of the investment in wpd 1953 and wpdl. fair value, measured using discounted cash flows, was compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment existed at december 31, 2001. fair value was determined considering the loss of the value of the future cash flows from the teesside power station and a forecasted reduction in future operating cash flows at wpd 1953 and wpdl. the probability-weighted impairment loss was $117 million, after-tax. the pre-tax charge was $134 million, and was recorded as a charge to "write-down of international energy projects." ppl global owns 89.6% of cemar, which distributes and sells electricity in brazil, under a 30-year concession agreement with the government. the combined effects of growth in demand, decreased rainfall on the country's heavily hydroelectric-dependent generating capacity and delays in the development of new non-hydroelectric generation have led to shortages of electricity in certain regions. as a result, the brazilian government implemented countrywide electricity rationing in mid-2001. in addition, the wholesale energy markets in brazil have been substantially disrupted. cemar's results of operations, its cash flows, and its continued ability to meet its financial obligations have deteriorated due to the continuing impact of the electricity rationing, the disruption in the energy markets, the failure of the electricity regulator to adequately address these problems, the resulting effects on the brazilian capital markets and related factors. in december 2001 and january 2002, the brazilian electricity regulator issued tariff rulings that cemar believes are inadequate to compensate for cemar's rationing-related losses and to meet its ongoing operational and financial requirements. moreover, cemar believes that these tariff rulings demonstrate that the regulator may not take the necessary steps to resolve the current problems in a satisfactory manner. in addition, the brazilian wholesale energy markets continue to be disrupted and recent actions by the electricity regulator indicate that adequate compensation to cemar for its transactions in that market may not be made. finally, the continued problems in the brazilian energy market and the lack of appropriate regulatory actions have significantly decreased the availability of local financing for cemar. as a result of the above events, ppl global estimates that the long-term viability of the cemar operation is jeopardized and that there is minimal probability of positive future cash flows. consequently, at december 31, 2001, ppl global recorded an impairment loss in the carrying value of its net assets in cemar of $179 million, reflected in "write-down of international energy projects." in addition, cemar increased its valuation allowance in deferred tax assets, thereby recording $44 million in additional foreign deferred income taxes. a related $6 million credit to "minority interest" was also reflected on the statement of income. the net result of these transactions was a $217 million charge to earnings. ppl global currently anticipates writing off the remaining portion of its cemar investment, approximately $100 million, in 2002. as a result of the financial difficulties discussed above, cemar has failed to pay certain of its creditors for obligations when due. cemar is currently in discussions with creditors, governmental officials, regulators and other parties to address these problems. in addition, cemar expects that it will not be in compliance with the financial covenants in its $150 million debenture indenture when it closes its books for the quarter ended december 31, 2001. in that case, cemar will be required to notify the indenture agent. in accordance with the indenture, the agent will call a meeting of the holders of the debentures within three business days of the notice to hold a vote regarding the acceleration of the debentures. unless three-fourths of the holders vote against acceleration, the agent will be obligated under the indenture to accelerate the debentures. cemar expects the required notice to the indenture agent to occur in the first quarter of 2002. schedule ii - valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves

(f) after the july 1, 2000, corporate realignment, ppl electric only has wholesale sales to municipalities and nug purchases that are resold to ppl energyplus. (g) comparability of selected financial and operating data for 2001 and 2000 to prior years is affected by the corporate realignment on july 1, 2000, in which ppl electric transferred its electric generation and related assets to ppl and its affiliates. (see note 12 to the financial statements for additional discussion.) ppl electric utilities corporation item 7. review of the financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following discussion explains significant changes in principal items on the statement of income comparing 2001 to 2000, and 2000 to 1999. certain items on the statement of income have been impacted by the corporate realignment undertaken by ppl and ppl electric effective july 1, 2000. see note 12 to the financial statements for information regarding the corporate realignment. the statement of income of ppl electric for 2001 and the last six months of 2000 include the results of its post-realignment activities (the transmission and distribution of electricity in its service territory and the supply of electricity as a plr in this territory under pennsylvania's customer choice act). the results for the first six months of 2000 and the entire year 1999 also include ppl electric's former electric generation and unregulated wholesale and retail marketing functions. the following adjustments are made when comparing results of operations, to make the periods more comparable: when comparing 2001 with 2000, the estimated results of operations of the electric generation and unregulated marketing assets for the first six months of 2000 are eliminated for purposes of comparability. when comparing 2000 with 1999, the estimated results of operations of the electric generation and unregulated marketing assets during the second half of 1999 are eliminated for purposes of comparability. earnings the earnings of ppl electric were impacted by several unusual items. refer to specific notes to the financial statements for discussion of certain of these unusual items. the unusual items without note references are discussed in "other income - net" and "other operation expenses." (millions of dollars) 2001 2000 1999 net income $ 119 $ 261 $ 398 unusual items (net of tax): accounting method change - pensions (note 9) 5 environmental insurance recoveries 24 sale of sunbury plant and related assets 42 securitization (note 2) 19 net income from core operations $ 114 $ 237 $ 337 the decrease in net income from core operations in 2001 compared with 2000 was primarily due to the corporate realignment completed on july 1, 2000. after eliminating the estimated results of the electric generation and marketing assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results of the first half of 2000, comparable earnings for 2000 would have been an estimated $68 million. the $114 million earnings from core operations for 2001 were $46 million higher than the comparable earnings for 2000. this increase was primarily the effect of: higher delivery revenues due to a 2.1% increase in sales; lower interest expense due to lower short-term debt levels; and lower operating costs, including lower pension expense; partially offset by higher taxes other than income, due to credits for purta and local property tax accruals, recorded in 2000. the decrease in net income from core operations in 2000 compared with 1999 was primarily due to the corporate realignment. after eliminating the estimated results of the electric generation and marketing assets from the earnings in the second half of 1999, comparable earnings for 1999 would have been an estimated $228 million. the $237 million adjusted earnings for 2000 were $9 million higher than the comparable earnings for 1999. this increase was primarily the effect of: higher margins on wholesale energy transactions; the end of the one-year 4% rate reduction for delivery customers; a 2.6% increase in electric delivery sales; and gains on sales of emission allowances and lower pension expenses; partially offset by higher interest expense and income taxes, and the write-off of a regulatory asset for the loss incurred in the retail access pilot program. operating revenues retail electric the increase (decrease) in retail revenues from electric operations was attributable to the following changes (millions of dollars): 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs.1999 ppl electric electric delivery $ 12 $ 28 plr electric generation supply 284 32 ppl energyplus electric generation supply (259 ) (155 ) other (4 ) 6 $ 33 $ (89 ) after eliminating the revenues of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the first half of 2000, retail electric revenues increased by $292 million in 2001 compared to 2000. this increase in revenues was primarily due to: higher ppl electric revenues as a plr resulting from the return of shoppers due to fewer alternate suppliers under the customer choice act, and a decreased emphasis on the retail supply business by ppl energyplus; and increased deliveries of electricity, primarily in commercial and residential markets. after eliminating the revenues of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the second half of 1999, operating revenues from retail electric operations increased by $150 million during 2000 compared with 1999. this was primarily due to an increase in ppl energyplus' supply volumes in the first half of 2000 compared with the same period in 1999. also contributing to the increase were higher ppl electric retail delivery and plr supply sales in 2000. this was due to increased usage by commercial and residential customers and fewer service territory customers selecting a supplier other than ppl electric. pursuant to the customer choice act and a restructuring settlement with the puc, ppl electric is required, through 2009, to provide electricity at pre-determined prices to its delivery customers who do not select an alternate supplier. while these supply rates vary by customer class, the settlement provides for average rates ranging from 4.16 cents per kwh in 2001, increasing to 5.02 per kwh in 2009. as part of this settlement agreement, ppl electric also agreed to a cap on its average transmission and distribution rates of 1.74 cents per kwh through 2004. wholesale energy marketing and trading the increase (decrease) in revenues from wholesale energy marketing and trading activities was attributable to the following (millions of dollars): 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 bilateral sales $ (519 ) $ (337 ) pjm (64 ) (44 ) cost-based contracts (46 ) (85 ) gas &amp; oil sales (149 ) (143 ) nug purchases sold to ppl energyplus 92 84 other 5 (5 ) $ (681 ) $ (530 ) after eliminating the revenues of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the first half of 2000, and making other pro-forma adjustments, wholesale revenues increased by $17 million during 2001 compared with 2000. this increase was primarily due to the sale of power (purchased from nugs) to ppl energyplus. after eliminating the revenues of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the second half of 1999, wholesale energy marketing and trading revenues increased by $153 million in 2000 compared with 1999. this increase was primarily due to increased bilateral sales revenues due to higher market pricing and increased sales volumes to other counterparties. in 2001 and going forward, ppl electric wholesale sales are and will be derived solely from nug purchases that ppl electric resells to ppl energyplus and sales to municipalities. fuel effective with the july 1, 2000 corporate realignment, the generation of electricity, and the acquisition of fuel for that generation, was transferred to ppl generation. electric fuel costs decreased by $245 million in 2000 compared with 1999. after eliminating the expenses associated with assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the second half of 1999, electric fuel costs decreased by $20 million in 2000 compared with 1999. this decrease was attributed to lower generation because of the holtwood plant closing and the sale of the sunbury plant in 1999, plant outages and reduced operation of less economical units. lower nuclear fuel expense also contributed to the decrease in electric fuel costs. during the first quarter of 1999, there was a charge of $5 million to accrue for the increase in estimated costs for dry cask canisters for on-site spent fuel storage at the susquehanna plant. energy purchases energy purchases increased by $93 million in 2001 compared with 2000. after eliminating the expenses associated with assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the first half of 2000, energy purchases increased by $290 million during 2001 compared with 2000. the increase reflects higher purchases of electricity from ppl energyplus to meet ppl electric's higher plr obligation. energy purchases increased by $22 million in 2000 compared with 1999. after eliminating the expenses of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the second half of 1999, energy purchases increased by $301 million during 2000 compared with 1999. during the first half of 2000, energy purchases increased by $166 million over the same period in 1999. this was primarily due to higher purchases to support ppl energyplus' increased unregulated retail electric and gas sales. also, higher per-unit prices for these purchases contributed to the increase in energy purchases, coupled with recognized losses on certain long-term forward transactions. the remainder of the increase during 2000, $135 million, represents the estimated increase in ppl electric's purchases to support its plr load in the second half of 2000, as noted above. amortization of recoverable transition costs amortization of recoverable transition costs increased by $24 million in 2001 compared with 2000. this increase was primarily due to the collection of ctc revenues related to prior year ctc deferrals of amounts in excess of the rate cap. the increase also reflects higher amortization of intangible transition property due to lower interest expense on the transition bonds. amortization of recoverable transition costs increased by $33 million in 2000 compared with 1999. this increase was the result of recording twelve months of amortization in 2000 as compared to five months of amortization recorded in 1999. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in ctc revenues related to a deferral of ctc amounts in excess of the rate cap. other operation expenses other operation expenses decreased by $123 million in 2001 compared with 2000. after eliminating the expenses of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the first half of 2000, other operation expenses increased by $3 million in 2001 compared with 2000. this increase was primarily due to an insurance settlement for environmental liability coverage recorded in 2000 (as a reduction of expenses), partially offset by lower pension expense and lower corporate expenses from ppl services. other operation expenses decreased by $237 million from 1999 to 2000. after eliminating the expenses of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the second half of 1999, other operation expenses decreased by $86 million during 2000 compared with 1999. this decrease was primarily the result of environmental insurance recoveries, gains on the sale of emission allowances and a decrease in pension costs, offset by increased costs of wages and benefits. maintenance expenses maintenance expenses decreased by $96 million in 2001 compared with 2000. after eliminating the expenses of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the first half of 2000, maintenance expenses decreased by $15 million in 2001 when compared with 2000. this decrease was primarily the result of allocating more rents for office space to the user business lines in 2001 compared to 2000, as well as lower overhead line maintenance. maintenance expenses decreased by $54 million in 2000 compared with 1999. after eliminating the expenses associated with assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the second half of 1999, maintenance expenses were unchanged during 2000 compared with 1999. depreciation depreciation decreased by $76 million in 2001 compared with 2000. after eliminating the expenses of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the first half of 2000, depreciation decreased by $8 million during 2001 compared with 2000. this decrease reflects a change in life characteristics for transmission and distribution property. depreciation decreased by $66 million in 2000 compared with 1999. after eliminating the expenses of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the second half of 1999, depreciation decreased by $3 million from 1999 to 2000. taxes, other than income taxes, other than income, decreased by $18 million in 2001 compared with 2000. after eliminating the expenses of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from results for the first half of 2000, taxes, other than income increased by $12 million. this increase was primarily due to credits to purta and local property tax accruals recorded in the third quarter of 2000. other income - net other income decreased by $80 million in 2000 compared with 1999. after eliminating the other income of assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the second half of 1999 (including a $66 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the sunbury plant and related assets), other income decreased by $28 million during 2000 compared with 1999. this decrease was primarily due to a charge of $12 million resulting from a puc ruling requiring the write-off of the regulatory asset for the loss incurred in pennsylvania's retail access pilot program, and an adverse ferc decision regarding investments in pjm. financing costs interest expense decreased by $9 million in 2001 compared with 2000. this decrease was primarily the result of lower outstanding commercial paper and intercompany borrowings. interest expense increased by $25 million in 2000 compared with 1999. interest on long-term debt increased by $17 million. this increase was primarily associated with the issuance of transition bonds by ppl transition bond company in august 1999, offset by retirements of mortgage bonds. interest on short-term debt increased by $8 million. this change was primarily due to an increase in intercompany loans outstanding and a reduction in afudc in 2000. dividends on preferred securities decreased by $11 million from 1999 to 2000. this decrease was the result of ppl electric's repurchase of preferred stock held by ppl. income taxes income tax expense decreased by $106 million in 2001 compared with 2000. after eliminating the estimated income associated with assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the first half of 2000, income taxes increased by $2 million during 2001 compared with 2000. this reflects an increase in pro-forma pre-tax book income. income tax expense increased by $20 million in 2000 compared with 1999. after eliminating the estimated income associated with assets transferred in the corporate realignment from the results for the second half of 1999, income taxes increased by $68 million during 2000 compared with 1999. this increase was primarily due to a release of deferred taxes no longer required due to securitization, recognized in the third quarter of 1999. financial condition liquidity at december 31, 2001, ppl electric's net cash position was $79 million, consisting entirely of cash and cash equivalents and no short-term debt. cash and cash equivalents are derived from cash from operations, cash from financing activities and cash from investing activities. ppl electric derives steady cash flows from operations through the delivery of electricity to customers over transmission and distribution networks. in 2001, ppl electric signed a full requirements contract with ppl energyplus to meet its plr requirements through 2009, in order to eliminate the energy price exposure associated with purchasing energy in the open market to meet plr load. cash from operations in 2001 was $392 million compared to $803 million in 2000. the decrease was primarily due to the corporate realignment completed in july 2000 which transferred certain generation and related assets and associated liabilities to ppl and its unregulated subsidiaries. net cash used in financing activities was $148 million in 2001 and $519 million in 2000. the primary uses of cash in financing activities in 2001 were the retirement of ppl electric's long-term debt, the repurchase of its common stock from ppl and the payment of dividends. a commercial paper program at ppl electric totaling $400 million is maintained to meet short-term cash needs. the amount of commercial paper that could be outstanding under ppl electric's program is limited to the amount of its unused credit line. if the existing credit ratings of these commercial paper program ratings were lowered, it is unlikely that there would be sufficient investor demand for the commercial paper and ppl electric would have to borrow against its unsecured credit line if internal cash flows were insufficient to meet short-term cash needs. ppl electric maintains an unsecured credit line of $402 million that is available as a backstop for its commercial paper program or for direct borrowings. the credit line is also available to issue up to $200 million in letters of credit that may be needed for credit enhancements and margin requirements resulting from ppl electric's plr energy contract with ppl energyplus or other contracting activities. ppl electric's maximum collateral requirement associated with the plr contract is $300 million. in january 2002, ppl electric provided ppl energyplus with cash collateral of $56 million. this credit line contains financial and other covenants that if not met, would limit or restrict the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit or cause early payment of outstanding borrowings. at this time, ppl electric believes that these covenants will not limit access to these funding sources. under its credit line, ppl electric must maintain a debt to capitalization percentage not greater than 70%. at december 31, 2001 and december 31, 2000, ppl electric's debt to total capitalization percentage, as developed in accordance with its credit line, was 57% and 43%, respectively. ppl electric also has available funding sources that are provided through off-balance sheet leasing arrangements. these financing arrangements provide funds for equipment such as computers, vehicles and tools. as of december 31, 2001, ppl electric had approximately $90 million of funding capacity available to it through those leasing arrangements. these financing arrangements contain covenants that, if not met, could limit or restrict access to these funds or require early payment of obligations. at this time, ppl electric believes that these covenants will not limit access to these funding sources. at december 31, 2001, the estimated contractual cash obligations of ppl electric were as follows (in millions): contractual cash obligations total less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years after 5 years long-term debt (a) $ 3,467 $ 274 $ 939 $ 1,033 $ 1,221 capital lease obligations operating leases 98 29 31 20 18 unconditional purchase obligations other long-term obligations 1,206 165 497 331 213 total contractual cash obligations $ 4,771 $ 468 $ 1,467 $ 1,384 $ 1,452 (a) includes $1.9 billion of transition bonds issued by ppl transition bond company in 1999 to securitize a portion of ppl electric's stranded costs. this debt is non-recourse to ppl electric. at december 31, 2001, ppl electric provided a guarantee in the amount of $7 million in support of safe harbor water power corporation, in which ppl electric had an ownership interest prior to the corporate realignment. at december 31, 2001, the estimated commercial commitments of ppl electric were as follows (in millions): amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amounts committed less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years over 5 years lines of credit (a) standby letters of credit draws under lines of credit guarantees debt $ 7 $ 7 performance standby repurchase obligations other commercial commitments total commercial commitments $ 7 $ 7 (a) available credit facilities of $402 million. terms governing the various securities issued by ppl electric contain financial and other covenants that require compliance in order to avoid defaults and accelerations of payments. at this time, ppl electric believes that it will be able to meet these covenant requirements. in order to meet its maturing obligations in future years, ppl electric expects that it will have to continue to access both the bank and capital securities markets. the long-term debt and similar securities and their maturities are included in the table of contractual cash obligations above. net cash used in investing activities in 2001 was $432 million, compared to $69 million in 2000. the increase in 2001 was primarily the result of a loan to ppl and affiliates. in 2002, ppl electric's expenditures for property, plant and equipment are expected to increase primarily to accommodate an automated meter reading project initiated in late 2001. ppl electric anticipates that its capital requirements will be funded from cash on hand, loan repayments from affiliates and cash from operations in 2002. energy marketing and trading activities in connection with the corporate realignment, effective july 1, 2000, ppl electric's unregulated energy marketing and trading activities were transferred to ppl energyplus. related party transactions ppl electric is not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management of ppl electric or its subsidiaries in outside partnerships or other entities doing business with ppl electric. for additional information on related party transactions, see note 11 to the financial statements. capital expenditure requirements the schedule below shows ppl electric's current capital expenditure projections for the years 2002-2006 and actual spending for the year 2001 (millions of dollars): actual projected 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 construction expenditures transmission and distribution facilities $ 124 $ 213 $ 219 $ 192 $ 163 $ 182 environmental other 29 22 22 22 22 22 total capital expenditures $ 153 $ 235 $ 241 $ 214 $ 185 $ 204 construction expenditures include afudc which is expected to be less than $4 million in each of the years 2002-2006. ppl electric's capital expenditure projections for the years 2002-2006 total about $1.1 billion. capital expenditure plans are revised from time-to-time to reflect changes in conditions. cash flow cash and cash equivalents decreased by $403 million more during 2001 compared with 2000. the reasons for this change were: a $411 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities, primarily due to the operating income of assets transferred in the corporate realignment. this decrease also reflects the $90 million up-front payment made to ppl energyplus under the long-term energy supply contract. a $363 million increase in cash used in investing activities, primarily due to an increase in net loans to parent and affiliates, offset by lower expenditures for property, plant and equipment due to the transfer of generating assets in the corporate realignment. a $371 million decrease in cash used in financing activities. this reflects the issuance of the senior secured bonds in 2001, net of cash used to repurchase common stock from ppl. environmental matters see note 10 to the financial statements for a discussion of environmental matters. competition the electric utility industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, an increase in the level of competition in the energy supply market at both the state and federal levels. ppl electric's plr supply business will be affected by customers who select alternate suppliers under the customer choice act. in july 2001, the ferc issued orders calling for the formation of one rto throughout the mid-atlantic region (pjm), new york and new england. in response, ppl electric is taking the position that a single northeastern rto is a significant step forward in establishing a reliable and properly functioning wholesale electricity market in the region. ppl electric strongly supports the most comprehensive amalgamation of the existing and proposed northeast power pools, including the establishment of a single rto as well as the elimination of marketplace distinctions and control area boundaries. the ferc's northeastern rto proceeding is continuing. critical accounting policies ppl electric's financial condition and results of operations are necessarily impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations of ppl electric, and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain. changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements. (these accounting policies are also discussed in note 1 to the financial statements.) 1) pension and other postretirement benefits as described in note 9, ppl electric participates in, and is allocated a share of the liability and net periodic pension cost of the ppl retirement plan and the ppl postretirement benefit plan. ppl follows the guidance of sfas 87, "employers' accounting for pension" and sfas 106, "employers' accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions" for these benefits. under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. delayed recognition of differences between actual results and those assumed is a guiding principle of these standards. this allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. the primary assumptions are as follows: discount rate - the discount rate is used to record the value of benefits, which are based on future projections, in terms of today's dollars. expected return on plan assets - management projects the future return on plan assets based principally on prior performance. the projected future value of assets reduces the benefit obligation a company will record. rate of compensation increase - management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement. health care cost trend - management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care. amortization of gains/(losses) - management can select the method by which gains or losses are recognized in financial results. these gains or losses are created when actual results differ from estimated results based on the above assumptions. at december 31, 2001, ppl electric had been allocated accrued pension and postretirement liabilities of $71 million. these liabilities are included in &quot;deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities - other&quot; on the balance sheet. during 2001, ppl made changes to its assumptions related to the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the method of amortization of gains/(losses). a variance in the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase or amortization method could have a significant impact on the pension costs recorded under sfas 87. a variance in the health care cost trend assumption could have a significant impact on costs recorded under sfas 106 for postretirement medical expense. 2) contingencies ppl electric periodically records the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes. these events are called "contingencies," and ppl electric's accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas 5, "accounting for contingencies." sfas 5 defines a contingency as "an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur." sfas 5 does not permit the accrual of gain contingencies under any circumstances. for loss contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that it is probable that the loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events; and (2) that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. the accrual of a contingency involves considerable judgment on the part of management. ppl electric uses its internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers, tax specialists and engineers), as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss. the largest contingency on ppl electric's balance sheet had been the loss accrual for above market nug purchase commitments, being the difference between the above market contract terms and the fair value of the energy. this loss accrual of $854 million was recorded in 1998, when ppl electric's generation business was deregulated. under regulatory accounting, ppl electric recorded the above market cost of the purchases from nugs as part of its purchased power costs on an as-incurred basis, since these costs were recovered in regulated rates. when the generation business was deregulated, the loss contingency associated with the commitment to make above market nug purchases was recorded. this loss accrual for the above market portion of nug purchase commitments was recorded because it was probable the loss had been incurred and the estimate of future energy prices could be reasonably determined, using forward pricing information. this loss accrual was transferred to ppl energyplus in the july 1, 2000 corporate realignment. ppl electric has also recorded contingencies for uncollectible accounts, environmental remediation, taxes and litigation in situations where management determined it was probable a loss had been incurred and it could be reasonably estimated. item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments commodity price risk ppl electric and ppl energyplus had a long-term power supply agreement under which ppl energyplus sold to ppl electric, at a predetermined pricing arrangement, energy, capacity and ancillary services to fulfill ppl electric's plr obligation through 2001. ppl energyplus has contracted to supply ppl electric with long-term power for the period 2002 through 2009. as a result, ppl electric has shifted any electric price risk relating to its plr obligation to ppl energyplus for 2001 through 2009. interest rate risk ppl electric has issued debt to finance its operations, which increases interest rate risk. ppl electric's potential annual exposure to increased interest expense, based on a 10% increase in interest rates, was not significant at december 31, 2001, compared to $2 million at december 31, 2000. ppl electric is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its debt portfolio. at december 31, 2001, ppl electric estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its debt portfolio, through a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, was approximately $56 million, compared to $20 million at december 31, 2000. market events that are inconsistent with historical trends could cause actual results to differ from estimated levels. nuclear decommissioning fund - securities price risk in connection with the corporate realignment, effective july 1, 2000, the nuclear decommissioning fund was transferred to, and will be maintained by, ppl susquehanna. report of independent accountants to the board of directors and shareowner of ppl electric utilities corporation: in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under item 14(a)(1) on page 176 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ppl electric utilities corporation and its subsidiaries (&quot;ppl electric&quot;) at december 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 14(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. these financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of ppl electric's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the united states of america, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. as discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, ppl electric changed its method of accounting for amortizing unrecognized gains or losses in the annual pension expense/income determined under statement of financial accounting standards no. 87, employers' accounting for pensions. pricewaterhousecoopers llp philadelphia, pa february 4, 2002 ppl electric utilities corporation management's report on responsibility for financial statements the management of ppl electric is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the consolidated financial statements and all other sections of this annual report. the financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and the uniform system of accounts prescribed by the federal energy regulatory commission for regulated businesses. in preparing the financial statements, management makes informed estimates and judgments of the expected effects of events and transactions based upon currently available facts and circumstances. management believes that the financial statements are free of material misstatement and present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of ppl electric. ppl electric's consolidated financial statements have been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers, llp (pwc) independent certified public accountants. pwc's appointment as auditors was previously ratified by the shareowners of ppl. management has made available to pwc all ppl electric's financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of shareowner's and directors' meetings. management believes that all representations made to pwc during its audit were valid and appropriate. ppl electric maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance as to the integrity and reliability of the financial statements, the protection of assets from unauthorized use or disposition and the prevention and detection of fraudulent financial reporting. the concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a system of internal control should not exceed the benefits derived and that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control. fundamental to the control system is the selection and training of qualified personnel, an organizational structure that provides appropriate segregation of duties, the utilization of written policies and procedures and the continual monitoring of the system for compliance. in addition, ppl maintains an internal auditing program to evaluate ppl electric's system of internal control for adequacy, application and compliance. management considers the internal auditors' and pwc's recommendations concerning its system of internal control and has taken actions which are believed to be cost-effective in the circumstances to respond appropriately to these recommendations. management believes that ppl electric's system of internal control is adequate to accomplish the objectives discussed in this report. the board of directors, acting through ppl's audit committee, oversees management's responsibilities in the preparation of the financial statements. in performing this function, the audit committee, which is composed of four independent directors, meets periodically with management, the internal auditors and pwc to review the work of each. pwc and the internal auditors have free access to ppl's audit committee and to the board of directors, without management present, to discuss internal accounting control, auditing and financial reporting matters. management also recognizes its responsibility for fostering a strong ethical climate so that ppl electric's affairs are conducted according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. this responsibility is characterized and reflected in ppl electric's business policies and guidelines. these policies and guidelines address: the necessity of ensuring open communication within ppl electric; potential conflicts of interest; proper procurement activities; compliance with all applicable laws, including those relating to financial disclosure; and the confidentiality of proprietary information. michael e. bray vice chair and president joseph j. mccabe vice president and controller item 8. financial statements and supplementary data consolidated statement of income for the years ended december 31, ppl electric utilities corporation and subsidiaries (millions of dollars) 2001 2000 1999 operating revenues retail electric $ 2,457 $ 2,424 $ 2,513 wholesale energy marketing and trading 209 890 1,420 energy related businesses 28 22 19 total 2,694 3,336 3,952 operating expenses operation fuel 200 445 energy purchases 1,502 1,409 1,387 other 237 360 597 amortization of recoverable transition costs 251 227 194 maintenance 51 147 201 depreciation (note 1) 91 167 233 taxes, other than income (note 4) 116 134 129 energy related businesses 27 23 17 total 2,275 2,667 3,203 operating income 419 669 749 other income - net 16 17 97 income before interest expense 435 686 846 interest expense 230 239 214 income before income taxes 205 447 632 income taxes (note 4) 65 171 151 income before extraordinary items 140 276 481 extraordinary items (net of income taxes) (note 2) 11 (46) income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 140 287 435 cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of income taxes) (note 9) 5 income before dividends on preferred securities 145 287 435 dividends - preferred securities 26 26 37 net income $ 119 $ 261 $ 398 the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of the financial statements. consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december 31, ppl electric utilities corporation and subsidiaries (millions of dollars) 2001 2000 1999 cash flows from operating activities net income $ 119 $ 261 $ 398 extraordinary items (net of income taxes) 11 (46) net income before extraordinary items 119 250 444 adjustments to reconcile net income before extraordinary items to net cash provided by operating activities depreciation 91 167 233 amortizations - recoverable transition costs and other 260 189 149 gain on sale of generating assets (65) nuclear fuel amortization 28 59 dividend requirements - preferred securities 26 26 37 deferred income taxes and investment tax credits 31 (9) (73) prepayment on plr energy supply from affiliate (90) pension expense (income) (24) (4) 6 cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (5) change in current assets and current liabilities accounts receivable (76) (22) 44 accounts payable 113 192 (106) other - net (41) (1) (11) other operating activities - net (12) (13) (72) net cash provided by operating activities 392 803 645 cash flows from investing activities expenditures for property, plant and equipment (134) (242) (300) loan to parent and affiliates - net (280) 142 (60) sale of generating assets 99 sale of nuclear fuel to trust 27 14 other investing activities - net (18) 4 1 net cash used in investing activities (432) (69) (246) cash flows from financing activities issuance of long-term debt 800 2,419 retirement of long-term debt (465) (380) (1,497) purchase of treasury stock (280) (632) retirement of preferred stock (15) (380) payments on capital lease obligations (11) (59) payment of common and preferred dividends (107) (140) (231) termination of nuclear fuel lease (154) cash of subsidiaries divested in corporate realignment (note 12) (73) net increase (decrease) in short-term debt (59) 239 92 other financing activities - net (22) (90) net cash used in financing activities (148) (519) (378) net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (188) 215 21 cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 267 52 31 cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 79 $ 267 $ 52 supplemental disclosures of cash flow information cash paid during the period for: interest (net of amount capitalized) $ 50 $ 227 $ 202 income taxes $ 63 $ 91 $ 192 the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of the financial statements. consolidated balance sheet at december 31, ppl electric utilities corporation and subsidiaries (millions of dollars) 2001 2000 assets current assets cash and cash equivalents (note 1) $ 79 $ 267 accounts receivable (less reserve: 2001, $19;

energy funding, ppl electric, ppl gas utilities, ppl services and ppl capital funding. ppl electric is the principal utility subsidiary of ppl. ppl electric's principal businesses are the transmission and distribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central pennsylvania, and the supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a plr. the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ppl electric and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. see note 12 for information on the corporate realignment. use of estimates/contingencies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u. s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. ppl electric records loss contingencies in accordance with sfas 5, "accounting for contingencies." accounting records the accounting records for ppl electric are maintained in accordance with the uniform system of accounts prescribed by the ferc and adopted by the puc. regulation historically, ppl electric accounted for its regulated operations in accordance with the provisions of sfas 71, "accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation," which requires rate-regulated entities to reflect the effects of regulatory decisions in their financial statements. ppl electric discontinued application of sfas 71 for the generation portion of its business, effective june 30, 1998. in connection with the corporate realignment, effective july 1, 2000, the generating and certain other related assets, along with associated liabilities, were contributed to new unregulated subsidiaries of ppl generation. ppl electric's remaining regulated business continues to be subject to sfas 71. property, plant and equipment following are the classes of electric utility plant in service with the associated accumulated depreciation at december 31 (millions of dollars): 2001 2000 transmission and distribution $ 3,609 $ 3,521 general 312 309 3,921 3,830 less: accumulated depreciation 1,512 1,467 $ 2,409 $ 2,363 property, plant and equipment at december 31, 2001 is recorded at original cost. original cost includes material, labor, contractor costs, construction overheads and afudc. when a component of regulated property, plant or equipment is retired, the original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods. the annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: transmission and distribution, 15-80 years, and general, 10-80 years. ppl electric periodically reviews and adjusts the depreciable lives of its fixed assets if approved by regulators. recoverable transition costs based on the puc final order, ppl electric was amortizing its competitive transition (or stranded) costs over an eleven-year transition period effective january 1, 1999. in august 1999, competitive transition costs of $2.4 billion were converted to intangible transition costs when securitized by the issuance of transition bonds. the intangible transition costs are being amortized over the life of the transition bonds, august 1999 through december 2008, in accordance with an amortization schedule filed with the puc. the assets of ppl transition bond company, including the intangible transition property, are not available to creditors of ppl or ppl electric. the transition bonds are obligations of ppl transition bond company and are non-recourse to ppl and ppl electric. the remaining competitive transition costs are also being amortized based on an amortization schedule previously filed with the puc, adjusted for those competitive transition costs that were converted to intangible transition costs. as a result of the conversion of a significant portion of the competitive transition costs into intangible transition costs, amortization of substantially all of the remaining competitive transition costs will occur in 2009. revenue recognition "retail electric" and "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues are recorded based on deliveries through the end of the calendar month. unbilled retail revenues result because customers meters are read and bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than all being read at the end of the month. unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kwh by the estimated average cents per kwh. income taxes the provision for ppl electric's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the puc and the ferc. the difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under u.s. gaap is deferred and included in taxes recoverable through future rates in "regulatory and other noncurrent assets - other" on the balance sheet. see note 4 for additional information. ppl electric deferred investment tax credits when they were utilized, and is amortizing the deferrals over the average lives of the related assets. ppl electric and its subsidiaries are included in the consolidated federal income tax return of ppl. leases ppl electric applies the provisions of sfas 13, "accounting for leases," to all leasing transactions. in addition, ppl electric applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for leases. payments on leased property, classified as operating leases, are estimated as follows (millions of dollars): 2002, $29; 2003, $18; 2004, $13; 2005, $11; and 2006, $9; and thereafter, $18. these leases include vehicles, personal computers and other equipment. pension and postretirement benefits see note 9 for discussion on accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. cash equivalents all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. treasury stock treasury shares are reflected on the balance sheet as an offset to common equity under the cost method of accounting. management has no definitive plans for the future use of these shares. reclassification certain amounts in the 2000 and 1999 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. extraordinary items in august 1999, ppl transition bond company issued $2.4 billion of transition bonds to securitize a portion of ppl electric's stranded costs. ppl electric used a portion of the securitization proceeds to repurchase $1.5 billion of its first mortgage bonds. the premiums and related expenses to reacquire these bonds were $59 million, net of tax. ppl electric's customers will benefit from securitization through an expected average rate reduction of approximately one percent for the period the transition bonds are outstanding. with securitization, a substantial portion of the ctc has been replaced with an itc, which passes 75% of the net financing savings back to customers. in august 1999, ppl electric released approximately $78 million of deferred income taxes associated with the ctc that was no longer required because of securitization. the net securitization impact of the bond repurchase and the deferred tax change was a gain of $19 million. sfas 4, "reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt,'' requires that a material aggregate gain or loss from the extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. the $59 million loss associated with the bond repurchase was treated as an extraordinary item. details were as follows (millions of dollars): reacquisition cost of debt $ 1,554 net carrying amount of debt (1,454 ) extraordinary charge pre-tax 100 tax effects (41 ) extraordinary charge $ 59 this extraordinary charge was partially offset in december 1999 with a credit relating to wholesale power activity. in december 2000, there was an additional extraordinary credit relating to wholesale power activity. sales to other electric utilities as part of the corporate realignment on july 1, 2000, ppl electric's contracts for sales to other electric utilities were assigned to ppl energyplus, which was transferred to an unregulated subsidiary of ppl. see note 12 for information on the corporate realignment. income and other taxes for 2001, 2000 and 1999 the corporate federal income tax rate was 35%, and the pennsylvania corporate net income tax rate was 9.99%. the tax effects of significant temporary differences comprising ppl electric's net deferred income tax liability were as follows (millions of dollars): 2001 2000 deferred tax assets deferred investment tax credits $ 12 $ 13 nug contracts &amp; buybacks 8 accrued

equal to the amount allowed in utility rates, was charged to depreciation expense. such amounts were invested in external trust funds which could only be used for future decommissioning costs. in connection with the corporate realignment, effective july 1, 2000, the generating and certain other related assets, along with associated liabilities related to the operation and decommissioning of the susquehanna nuclear station, were transferred to ppl susquehanna. financial instruments the carrying amount on the balance sheet and the estimated fair value of ppl electric's financial instruments are as follows (millions of dollars): december 31, 2001 december 31, 2000 carrying amount fair value carrying amount fair value assets cash and cash equivalents (a) $ 79 $ 79 $ 267 $ 267

carrying value of these financial instruments generally is based on established market prices and approximates fair value. (b) the fair value generally is based on quoted market prices for the securities where available and estimates based on current rates offered to ppl electric where quoted market prices are not available. credit arrangements and financing activities in order to enhance liquidity, and as a credit back-stop to the commercial paper programs, ppl electric, ppl capital funding and ppl (as guarantor for ppl capital funding) shared a 364-day $750 million credit facility and a five-year $300 million credit facility, each with a group of banks. in june 2001, these credit facilities were terminated and ppl electric obtained a new $400 million 364-day revolving-credit facility. no borrowings were outstanding under this facility at december 31, 2001. during december 2001, ppl electric terminated its existing commercial paper program and established a new program. at december 31, 2001, ppl electric had no commercial paper outstanding. in march 2001, ppl electric bought back an option related to its 6-1/8% reset put securities due 2006. the option would have permitted a third party to remarket these securities at higher interest rates in may 2001. ppl electric retired the $200 million, 6-1/8% reset put securities in may 2001. in july 2001, ppl electric retired all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds, 9-3/8% series due 2021, at $5 million aggregate par value through the maintenance and replacement fund provisions of the 1945 first mortgage bond indenture. in august 2001, ppl electric issued $800 million of senior secured bonds as part of a strategic initiative. see note 15 for additional information. ppl electric used a portion of these proceeds to repurchase $280 million of its common stock from ppl. in september 2001, ppl electric repurchased $15 million aggregate par value of its first mortgage bonds, 6-1/2% series due 2005, at a market value that approximated par value. during december 2001, ppl electric repurchased $4 million par value of its first mortgage bonds, 6.55% series due 2006, at a market value that approximated par value. ppl electric also repurchased 148,000 shares of its 6-1/8% series preferred stock, also at a market value that approximated par value. during the year 2001, ppl transition bond company made principal payments on bonds totaling $241 million. stock-based compensation under the ppl incentive compensation plan ("icp") and the incentive compensation plan for key employees ("icpke") (together, the "plans"), restricted shares of common stock as well as stock options may be granted to officers and other key employees of ppl, ppl electric and other affiliated companies. awards under the plans are made in the common stock of ppl by the compensation and corporate governance committee ("ccgc") of the ppl board of directors in the case of the icp, and by the ppl corporate leadership council ("clc") in the case of the icpke. each plan limits the number of shares available for awards to two percent of the outstanding common stock of ppl on the first day of each calendar year. the maximum number of options which can be awarded under each plan to any single eligible employee in any calendar year is 1.5 million shares. any portion of these options that has not been granted may be carried over and used in any subsequent year. if any award lapses or is forfeited or the rights to the participant terminate, any shares of common stock are again available for grant. shares delivered under the plans may be in the form of authorized and unissued common stock, common stock held in treasury by ppl or common stock purchased on the open market (including private purchases) in accordance with applicable securities laws. restricted stock restricted shares of ppl common stock are outstanding shares with full voting and dividend rights. however, the shares are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death. restricted shares vest fully if control of ppl changes, as defined by the plans. restricted stock awards of 19,410; 25,790; and 13,380 shares, with per share weighted-average fair values of $44.79, $20.46 and $26.65, were granted to employees of ppl electric in 2001, 2000 and 1999. compensation expense for these three years was not significant. at december 31, 2001, there were 58,030 restricted shares outstanding. these awards currently vest three years from the date of grant. stock options under the plans, stock options may also be granted with an option exercise price per share not less than the fair market value of ppl's common stock on the date of grant. the options are exercisable beginning one year after the date of grant, assuming the individual is still employed by ppl or a subsidiary (including ppl electric), in installments as determined by the ccgc in the case of the icp, and the clc in the case of the icpke. the clc and ccgc have discretion to accelerate the exercisability of the options. all options expire no later than ten years from the grant date. the options become exercisable if control of ppl changes, as defined by the plans. ppl applies apb opinion no. 25, "accounting for stock issued to employees," and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. since stock options are granted at market price, no compensation cost has been recognized. compensation calculated in accordance with the disclosure requirements of sfas 123, &quot;accounting for stock-based compensation,&quot; was not significant. a summary of stock option activity follows: stock option activity number of options weighted average exercise price balance at december 31, 1998 options granted 47,090 $ 26.84 balance at december 31, 1999 47,090 $ 26.84 options granted 58,310 $ 22.65 balance at december 31, 2000 105,400 $ 24.53 (15,699 options exercisable) options granted 92,450 $ 43.16 options exercised (33,908 ) $ 25.04 balance at december 31, 2001 163,942 $ 34.92 (16,924 options exercisable) the weighted average fair values of options at their grant date during 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $10.42, $3.37 and $2.37. the estimated fair value of each option granted was calculated using a modified black-scholes option-pricing model. the weighted average assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2001 2000 1999 risk-free interest rate 5.46% 6.75% 5.61% expected option term 10 yrs 10 yrs 10 yrs expected stock volatility 30.24% 19.66% 16.19% dividend yield 4.28% 5.70% 6.60% outstanding options had a weighted-average remaining life of 8.5 years at december 31, 2001. retirement and postemployment benefits pension and other postretirement benefits in connection with the corporate realignment on july 1, 2000, sponsorship of the various pension and postretirement benefit plans was transferred from ppl electric to ppl services to provide for participation by any of the newly realigned companies. substantially all employees of ppl electric are covered by a defined benefit plan and will become eligible for certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement through plans sponsored by ppl services. the net periodic pension costs (or credits) allocated to ppl electric were approximately $(30) million in 2001, $(8) million in 2000 and $10 million in 1999. periodic pension cost charged or (credited) to operating expense was approximately $(24) million in 2001, $(6) million in 2000 and $8 million in 1999. the cost or credit in excess of amounts recorded to expense were allocated to construction and other non-expense accounts. at december 31, 2001, the recorded balance of ppl electric's allocated share of the total pension liability was $68 million. in 2001, ppl changed its method of amortizing unrecognized gains or losses in the annual pension expense/income determined under sfas 87. this change resulted in a cumulative-effect credit of $5 million after-tax, which is reflected as a "cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle" on the statement of income. under the old method, unrecognized gains and losses in excess of ten percent of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets were amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated average future service period of plan participants. under the new method, a second corridor will be utilized for unrecognized gains and losses in excess of thirty percent of the plan's projected benefit obligation. unrecognized gains and losses outside the second corridor will be amortized on a straight-line method over a period equal to one half of the average future service period of the plan participants. the new method is preferable under sfas 87 because it provides more current recognition of gains and losses, thereby lessening the accumulation of unrecognized gains and losses. the pro-forma effect of retroactive application of this change in accounting principle would have reduced net income by $5 million in 2001 and would have increased net income by $4 million in 2000, and by $1 million in prior periods. postretirement medical costs recorded by ppl electric were approximately $15 million in 2001, $24 million in 2000 and $25 million in 1999. the decrease in postretirement medical costs is the result of the corporate realignment. this resulted in postretirement medical costs being allocated between the regulated and unregulated businesses. postretirement medical costs charged to operating expense were approximately $11 million in 2001, $19 million in 2000 and $20 million in 1999. costs in excess of amounts charged to expense were charged to construction and other non-expense accounts. at december 31, 2001, the balance in ppl electric's allocated share of the total postretirement medical liability was $3 million. at december 31, 2001, ppl electric had a regulatory asset of $6 million relating to postretirement benefits that is being amortized and recovered in rates, with a remaining life of 11 years. ppl electric also maintains an additional liability for the cost of health care of retired miners of former subsidiaries that had been engaged in coal mining. at december 31, 2001, the liability was $22 million. the liability is the net of $52 million of estimated future benefit payments offset by $30 million of available assets in a ppl electric-funded veba trust. savings plans substantially all employees of ppl electric are eligible to participate in deferred savings plans (401(k)s). contributions to the plans charged to operating expense approximated $2 million in 2001, $4 million in 2000 and $4 million in 1999. substantially all employees of ppl electric are also eligible to participate in ppl's esop. postemployment benefits ppl electric provides health and life insurance benefits to disabled employees and income benefits to eligible spouses of deceased employees. postemployment benefits charged to operating expenses were not significant in 2001, 2000 or 1999. commitments and contingent liabilities ppl electric is involved in numerous legal proceedings, claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. ppl electric cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material liabilities. environmental matters in connection with the corporate realignment, effective july 1, 2000, any air, water and residual waste contingent liabilities associated with the generation assets of ppl electric were assumed by ppl generation. superfund and other remediation in 1995, ppl electric entered into a consent order with the pennsylvania dep to address a number of sites where it may be liable for remediation. this may include potential pcb contamination at certain ppl electric substations and pole sites; potential contamination at a number of coal gas manufacturing facilities formerly owned or operated by ppl electric; and oil or other contamination which may exist at some of ppl electric's former generating facilities. in conjunction with the july 1, 2000 corporate realignment, ppl electric's generating facilities were transferred to subsidiaries of ppl generation. as of december 31, 2001, work has been completed on approximately 80% of the sites included in the consent order. at december 31, 2001, ppl electric had accrued approximately $5 million, representing the estimated amount it will have to spend for site remediation, including those sites covered by its consent order mentioned above. guarantees of affiliated companies at december 31, 2001, ppl electric provided a guarantee in the amount of $7 million in support of safe harbor water power corporation, in which ppl electric had an ownership interest prior to the corporate realignment. ppl holtwood now has this ownership interest. source of labor supply as of december 31, 2001, ppl electric had a total of 3,594 full-time employees with approximately 76%, or 2,735, being members of the ibew local union 1600. the agreement with the ibew local union 1600 was negotiated in 1998 and expires in may 2002. related party transactions as part of the corporate realignment, ppl electric entered into power sales agreements with ppl energyplus for the purchase of electricity to meet its obligations as a plr for customers who have not selected an alternative supplier under the customer choice act. under the terms of these agreements, this electricity was purchased by ppl electric at the applicable shopping credits authorized by the puc, plus nuclear decommissioning costs, less state taxes. these purchases total $1.3 billion in 2001 and $540 million in the last half of 2000, and are included in "energy purchases" on the statement of income. these agreements expired on december 31, 2001. see note 15 for information regarding the new agreement whereby ppl energyplus began providing electricity for ppl electric's plr load obligation on january 1, 2002. also as part of the corporate realignment, ppl electric executed a reciprocal contract with ppl energyplus to sell electricity purchased under contracts with nugs. ppl electric purchases electricity from the nugs at contractual rates and then sells the electricity at the same price to ppl energyplus. these revenues totaled $176 million in 2001 and $85 million in the last half of 2000, and are included in operating revenues as "wholesale energy marketing and trading" on the statement of income. in august 2001, ppl electric made a $90 million payment to ppl energyplus in connection with the generation supply agreements between the companies. see note 15 for additional information. in december 2001, ppl electric made two loans from excess cash to ppl energy funding in the aggregate principal amount of $350 million. in connection with these loans, ppl energy funding issued to ppl electric a demand promissory note in the original principal amount of $150 million requiring interest to be paid monthly at an annual interest rate of 4.0%, and a one-year term promissory note in the original principal amount of $200 million requiring interest to be paid monthly at an annual interest rate of 6.5%. ppl electric has notes receivable from other affiliates of ppl that are due on demand. these notes were issued as a result of ppl's process for efficiently managing its overall cash position whereby ppl electric, from time to time, may loan excess cash to affiliates at market rates. interest earned on loans to affiliated companies and interest incurred on borrowings from affiliated companies are included in "other income - net" and "interest expense," respectively, in the statement of income. intercompany interest income was $5 million and $22 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001 and 2000. intercompany interest expense was $8 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2000 and was not significant in 2001. corporate functions such as financial, legal, human resources and information services were transferred to ppl services in the corporate realignment. ppl services bills the respective ppl subsidiaries for the cost of such services when they can be specifically identified. the cost of these services that are not directly charged to ppl subsidiaries is allocated to certain of the subsidiaries based on the relative capital invested by ppl in these subsidiaries. ppl services charged ppl electric approximately $68 million in 2001 and $22 million in the last half of 2000 for direct expenses. ppl services also allocated ppl electric overhead costs of approximately $28 million in 2001 and $41 million in the last half of 2000. while the allocation of overhead costs decreased in 2001 from 2000, direct expense allocations increased. this was primarily due to an intensified effort to identify more products and services as direct support in 2001, resulting in lower overhead costs. corporate realignment on july 1, 2000, ppl and ppl electric completed a corporate realignment in order to effectively separate ppl electric's regulated transmission and distribution operations from its recently deregulated generation operations and to better position the companies and their affiliates in the new competitive marketplace. the realignment included ppl electric's transfer of certain generation and related assets, and associated liabilities, to ppl and its unregulated subsidiaries at book value. the net book value of this transfer, recorded effective july 1, 2000, was $271 million. this $271 million non-cash dividend to ppl had a significant impact on the consolidated assets and liabilities of ppl electric. as indicated on the statement of cash flows of ppl electric, approximately $73 million of cash and cash equivalents of consolidated affiliates was divested as a result of the realignment distribution. the following major reductions in consolidated assets and liabilities resulted from the non-cash dividend (millions of dollars): assets cash and cash equivalents $ 73 other current assets 331 investments 578 property, plant and equipment 1,969 other noncurrent assets 16 2,967 liabilities and equity current liabilities 767 deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities 1,935 minimum pension liability component of accumulated other comprehensive income (6 ) 2,696 net dividend $ 271 as a result of the corporate realignment, ppl electric's principal businesses are the transmission and distribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central pennsylvania, and the supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a plr. other subsidiaries of ppl and ppl electric are generally aligned in the new corporate structure according to their principal business functions. the corporate realignment followed receipt of various regulatory approvals, including approvals from the puc, the ferc, the nrc and the irs. new accounting standards sfas 141 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 141, "business combinations," which eliminates the pooling-of-interest method of accounting for business combinations and requires the use of the purchase method. in addition, sfas 141 requires the reassessment of intangible assets to determine if they are appropriately classified either separately or within goodwill. sfas 141 is effective for business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001. ppl electric adopted sfas 141 on july 1, 2001, with no material impact on the financial statements. sfas 142 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 142, "goodwill and other intangible assets , " which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite economic useful lives. sfas 142 requires an annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization. ppl electric adopted sfas 142 on january 1, 2002, with no material impact on the financial statements. sfas 143 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 143, "accounting for asset retirement obligations," on the accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. sfas 143 requires a liability to be recognized in the financial statements for retirement obligations meeting specific criteria. measurement of the initial obligation is to approximate fair value, with an equivalent amount recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset. the asset will be depreciated in accordance with normal depreciation policy and the liability will be increased, with a charge to the income statement, until the obligation is settled. sfas 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15, 2002. the potential impact of adopting sfas 143 is not yet determinable, but may be material. sfas 144 in august 2001, the fasb issued sfas 144, "accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets," that replaces sfas 121, "accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of." for long-lived assets to be held and used, sfas 144 retains the requirements of sfas 121 to (a) recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows and (b) measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. for long-lived assets to be disposed of, sfas 144 establishes a single accounting model based on the framework established in sfas 121. the accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long-lived assets, including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no. 30, "reporting the results of operations - reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business, and extraordinary, unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions," for the disposal of segments of a business. sfas 144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations. ppl electric adopted sfas 144 on january 1, 2002, with no material impact on the financial statements. derivative instruments and hedging activities ppl electric adopted sfas 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities," on january 1, 2001. sfas 133 requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. sfas 133 requires that as of the date of adoption, the difference between the fair market value of derivative instruments recorded on the balance sheet and the previous carrying amount of those derivatives be reported in net income or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. at december 31, 2001, ppl electric had no derivative instruments. strategic initiative in august 2001, ppl completed a strategic initiative to confirm the structural separation of ppl electric from ppl and ppl's other affiliated companies. this initiative enabled ppl electric to reduce business risk by securing a supply contract adequate to meet its plr obligations and enabled ppl electric to lower its capital costs. in connection with this initiative, ppl electric: obtained a long-term electric supply contract to meet its plr obligations, at prices generally equal to the pre-determined "capped" rates it is authorized to charge its plr customers from 2002 through 2009 under the 1998 puc settlement order; agreed to limit its businesses to electric transmission and distribution and activities relating to or arising out of those businesses; adopted amendments to its articles of incorporation and bylaws containing corporate governance and operating provisions designed to reinforce its corporate separateness from affiliated companies; appointed an independent director to its board of directors and required the unanimous consent of the board of directors, including the consent of the independent director, to amendments to these corporate governance and operating provisions or to the commencement of any insolvency proceeding, including any filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or other similar actions; appointed an independent compliance administrator to review, on a semi-annual basis, its compliance with the new corporate governance and operating requirements contained in its amended articles of incorporation and bylaws; and adopted a plan of division pursuant to the pennsylvania business corporation law. the plan of division resulted in two separate corporations. ppl electric was the surviving corporation and a new pennsylvania corporation was created. under the plan of division, $5 million of cash and certain of ppl electric's potential liabilities were allocated to the new corporation. ppl has guaranteed the obligations of the new corporation with respect to such liabilities. the enhancements to ppl electric's legal separation from its affiliates are intended to minimize the risk that a court would order ppl electric's assets and liabilities to be substantively consolidated with those of ppl or another affiliate of ppl in the event that ppl or another ppl affiliate were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case. at a special meeting of ppl electric's shareowners held on july 17, 2001, the plan of division and the amendments to ppl electric's articles of incorporation and bylaws were approved, and became effective upon filing the articles of division and the plan of division with the secretary of state of the commonwealth of pennsylvania. this filing was made in august 2001. as part of the strategic initiative, ppl electric solicited bids to contract with energy suppliers to meet its obligation to deliver energy to its customers from 2002 through 2009. in june 2001, ppl electric announced that ppl energyplus was the low bidder, among six bids examined, and was selected to provide the energy supply requirements of ppl electric from 2002 through 2009. under this contract, ppl energyplus will provide electricity at pre-determined capped prices that ppl electric is authorized to charge its plr customers, and received a $90 million payment to offset differences between the revenues expected under the capped prices and projected market prices through the life of the supply agreement (as projected by ppl energyplus at the time of its bid). the contract resulted in ppl energyplus having an eight-year contract at current market prices. ppl has guaranteed the obligations of ppl energyplus under the new contract. in july 2001, the energy supply contract was approved by the puc and accepted for filing by the ferc. also in july 2001, ppl electric filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to issue up to $900 million in debt. in august 2001, ppl electric sold $800 million of senior secured bonds under this registration statement. the offering consisted of two series of bonds: $300 million of 5-7/8% series due 2007 and $500 million of 6-1/4% series due 2009. ppl electric used a portion of the proceeds from these debt issuances to make the $90 million up-front payment to ppl energyplus, and $280 million was used to repurchase a portion of its common stock from ppl. the remainder of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. taken collectively, the steps in the strategic initiative are intended to protect the customers of ppl electric from volatile energy prices and facilitate a significant increase in leverage at ppl electric, while lowering its cost of capital. schedule ii - valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves ppl electric utilities corporation (millions of dollars) column a column b column c column d column e

for ppl montana's membership interests. ppl indirectly owns all of ppl montana's outstanding membership interests. in 1999, ppl indirectly transferred $417 million to ppl montana as a capital contribution. such transaction was exempt from registration under the securities act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to section 4(2) thereof. ppl montana has made no other sales of unregistered

(b) distributions on the membership interests will be paid as determined by ppl montana's board of managers. ppl montana made cash distributions indirectly to ppl of $167 million in 2001 and $50

subsidiaries item 7. review of the financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of ppl montana is abbreviated as ppl montana meets the conditions set forth in general instruction (i)(1)(a) and (b) of form 10-k. such analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments ppl montana actively manages the market risks inherent in its business. ppl montana has adopted a comprehensive risk management policy to manage risk exposures related to energy prices, interest rates and counterparty credit. an rmc comprised of senior officers of ppl oversees the risk management function. nonetheless, adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates may result in losses in earnings, cash flows and/or fair values. the forward-looking information presented below only provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions, due to reliance on model assumptions. as a result, actual future results may differ materially from those presented. these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of reasonably possible losses. commodity price risk ppl montana uses various methodologies to simulate forward price curves in the energy markets to estimate the size and probability of changes in market value resulting from commodity price movements. the methodologies require several key assumptions, including selection of confidence levels, the holding period of the commodity positions and the depth and applicability to future periods of historical commodity price information. ppl montana estimated that a 10% adverse movement in market prices across the markets ppl montana operates in, and across all time periods, would have decreased the value of the non-trading portfolio by approximately $49 million at december 31, 2001, as compared to $43 million at december 31, 2000. a similar adverse movement in market prices would decrease the value of the trading portfolio by an insignificant amount at december 31, 2001, as compared to $300,000 at december 31, 2000. however, the change in the value of the non-trading portfolio would have been offset by an increase in the value of the underlying commodity, the electricity generated. the decline in forward prices from 2000 to 2001 is the primary reason for the differences between 2001 and 2000 sensitivity analyses. in addition to commodity price risk, ppl montana's commodity positions are also subject to operational and event risks including, among others, increases in load demand and forced outages at generating plants. ppl montana's risk management program is designed to manage the risks associated with market fluctuations in the price of electricity. ppl montana's risk management policy and programs include risk identification and risk limits management, with measurement and controls for real time risk monitoring. ppl montana has entered into forward contracts that require physical delivery of electricity and derivative financial instruments consisting mainly of financial swaps where settlement is generally based on the difference between a fixed-price and an index-based price for the underlying commodity. interest rate risk ppl montana may use borrowings to provide funds for its operations. ppl montana may utilize various financial derivative products and risk management techniques to adjust the mix of fixed and floating-rate interest rates in its debt portfolio and thereby reduces its exposure to adverse interest rate movements. ppl montana had $44 million in borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2001. report of independent accountants to the board of managers and member of ppl montana, llc in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under item 14(a)(1) on page 176 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ppl montana, llc and its subsidiaries at december 31, 2001 and 2000 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ending december 31, 2001 and 2000 and the period from inception (december 17, 1999) to december 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 14(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. these financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of ppl montana's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the united states of america, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. as discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, ppl montana changed its method of accounting for derivative and hedging activities pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no. 138, accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities (an amendment of fasb statement 133). pricewaterhousecoopers llp minneapolis, mn february 4, 2002 ppl montana, llc management's report on responsibility for financial statements the management of ppl montana is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the consolidated financial statements and all other sections of this annual report. the financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in preparing the financial statements, management makes informed estimates and judgments of the expected effects of events and transactions based upon currently available facts and circumstances. management believes that the financial statements are free of material misstatements and present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of ppl montana. ppl montana's consolidated financial statements have been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp (pwc), independent certified public accountants. pwc's appointment as auditors was previously ratified by the shareowners of ppl. management has made available to pwc all ppl montana's financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of board of manager's meetings. management believes that all representations made to pwc during its audit were valid and appropriate. ppl montana maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance as to the integrity and reliability of the financial statements, the protection of assets from unauthorized use or disposition and the prevention and detection of fraudulent financial reporting. the concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a system of internal control should not exceed the benefits derived and that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control. fundamental to the control system is the selection and training of qualified personnel, an organizational structure that provides appropriate segregation of duties, the utilization of written policies and procedures and the continual monitoring of the system for compliance. in addition, ppl maintains an internal auditing program to evaluate ppl montana's system of internal control for adequacy, application and compliance. management considers the internal auditors' and pwc's recommendations concerning its system of internal control and has taken actions which are believed to be cost-effective in the circumstances to respond appropriately to these recommendations. management believes that ppl montana's system of internal control is adequate to accomplish the objectives discussed in this report. the board of managers, acting through ppl's audit committee, oversees management's responsibilities in the preparation of the financial statements. in performing this function, the audit committee, which is composed of four independent directors, meets periodically with management, the internal auditors and pwc to review the work of each. pwc and the internal auditors have free access to ppl's audit committee and to the board of managers, without management present, to discuss internal accounting control, auditing and financial reporting matters. management also recognizes its responsibility for fostering a strong ethical climate so that ppl montana's affairs are conducted according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. this responsibility is characterized and reflected in the business policies and guidelines of ppl montana. these policies and guidelines address: the necessity of ensuring open communication within ppl montana; potential conflicts of interest; proper procurement activities; compliance with all applicable laws, including those relating to financial disclosure; and the confidentiality of proprietary information. bradley e. spencer chief operating officer and vice president craig d. bartholomew controller item 8.

limited-liability company, and its direct wholly-owned subsidiaries ppl colstrip i, llc and ppl colstrip ii, llc . the subsidiaries have no assets or operations and bear no relationship to colstrip units 1 and 2. all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. ppl montana holdings, llc is the sole member of ppl montana and is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ppl. nature of operations ppl montana commenced operations december 17, 1999 after the purchase of substantially all the generation assets and certain contracts of the utility division of montana power. ppl montana operates steam generation and hydroelectric facilities throughout montana. ppl montana has been designated as an ewg under the federal power act and sells wholesale power throughout the western u.s. use of estimates/contingencies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. ppl montana records loss contingencies in accordance with sfas 5, "accounting for contingencies." property, plant and equipment following are the classes of property, plant and equipment, with the associated accumulated depreciation at december 31 (millions of dollars): 2001 2000 electric generation plant (including jointly- owned plant) $ 386 $ 383 non-generation property 42 27 land 15 15 construction work in progress 14 13 457 438 less: accumulated depreciation 17 10 $ 440 $ 428 property, plant and equipment is recorded at original cost, unless impaired under the provisions of sfas 121, "accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of." original cost includes material, labor, contractor costs, construction overheads and capitalized interest. the cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. maintenance and repair costs include costs associated with major planned overhauls that do not improve or replace an existing asset or extend its useful life. when a component of property, plant or equipment is retired that was depreciated under the composite or group method, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. when all or a significant portion of an operating unit is retired or sold that was depreciated under the composite or group method, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income. depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods. the annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: electric generation in plans service, 5-50 years and non-generation property, 5-40 years. ppl montana periodically reviews and adjusts the depreciable lives of its fixed assets. allowance for doubtful accounts ppl montana maintains its allowance for doubtful accounts based on management's evaluation of the ultimate collectibility of all receivables. in 2001, ppl montana recorded a receivable related to the termination of forward contracts with enron. the receivable has been fully reserved. inventories inventories consist mainly of fuel and materials and supplies. inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost is determined under the average cost method and includes the purchase price and transportation costs of the coal. accounting for price risk management ppl montana enters into commodity contracts for the physical purchase and sale of energy as well as energy contracts that can be settled financially. as of january 1, 2001, contracts that meet the definition of a derivative were accounted for under sfas 133, "accounting for derivative instrument and hedging activities." certain energy contracts have been excluded from sfas 133's requirements because they meet the definition of a "normal sale or purchase" under dig issue c15, "scope exceptions: normal purchases and normal sales exception for certain option-type contracts and forward contracts in electricity." these contracts are reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting. see note 12 for additional information on sfas 133. under sfas 133, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. on the date the derivative contract is executed, ppl montana designates the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ("fair value" hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ("cash flow" hedge), or a non-hedge derivative. changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as, and is designated and qualifies as, a fair value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current-period earnings. changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as, and is designated as and qualifies as, a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows being hedged. changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current- period earnings. in addition, ppl montana may enter into non-derivative contracts that meet the definition of energy trading activities as defined by eitf 98-10, "accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities." in accordance with eitf 98-10, energy trading contract gains and losses from changes in market prices are marked to market through earnings. for 1999 and 2000, ppl montana used eitf 98-10 to account for its commodity forward and financial contracts. as such, contracts that did not meet the definition of energy trading contracts, as defined by eitf 98-10, were reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting. gains and losses from changes in market prices of energy sales contracts are accounted for in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues, and gains and losses from changes in market prices of energy purchase contracts are accounted for in "energy purchases" on the statement of income. the amortized gains and losses from interest rate derivative contracts would be accounted for in "interest expense." financial instruments at december 31, 2001, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, price risk management assets and liabilities, and the revolving line of the credit approximated fair value due to either the short-term nature of the instruments or variable interest rates associated with the financial instruments. at december 31, 2000, except for price risk management liabilities, the carrying amount on the balance sheet approximated the estimated fair value of the financial instruments. the carrying value of the price risk management liabilities was $0 and the fair value was $257 million at december 31, 2000, due to the fact that these contracts were classified as non-trading under eitf 98-10 and were not required to be marked to fair value on the balance sheet in 2000. revenue recognition "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues on the statement of income are recorded based on the amount of electricity delivered to wholesale customers through the last day of each reporting period. income taxes ppl montana is a limited liability company and has elected to be disregarded as a separate entity for federal and state income tax purposes. ppl montana's taxable income or loss is included in the consolidated federal and state income tax returns of ppl. the member is a party to a tax sharing policy that provides that the member is responsible for taxes associated with ppl montana's operations. the income tax provision for ppl montana is calculated in accordance with sfas 109, "accounting for income taxes." income taxes are presented in the accompanying financial statements as if ppl montana files separate returns. the current tax benefit or provision recognized for each period is reported in "accounts receivable from" or "accounts payable to" member, on the balance sheet as applicable. leases see note 5 for a discussion on accounting for leases. cash equivalents all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. comprehensive income comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, defined as changes in member's equity from transactions other than with the member. other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains or losses on qualifying derivatives and the excess of additional pension liability over unamortized prior service costs. comprehensive income is reflected on the statement of member's equity and other comprehensive income. the "accumulated other comprehensive income" of ppl montana at december 31, 2001 was $32 million. reclassifications certain amounts in the 2000 and 1999 financial statement have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. extraordinary item during 2000, ppl montana repaid certain financing debt and reduced the commitments under the revolving credit facility. in accordance with sfas 4, "reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt," an extraordinary loss of approximately $1 million (net of $700,000 of income tax benefit) was recorded to write-off deferred loan fees. income and other taxes for 2001, 2000 and 1999, the corporate federal income tax rate was 35% and the montana corporate income tax rate was 6.75%. the tax effects of significant temporary differences comprising ppl montana's net deferred income tax asset were as follows (millions of dollars): 2001 2000 deferred tax assets accrued retirement costs $ 5 $ 3 wholesale energy commitments 30 39 allowance for doubtful accounts 19 7 other 2

arrangements and financing activities ppl montana has a $100 million working capital credit facility which matures in november 2002. the maturity date may be extended with the consent of the lenders. this facility provides that up to $75 million of the commitment may be used to cause lenders to issue letters of credit. in the event that ppl montana were to draw upon this facility and cause lenders to issue letters of credit on its behalf, ppl montana would be required to reimburse the issuing lenders. at december 31, 2001, $44 million of loans were outstanding under this facility and $25 million of letters of credit were issued. the working capital facility provides that the interest rate, at the option of ppl montana, may be based on either the libor plus an applicable rate, or the adjusted base rate as defined in the agreement. the interest rate, as defined above, is separately fixed for the term of each advance. the weighted average interest rate on the working capital facility was 4.40% for the year ended december 31, 2001. in april 2001, ppl montana executed a new credit facility to allow for incremental letter of credit capacity of $150 million. there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31, 2001. ppl has executed a commitment to the lenders under ppl montana's $150 million credit facility that ppl will provide (or cause ppl energy supply to provide) letters of credit at such times and in such amounts as are necessary to permit ppl montana to remain in compliance with its fixed-price forward energy contracts or its derivative financial instruments entered into to manage energy price risks, to the extent that ppl montana cannot provide such letters of credit under its existing credit agreements. no such letters of credit had been issued as of december 31, 2001. the credit facilities restrict the sale of assets and require that ppl montana maintain certain financial ratios, related to, among other things, cash flow, additional indebtedness and net worth and restrict the sale of assets. ppl montana was in compliance with these requirements as of december 31, 2001 and 2000 and for the years then ended. leases ppl montana applies the provisions of sfas 13, "accounting for leases," to all leasing transactions. in addition, ppl montana applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for leases. in july 2000, ppl montana sold its interest in the colstrip electric plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to ppl montana under four thirty-six year operating leases. the proceeds from this sale approximated $410 million. ppl montana recorded a deferred gain on sale of approximately $8 million, which is being amortized into "other operation and maintenance" in the statement of income over the term of the operating lease on a straight-line basis. ppl montana used the sale proceeds to reduce outstanding debt and make distributions to its parent, ppl generation. ppl montana leases a 50% interest in colstrip units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in unit 3, through four non-cancelable operating leases. the leases provide two renewal options based on the economic useful life of the generation assets. ppl montana is required to pay all expenses associated with the operations of the generation units. the leases place certain restrictions on ppl montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell assets and declare dividends and requires ppl montana to maintain certain financial ratios related to cash flow and net worth. rent expense charged to operations and maintenance expense has been recognized on a straight-line basis and was $21 million and $9 million for the years ended december 31, 2001 and 2000. ppl montana leases a portion of a building under a non-cancelable operating lease, which expires in 2002. ppl montana also leases operating equipment under various short-term leases. the future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows (millions of dollars): year ended december 31, 2002 $ 49 2003 47 2004 44 2005 38 2006 38 thereafter 493 $ 709 stock-based compensation certain officers and employees of ppl montana participate in the incentive compensation plan ("icp") and incentive compensation plan for key employees ("icpke") (together, the "plans") of ppl. under the plans, restricted shares of common stock as well as stock options may be granted to officers and other key employees. awards under the plans are made in the common stock of ppl by the compensation and corporate governance committee ("ccgc") of the ppl board of directors in the case of the icp, and by the ppl corporate leadership council ("clc") in the case of the icpke. each plan limits the number of shares available for awards to two percent of the common outstanding stock of ppl on the first day of each calendar year. the maximum number of options which can be awarded under each plan to any single employee in any calendar year is 1.5 million shares. any portion of these shares that has not been granted may be carried over and used in any subsequent year. if any award lapses or is forfeited or the rights to the participant terminate, any shares of common stock are again available for grant. shares delivered under the plans may be in the form of authorized and unissued common stock, common stock held in treasury by ppl or common stock purchased on the open market (including private purchases) in accordance with applicable securities laws. restricted stock restricted shares of ppl's common stock are outstanding shares with full voting and dividend rights. however, the shares are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death. restricted shares vest fully if control of ppl changes, as defined by the plans. restricted stock awards of 1,630 and 25,308 shares, with per share weighted-average fair values of $45.09 and $24.45, were granted in 2001 and 2000. no awards were made at december 31, 1999. compensation expense for 2001 and 2000 was not significant. at december 31, 2001, there were 2,580 restricted shares outstanding. these awards currently vest three years from the date of grant. stock options under the plans, stock options may also be granted with an option exercise price per share not less than the fair market value of ppl's common stock on the date of grant. the options are exercisable beginning one year after the date of grant, assuming the individual is still employed by ppl or a subsidiary, in installments as determined by the ccgc in the case of the icp, and the clc in the case of the icpke. the clc and ccgc have discretion to accelerate the exercisability of the options. all options expire no later than ten years from the grant date. the options become exercisable if control of ppl changes, as defined in the plan. ppl montana applies apb opinion no. 25, "accounting for stock issued to employees," and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. since stock options are granted at the then current market price, no compensation cost has been recognized. compensation calculated in accordance with the disclosure requirements of sfas 123, "accounting for stock-based compensation," was not significant. a summary of the stock option activity follows: 2001 2000 shares weighted average exercise price shares weighted average exercise price outstanding at beginning of year 100,420 $ 21.79 30,240 $ 26.85 granted 5,860 $ 43.16 73,180 $ 19.91 exercised (3,000 ) $ 26.85 forfeited (16,390 ) $ 19.91 transferred* (68,170 ) $ 22.68 outstanding dec. 31 21,720 $ 26.18 100,420 $ 21.79 *represents employees transferred to other ppl affiliates. the weighted-average fair values of options at their grant date during 2001 and 2000 were $10.42 and $3.35. the estimated fair value of each option granted was calculated using a modified black-scholes option pricing model. the weighted average assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2001 2000 risk free interest rate 5.46% 6.74 % expected option term 10 years 10 years expected stock volatility 30.24% 19.79 % dividend yield 4.28% 5.70 % outstanding options had a weighted-average remaining life of 7.3 years at december 31, 2001. retirement and postemployment benefits pension and other postretirement benefits ppl montana follows the guidance of sfas 87, "employers' accounting for pensions" and sfas 106, "employers' accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions" for these benefits. ppl montana has a funded, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. funding is based upon actuarially determined computations that consider the amount deductible for income tax purposes and the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of 1974. ppl montana also provides supplemental retirement benefits to officers through unfunded nonqualified retirement plans. substantially all employees will become eligible for certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement. in conjunction with the purchase of generation assets from montana power, ppl montana recorded a liability for assumed pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations. no net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, actuarial gains, return on plan assets or contributions were recorded for the period from inception to december 31, 1999. net pension and postretirement benefit costs were (millions of dollars): pension benefits postretirement medical benefits 2001 2000 2001 2000 service cost $ 2 $ 2 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 interest cost 3 2 0.3 0.2 expected return on plan assets (2 ) (2 ) net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost $ 3 $ 2 $ 0.5 $ 0.4 the net periodic pension cost charged to operating expenses was $3 million in 2001 and $700,000 in 2000. retiree health and benefit cost charged to operating expenses was $400,000 in 2001 and $300,000 in 2000. postretirement medical costs at december 31, 2001 were based on the assumption that costs would decrease gradually from 7% in 2001 to 6% in 2006 and thereafter. a one percent increase in the assumed health care cost trend assumption would increase the service cost and interest cost by $27,000 and increase the postretirement benefit obligation by $234,000. a one percent decrease in the assumed health care cost trend assumption would decrease the service cost and interest cost by $24,000 and decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by $203,000. the following assumptions were used in the valuation of the benefit obligations: pension benefits 2001 2000 1999 discount rate 7.25% 7.5% 7.0% expected return on plan assets 9.2% 9.2% 8.0% rate of compensation increase 4.25% 4.75% 5.0% postretirement medical benefits 2001 2000 1999 discount rate 7.25% 7.5% 7.0% rate of compensation increase 4.25%

obligation and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $41 million, $37 million, and $260,000 at december 31, 2001 and $1 million, $200,000 and $0, at december 31, 2000. savings plan substantially all employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan. ppl montana contributed approximately $1 million to the 401(k) plan in both 2001 and 2000. the 1999 contribution was not significant. jointly-owned facilities ppl montana is the operator of the jointly-owned coal-fired generating units comprising the colstrip steam generation facility. at december 31, 2001 and 2000, ppl montana has a 50% leasehold interest in colstrip units 1 and 2 and a 30% leasehold interest in colstrip unit 3 under an operating lease (see note 5 for additional information). ppl montana's share of direct expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of these facilities is included in the corresponding operating expenses in the statements of income. each joint-owner in these facilities provides its own financing. as operator of all colstrip units, ppl montana invoices each joint-owner for their respective portion of the direct expenses. the amount due from joint-owners was approximately $6 million and $7 million at december 31, 2001 and 2000. at december 31, 2001, montana power continues to own a 30% leasehold interest in colstrip unit 4. as part of the purchase of generation assets from montana power, ppl montana and montana power entered into a reciprocal sharing agreement to govern each party's responsibilities regarding the operation of colstrip units 3 and 4, and is responsible for 15% of the respective operating and construction costs, regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to colstrip unit 3 or 4. however, each party is responsible for its own fuel-related costs. commitments and contingent liabilities ppl montana is involved in numerous legal proceedings, claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. ppl montana cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material liabilities. wholesale energy commitments as part of the purchase of generation assets from montana power, ppl montana agreed to supply electricity under two wholesale transition service agreements. in addition, ppl montana assumed a power purchase agreement and another power sales agreement. in accordance with purchase accounting guidelines, ppl montana recorded a liability of $118 million as the estimated fair value of the agreements at the acquisition date. this liability is being amortized over the agreement terms as an adjustment to "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues and "energy purchases," on the statement of income. the unamortized balance at december 31, 2001 was $78 million. ppl montana had two transition agreements to supply wholesale electricity to montana power to serve its retail load not served by other providers or provided by montana power's remaining generation. one agreement provided for the sale of 200 mw from ppl montana's leasehold interest in colstrip unit 3 until it expired in december 2001. the second agreement requires ppl montana to supply montana power's actual remaining customer load. this second agreement will expire on the earlier of june 30, 2002 or when montana power's remaining customer load is zero. in october 2001, ppl announced that ppl energyplus reached an agreement to supply montana power with an aggregate of 450 mw of energy to be supplied by ppl montana. the delivery term of this new contract would be for five years beginning july 1, 2002, which is the day after the termination date of the last of the two existing transition agreements. under the agreement, ppl energyplus will supply 300 mw of around-the-clock electricity and 150 mw of on-peak electricity. in december 2001, the agreement was accepted for filing by the ferc. no further regulatory approvals are required under this agreement. environmental matters air the clean air act deals, in part, with acid rain, attainment of federal ambient ozone standards and toxic air emissions. ppl montana is substantially compliant with the clean air act. the bush administration and certain members of congress have made proposals regarding possible amendments to the clean air act. these amendments could require significant further reductions in no x , so 2 , and mercury and could possibly require measures to limit co 2 . the epa has also developed new standards for ambient levels of ozone and fine particulates in the u.s. these standards were challenged and remanded to the epa by the d.c. circuit court of appeals in 1999. however, on appeal to the united states supreme court, the d. c. circuit court's decision was reversed in part and remanded to the d. c. circuit court. the new particulates standard, if finalized, may require further reductions in so 2 for certain ppl energy supply subsidiaries and year-round no x reductions commencing in 2010-2012 at sip-call levels in pennsylvania, and at slightly less stringent levels in montana. the revised ozone standard, if finalized, is not expected to have a material effect on facilities of ppl montana. under the clean air act, the epa has been studying the health effects of hazardous air emissions from power plants and other sources, in order to determine what emissions should be regulated and has determined that mercury emissions must be regulated. in this regard, the epa is expected to develop regulations by 2004. in 1999, the epa initiated enforcement actions against several utilities, asserting that older, coal-fired power plants operated by those utilities have, over the years, been modified in ways that subject them to more stringent "new source" requirements under the clean air act. the epa has since issued notices of violation and commenced enforcement activities against other utilities. although the epa has threatened to continue expanding its enforcement actions, the future direction of the &quot;new source&quot; requirements is presently unclear. the epa's regional offices that regulate ppl montana's generation plants have indicated an intention to issue information requests to all utilities in its jurisdiction and have issued such a request to ppl montana related to the j.e. corette steam electric station. ppl montana has responded to the information request. ppl montana cannot presently predict what, if any, action the epa might take following ppl montana's responses to such information requests. should the epa or any state initiate one or more enforcement actions against ppl montana, compliance with any such enforcement actions could result in additional capital and operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but which could be significant. the epa is also proposing to revise its regulations in a way that will require power plants to meet "new source" performance standards and/or undergo "new source" review for many maintenance and repair activities that are currently exempt. water/waste the epa has significantly lowered the water quality standard for arsenic. the lowered standard may require ppl montana to further treat wastewater and/or take abatement action at its power plants, the cost of which is not now determinable but could be significant. the epa recently finalized requirements for new or modified water intake structures. these requirements will affect where generating facilities are built, will establish intake design standards, and could lead to requirements for cooling towers at new and modified power plants. another new rule, expected to be finalized in 2003, will address existing structures. each of these rules could impose costs on ppl montana which are not now determinable but which could be significant. remediation in conjunction with its divestiture, montana power prepared a phase i and phase ii environmental site assessment. the assessment identifies approximately $7 million of future capital expenditures through the year 2020 related to various groundwater remediation issues. additional capital expenditures could be required in amounts which are not now determinable, but which could be material. under the montana asset purchase agreement, ppl montana is indemnified by montana power for any preacquisition environmental liabilities. however, this indemnification is conditioned on certain circumstances that could result in ppl montana and montana power sharing in certain costs within limits set forth in the agreement. future cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at sites not currently identified, may result in material additional operating costs for ppl montana that cannot be estimated at this time. general in october 1999, the montana supreme court held in favor of several citizens' groups that the right to a clean and healthful environment is a fundamental right guaranteed by the montana constitution. the court's ruling could result in significantly more stringent environmental laws and regulation as well as an increase in citizens' suits under montana's environmental laws. the effect on ppl montana of any such changes in laws or regulations or any such increase in citizen suits is not currently determinable but could be significant. due to the environmental issues discussed above or other environmental matters, ppl montana may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain plants to comply with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies or courts. in this regard, ppl montana also may incur capital expenditures, operating expenses and other costs in amounts which are not now determinable but which could be significant. credit support ppl guaranteed certain obligations under power purchases and sales agreements of ppl montana for up to $138 million. as of december 31, 2001, there were no guarantees outstanding under the power purchase and sales agreements. source of labor supply as of december 31, 2001, ppl montana had 485 full-time employees. approximately 65% of the ppl montana employees are represented by ibew locals, and 2% are represented by the teamsters. in 2001, ppl montana reached a new three-year contract with the employees represented by ibew local 1638 and reached a new four-year contract with ibew local 44. ppl montana is currently negotiating with the teamsters for a new employment agreement. mpsc order in june 2001, the mpsc issued an order (mpsc order) in which it found that montana power must continue to provide electric service to its customers at tariffed rates until its transition plan under the montana electricity utility industry restructuring and customer choice act is finally approved, and that purchasers of generating assets from montana power must provide electricity to meet montana power's full load requirements at prices to montana power that reflect costs calculated as if the generation assets had not been sold. ppl montana purchased montana power's interests in two coal-fired plants and eleven hydroelectric units in 1999. in july 2001, ppl montana filed a complaint against the mpsc with the u.s. district court in helena, montana, challenging the mpsc order. in its complaint, ppl montana asserted, among other things, that the federal power act preempts states from exercising regulatory authority over the sale of electricity in wholesale markets, and requested the court to declare the mpsc action preempted, unconstitutional and void. in addition, the complaint requested that the mpsc be enjoined from seeking to exercise any authority, control or regulation of wholesale sales from ppl montana's generating assets. at this time, ppl montana cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings related to the mpsc order, what actions the mpsc, the montana legislature or any other governmental authority may take on these or related matters, or the ultimate impact on ppl montana of any of these matters. montana power shareholders' litigation in august 2001, a purported class-action lawsuit was filed by a group of shareholders of montana power against montana power, the directors of montana power, certain unnamed advisors and consultants of montana power, and ppl montana. the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that montana power was required to, and did not, obtain shareholder approval of the sale of montana power's generation assets to ppl montana in 1999. although most of the claims in the complaint are against montana power, its board of directors, and its consultants and advisors, two claims are asserted against ppl montana. in the first claim, plaintiffs seek a declaration that because montana power shareholders did not vote on the 1999 sale of generating assets to ppl montana, that sale "was null and void ab initio." the second claim alleges that ppl montana was privy to, and participated in, a strategy whereby montana power would sell its generation assets to ppl montana without first obtaining montana power shareholder approval, and that ppl montana has made net profits in excess of $100 million as the result of this alleged illegal sale. in the second claim, plaintiffs request that the court impose a "resulting and/or constructive trust" on both the generation assets themselves and all profits, plus interest on the amounts subject to the trust. ppl montana is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. employee litigation in april 2000, three employees at ppl montana's colstrip facility were severely burned when an equipment fault in colstrip unit 1 caused electrical arcing. in may 2000, the injured employees and their spouses filed litigation for their injuries in montana district court against montana power. ppl montana was subsequently named as a party defendant to the pending litigation and a mediation conference has been scheduled for may 2002. a trial has been scheduled for june 2002. at this time, ppl montana cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings. energy supply to energy west resources, inc. in july 2001, ppl montana filed an action in state court and a responsive pleading in federal court, both related to a breach of contract by energy west resources, inc. (energy west), a great falls, montana-based energy aggregator. ppl montana is seeking a judgment that energy west violated the terms of the contract under which it supplies energy to energy west and should pay damages of at least $7.5 million. all litigation in this matter has been consolidated in the u. s. district court for the district of montana, great falls division, and is proceeding in that forum. ppl montana cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings. related party transactions ppl has interests in other entities with which ppl montana has transactions. although transactions with these entities cannot be presumed to be at arms length, it is the intention of the parties and ppl montana that these transactions be conducted at terms comparable to those available with third parties. ppl montana has executed a brokering and contract management agreement with ppl energyplus. the agreement authorizes ppl energyplus to act as exclusive agent in managing ppl montana's wholesale energy supply and energy and capacity purchase contracts. the agreement also grants ppl energyplus express authority and responsibility for managing the sale of energy in excess of wholesale contract commitments. ppl montana retains title to all energy that is sold into the wholesale market. ppl montana must pay ppl energyplus a fee to cover its annual operating expenses related to its responsibilities under the brokering and contract management agreement. the total amount paid to ppl energyplus was $5 million for both years ended december 31, 2001 and 2000 and is included in "other operations and maintenance" on the statement of income. the amounts due to ppl energyplus at december 31, 2001 and 2000 were $500,000 and $400,000, and are included in "accounts receivable from affiliated companies" on the balance sheet. ppl montana has a memorandum of understanding ("mou") with ppl energyplus regarding the supply of energy to satisfy ppl energyplus' obligations under its retail contracts. the mou was effective through december 31, 2001. ppl montana has renewed the mou with substantially the same terms. the mou provides that ppl montana will provide the energy necessary for ppl energyplus to supply energy services to its customers, taking into account ppl montana's energy commitments to third parties under wholesale supply agreements. ppl energyplus will take title to the energy and has the sole authority to sell the energy and assumes all customer credit risks. the mou provides for two different pricing mechanisms, dependent upon the underlying ppl energyplus retail contract structure. if ppl energyplus sells power at a fixed price during the contract term, ppl montana will supply energy to ppl energyplus for the term of the contact at the mid-columbia forward price agreed upon by ppl montana and ppl energyplus at the date the contract is executed. if ppl energyplus enters into a floating price agreement, ppl montana will supply energy to ppl energyplus for the term of the contract at a floating price. the floating price ppl energyplus will pay will be the mid-columbia forward price plus $1.00 per mwh. if ppl energyplus enters into a retail contract to sell energy at a price that is structured with both fixed and floating components, the pricing will use a combination of the above mechanisms. total energy sales to ppl energyplus were $80 million and $33 million for the years ended december 31, 2001 and 2000 and are included in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues on the statement of income. the amount due from ppl energyplus was $4 million and $13 million at december 31, 2001 and 2000, and is included on the balance sheet. there were no sales to ppl energyplus under the mou for the period from inception to december 31, 1999. ppl has guaranteed certain obligations of ppl montana for up to $20 million under power purchase and sales agreements at december 31, 2000. there were no guarantees at december 31, 2001. corporate functions such as financial, legal, human resources and information services were transferred to ppl services in the corporate realignment. ppl services bills the respective ppl subsidiaries for the cost of such services when they can be specifically identified. the cost of these services that are not directly charged to ppl subsidiaries is allocated to certain of the subsidiaries based on the relative capital invested by ppl in these subsidiaries. ppl services charged ppl montana approximately $7 million for direct expenses and $3 million for overhead costs in 2001. similar charges totaled approximately $4 million in 2000. new accounting standards sfas 141 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 141, "business combinations," which eliminates the pooling-of-interest method of accounting for business combinations and requires the use of the purchase method. in addition, sfas 141 requires the reassessment of intangible assets to determine if they are appropriately classified either separately or within goodwill. sfas 141 is effective for business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001. ppl montana adopted sfas 141 on july 1, 2001, with no material impact on the financial statements. sfas 142 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 142, "goodwill and other intangible assets," which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite economic useful lives. sfas 142 requires an annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization. ppl montana adopted sfas 142 on january 1, 2002, with no material impact on the financial statements. sfas 143 in june 2001, the fasb issued sfas 143, "accounting for asset retirement obligations," on the accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. sfas 143 requires a liability to be recognized in the financial statements for retirement obligations meeting specific criteria. measurement of the initial obligation is to approximate fair value, with an equivalent amount recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset. the asset will be depreciated in accordance with normal depreciation policy and the liability will be increased, with a charge to the income statement, until the obligation is settled. sfas 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15, 2002. the potential impact of adopting sfas 143 is not yet determinable, but may be material. sfas 144 in august 2001, the fasb issued sfas 144, "accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets," that replaces sfas 121, "accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of." for long-lived assets to be held and used, sfas 144 retains the requirements of sfas 121 to (a) recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows and (b) measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. for long-lived assets to be disposed of, sfas 144 establishes a single accounting model based on the framework established in sfas 121. the accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long-lived assets, including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no. 30, "reporting the results of operations - reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business, and extraordinary, unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions," for the disposal of segments of a business. sfas 144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations. ppl montana adopted sfas 144 on january 1, 2002, with no material impact on the financial statements. derivative instruments and hedging activities ppl montana adopted sfas 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities," on january 1, 2001. upon adoption and in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas 133, ppl montana had no recorded cumulative-effect adjustment in earnings. ppl montana recorded a cumulative-effect charge of $156 million in "accumulated other comprehensive income," a component of member's equity. as of december 31, 2001, the balance in member's equity related to unrealized gains and losses on qualifying derivatives was a net gain of $33 million, as a result of the reclassifying part of the transition adjustment into earnings and changes in market prices. management of market risk exposures ppl montana's primary market risk exposures are associated with commodity prices. ppl montana actively manages the market risk inherent in its commodity positions. the board of managers of ppl montana has adopted a risk management policy to manage the risk exposures related to energy prices. this policy monitors and assists in controlling market risk and use of derivative instruments to manage some associated commodity activities. ppl montana's derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of rmc. the rmc is composed of the chief financial officer and other officers of ppl. the rmc reports to the finance committee of the ppl board of directors on the scope of its derivative activities. the rmc sets forth risk-management philosophy and objectives through a corporate policy, provides guidelines for derivative-instrument usage, and establishes procedures for control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of derivative activity. ppl montana utilizes financial and physical contracts as part of its risk management strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price volatility. all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, unless they meet sfas 133's criteria for exclusion. fair value hedges ppl montana enters into financial contracts to hedge a portion of the fair value of firm commitments of forward electricity sales. these contracts range in maturity through 2003. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001, ppl montana did not recognize any gains or losses resulting from the ineffective portion of fair value hedges or from firm commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedge items. cash flow hedges ppl montana enters into financial swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with electric commodities. these contracts range in maturity through 2006. as a result of changes in economic conditions, ppl montana discontinued hedge accounting for certain cash flow hedges which resulted in a net gain of $7 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001 (reported in "wholesale energy marketing and trading" revenues on the statement of income). the impact on the financial statements resulting from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness for the twelve months ended december 31, 2001 was immaterial. as of december 31, 2001, the net unrealized gain on derivative instruments in "accumulated other comprehensive income" expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months was $11 million. unrealized gains/losses on

gain on qualifying derivatives 33 cumulative unrealized gain on qualifying derivatives, end of period $ 33 credit concentration ppl montana enters into contracts with many entities for the purchase and sale of energy. most of these contracts are considered a normal part of doing business and as such the mark-to-market value of these contracts is not reflected in the financial statements. however, the mark-to-market value of these contracts is considered when committing to new business from a credit perspective. at year-end, ppl montana had a credit exposure of $271 million to energy trading partners. the majority of this amount was the mark-to-market value of multi-year contracts for energy sales. therefore, if the counterparties fail to perform their obligations, ppl montana would not experience an immediate financial loss, but would experience lower revenues in future years to the extent that replacement sales could not be made at the same prices as the defaulted contracts. of the $271 million, three counterparties account for 95% of the exposure. no other individual counterparty accounted for more than 2% of the exposure. each of the three primary counterparties has at least a bbb+ credit rating. ppl montana has the right to request collateral from each of these counterparties in the event their credit rating falls below investment grade. it is also ppl montana's policy to enter into netting agreements with each of its counterparties to minimize credit exposure. sales to california independent system operator and to other pacific northwest purchasers ppl montana has made approximately $18 million of sales to the california iso for which ppl montana has not yet been paid in full. given the myriad of electricity supply problems presently faced by the california electric utilities and the california iso, ppl montana cannot predict whether or when it will receive payment. as of december 31, 2001, ppl montana has fully reserved for possible underrecoveries of payments for these sales. litigation arising out of the california electricity supply situation has been filed at the ferc and in california courts against sellers of energy to the california iso. the plaintiffs and intervenors in these proceedings allege abuses of market power, manipulation of market prices, unfair trade practices and violations of state antitrust laws, and seek price caps on wholesale sales in california and other western power markets, refunds of excess profits allegedly earned on these sales of energy, and other relief, including treble damages and attorneys fees. ppl montana has intervened in the ferc proceedings in order to protect its interests, but has not been named as a defendant in any of the court actions alleging abuses of market power, manipulation of market prices, unfair trade practices and violations of state antitrust laws among other things. ppl montana has been named as a defendant in a declaratory judgment action initiated by the state of california to prevent certain members of the california power exchange from seeking compensation for the state's seizure of certain energy contracts. ppl montana is a member of the california power exchange, but it has no energy contracts with or through the california power exchange and has not sought compensation in connection with the state's seizure. attorneys general in several western states, including california, have begun investigations related to the electricity supply situation in california and other western states. the ferc has determined that all sellers of energy in the california markets, including ppl montana, should be subject to refund liability for the period beginning october 2, 2000 through june 20, 2001 and has initiated an evidentiary hearing concerning refund amounts. the ferc also is considering whether to order refunds for sales made in the pacific northwest, including sales made by ppl montana. the ferc administrative law judge assigned to this proceeding has recommended that no refunds be ordered for sales into the pacific northwest. the ferc presently is considering this recommendation. ppl montana cannot predict whether or the extent to which it will be the target of any governmental investigation or named in these lawsuits, refund proceedings or other lawsuits, the outcome of any such proceedings or whether the ultimate impact on ppl montana of the electricity supply situation in california and other western states will be material. regulatory issues ppl montana has eleven hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir licensed by the ferc pursuant to the federal power act under long-term licenses which expire on varying dates from 2009 through 2040. pursuant to section 8(e) of the federal power act, the ferc approved the transfer from montana power of all pertinent licenses and any amendments thereto, for the ownership and operation of these facilities purchased by ppl montana. the kerr dam project license was jointly issued by the ferc to montana power and the confederated salish and kootenai tribes of the flathead reservation in 1985, and required montana power to hold and operate the project for 30 years. the license required montana power, and subsequently ppl montana as a result of the purchase of the kerr dam from montana power, to continue to implement a plan to mitigate the impact of the kerr dam on fish, wildlife and habitat. the implementation will require payments totaling approximately $6 million between 2002 to 2020. additionally, ppl montana is required to make annual payments to the confederated salish and kootenai tribes for the use of the property the kerr dam occupies. ppl montana expensed approximately $15 million and $14 million for the years ended december 31, 2001 and 2000 and $534,000 for the period from inception through december 31, 1999. ppl montana is subject to the jurisdiction of certain federal, regional, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. the operations of its generating facilities are subject to the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and comparable state statutes. in addition, ppl montana is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation by its coal plants of certain level and density monitoring devices. management believes at this time that it is operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of the various agencies and there are no current actions which will have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. pending transactions ppl global, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ppl and an affiliate of ppl montana, was party to separate asset purchase agreements (each an "apa") with portland general electric company ("pge") and puget sound energy, inc. ("pse") to purchase their respective interests in the colstrip units and certain related transmission assets and rights. the interested parties mutually agreed to terminate the apa's. the montana power apa, previously assigned to ppl montana by ppl global, provided if neither the pse or pge acquisitions are consummated, ppl montana is required to purchase a portion of montana power's interest in the 500-kilovolt colstrip transmission system ("cts") for $97 million, for which regulatory approval has been received. ppl montana is currently in discussions with montana power to pursue alternatives to acquiring this entire interest in the cts as contemplated by the apa. these discussions are ongoing; therefore, ppl montana cannot predict whether it will buy all or less than all of montana power's entire interest in the cts, or what the purchase price will be if a purchase occurs. proposed montana hydroelectric initiative in january 2002, the montana secretary of state certified, in accordance with applicable statutes, that it had approved the form of a proposed montana "hydroelectric security act" initiative. the proposed initiative may be placed on the november 2002 statewide ballot if sufficient signatures are obtained prior to june 21, 2002. among the stated purposes of the proposed initiative is to create an elected montana public power commission to determine whether purchasing hydroelectric dams in montana is in the public interest. such commission could decide whether to acquire ppl montana's hydroelectric dams either pursuant to a negotiated purchase or an acquisition at fair market value through the power of condemnation. at this time, ppl montana cannot predict whether the proposed initiative, will garner enough signatures for placement on the november 2002 statewide ballot, whether there will be a successful legal challenge to the initiative whether it would pass if on the ballot or what impact, if any, the measure might ultimately have upon ppl montana or its hydroelectric operations. ppl montana has declared its opposition to, and intends to vigorously oppose, the initiative. schedule ii - valuation and qualifying accounts and

evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a

preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ pricewaterhousecoopers llp philadelphia, pennsylvania february 25, 2005 report

delivering electricity in its service territory in pennsylvania, ppl electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers in that territory as a plr. as part of the puc final order, ppl electric agreed to supply this electricity at predetermined capped rates through 2009. ppl electric has executed two contracts to purchase electricity from ppl energyplus sufficient for ppl electric to meet its plr obligation through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates. ppl electric's plr obligation after 2009 will be determined by the puc pursuant to plr regulations and a policy statement regarding interpretation and implementation of those regulations. both the regulations and the policy statement became effective in september 2007. refer to "power supply" for additional information, as well as notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements. during 2007, about 95% of ppl electric's operating revenues were derived from regulated electricity delivery and supply as a plr. about 5% of 2007 operating revenues were from wholesale sales, primarily the sale to ppl energyplus of power purchased from nugs. during 2007, about 43% of electricity delivery and plr revenues were from residential customers, 37% from commercial customers, 19% from industrial customers and 1% from other customer classes. ppl electric's transmission facilities are operated as part of pjm, which operates the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. bulk electricity is transmitted to wholesale users throughout a geographic area including all or part of delaware, illinois, indiana, kentucky, maryland, michigan, new jersey, north carolina, ohio, pennsylvania, tennessee, virginia, west virginia and the district of columbia. as of january 1, 2006, ppl electric became a member of the rfc. the purpose of the rfc is to preserve and enhance electric service reliability and security for the interconnected electric systems within its territory and to be a regional entity under the framework of the nerc. the rfc's key functions are the development of regional standards for reliable planning and operation of the bulk electric system and non-discriminatory compliance monitoring and enforcement of both nerc and regional standards. pjm serves as a ferc-approved rto in order to accommodate greater competition and broader participation in the region. an rto, like an iso, is a designation provided by the ferc to a ferc-approved independent entity that operates the transmission system and typically administers a competitive power market. pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary purpose of the rto/iso is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets, but the rto/iso directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. ppl electric is entitled to fully recover from retail customers the charges that it pays to pjm for transmission-related services. pjm imposes these charges pursuant to its ferc-approved open access transmission tariff. ppl electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the puc, and certain of its activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the federal power act. ppl electric also is subject to the jurisdiction of certain federal, regional, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to land use and other environmental matters. certain operations of ppl electric are subject to the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and comparable state statutes. in november 2004, pennsylvania enacted the alternative energy portfolio standards legislation, which requires electric distribution companies, such as ppl electric, and electric generation suppliers serving retail load to ultimately provide 18% of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania from alternative sources within 15 years (by 2020). under this new state legislation, alternative sources include hydro, wind, solar, waste coal, landfill methane and fuel cells. an electric distribution company will pay an alternative compliance payment of $45 for each mwh that it is short of its required alternative energy supply percentage. since ppl electric's plr generation rates are capped through 2009 as described above and the legislation allows for a cost recovery exemption period, ppl electric will not be subject to the requirements of this legislation until 2010. in that year, ppl electric will have to supply about 9% of the total amount of electricity it delivers to its plr customers from alternative energy sources. at this time, ppl electric cannot predict the impact of this legislation on its future results of operations because the impact will depend on a number of factors that will not be known until 2010, including customer load requirements, plr contract terms and available alternative energy sources in the market. in february 2007, the governor of pennsylvania announced an energy independence strategy (strategy). the strategy included initiatives aimed at encouraging the development of energy conservation, energy management and alternative energy resources and proposed the creation of an $850 million energy independence fund (fund) to support the strategy objectives through rebates, grants and loans to qualifying programs. the fund would be capitalized with revenue bonds and financed through a non-bypassable charge on retail electric bills. the strategy also included three initiatives to address plr issues, such as a proposal to phase-in over three years any initial generation rate increase approved by the puc and a requirement that plr providers obtain a "least cost portfolio" of supply by purchasing power in the spot market and through contracts of varying lengths. additionally, providers would be required to procure energy conservation resources before acquiring additional power to meet load growth. in addition, plr providers could enter into long-term contracts with large energy users and alternative energy developers. a special legislative session on energy issues began in september 2007 and is continuing in 2008. the announcement of this strategy and the special legislative session are the first steps in an expected long legislative process involving all of the affected stakeholders. in 2007 and 2008, numerous bills have been introduced on issues incorporated in or related to those addressed by the strategy, including demand-side management measures. it is uncertain at this time whether the details of implementing the strategy, including the issues of deferral of costs and recovery of interest for the customer rate phase-in program and the timing of puc approval for plr supply portfolios, will be included in legislation or delegated to the puc. at this time, ppl cannot predict the final outcome of this legislative and regulatory process or its ultimate impact. see ppl's "results of operations - segment results - pennsylvania delivery segment - 2008 outlook" in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," for additional information regarding ppl electric's efforts to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2009. ppl gas utilities ppl gas utilities was formed in 1946, and ppl acquired it in 1998. ppl gas utilities operates a natural gas distribution and propane business in portions of various counties in pennsylvania, as well as in a small area of maryland and delaware, providing natural gas and propane services to approximately 110,000 customers. ppl gas utilities provides natural gas services in pennsylvania subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the puc. ppl gas utilities also provides intrastate and interstate natural gas storage service from storage fields in pennsylvania. the intrastate storage service is regulated by the puc and the interstate storage service is regulated by the ferc. however, under a 1992 ferc order, rates for interstate storage services are the rates set by the puc for intrastate service. the propane delivery service is not subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the puc or the ferc. in july 2007, ppl completed a review of strategic options for ppl gas utilities and announced its intention to sell these businesses. ppl expects the sale to be completed in the second half of 2008, following execution of a sales agreement and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information. international delivery segment - includes wpd, a regulated electricity distribution company in the u.k. wpd, through indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, operates two electric distribution companies that together serve approximately 2.6 million end-users in the u.k. wpd (south west) serves 1.5 million customers from bristol to bath in a 5,560 square mile area of southwest england. wpd (south wales) serves an area of wales opposite the bristol channel from wpd (south west)'s territory. its 1.1 million customers occupy 4,550 square miles of wales. ppl global had controlling interests in electric transmission and distribution companies serving customers in chile, el salvador and bolivia until their respective sales in 2007. in march 2007, ppl completed a review of strategic options for its latin american businesses and announced its intention to sell them. in may 2007, ppl completed the sale of its el salvadoran business, delsur, for $180 million in cash. in july 2007, ppl sold its bolivian businesses, elfec and integra, to a group organized by local management and employees of the companies. in november 2007, ppl completed the sale of its entire interest in its chilean business, emel, for $660 million in cash. these latin american businesses had served approximately 1.1 million customers. see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information on these sales. seasonality demand for and market prices of electricity are affected by weather. as a result, ppl's overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the nature and location of the facilities ppl owns and the terms of the contracts to purchase or sell electricity. financial condition see ppl's, ppl energy supply's and ppl electric's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for this information. capital expenditure requirements see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources" in ppl's, ppl energy supply's and ppl electric's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information concerning estimated capital expenditure requirements for the years 2008-2012. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information concerning expected capital expenditures for environmental matters. competition the unregulated businesses and markets in which ppl and its subsidiaries participate are highly competitive. over the last 15 years, there has been increased competition in u.s. energy markets because of federal and state deregulation initiatives. for instance, in 1992, the energy act amended the federal power act to provide open access to electric transmission systems for wholesale transactions. in 1996, the customer choice act was enacted in pennsylvania to restructure the state's electric utility industry to create a competitive market for electricity generation. certain other states in which ppl's subsidiaries operate have also adopted "customer choice" plans to allow customers to choose their electricity supplier. ppl and its subsidiaries believe that competition in deregulated energy markets will continue to be intense. see "item 1a. risk factors" for more information concerning the risks ppl faces with respect to competition in the deregulated energy markets. pursuant to ppl electric's authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its distribution business. although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little or no competition with respect to residential customers. see "franchises and licenses" for more information. power supply ppl generation's system capacity (winter rating) at december 31, 2007 was 11,418 mw. the capacity of generating units is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changed circumstances. see "item 2. properties" for a description of ppl generation's plants at december 31, 2007. during 2007, ppl generation's plants generated the following amounts of electricity. state millions of kwh pennsylvania 44,032 montana 8,441 illinois 332 maine 326 connecticut 278 new york 232 total 53,641 this generation represented a 2% increase above the output for 2006. of this generation, 56% of the energy was generated by coal-fired stations, 31% from nuclear operations at the susquehanna station, 8% from hydroelectric stations and 5% from oil/gas-fired stations. ppl estimates that, on average, approximately 91% of its expected annual generation output for the period 2008 through 2009 will be used to meet: ppl energyplus' obligation under two contracts to provide electricity for ppl electric to satisfy its plr obligation under the customer choice act through 2009; ppl energyplus' obligation under contracts to provide electricity to northwestern; and contractual sales to other counterparties for terms of various lengths. ppl has started to and will continue to enter into new power sales contracts over the next few years to obtain firm commitments for a portion of the output of its generating facilities, in advance of the expiration of the plr contracts. ppl has already entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for the years 2010 and beyond. based on developments in the wholesale markets over the last several years, ppl expects that new baseload output contracts are likely to continue to be of a shorter duration than the plr contracts which, at inception, had terms of approximately nine years. these contractual arrangements are consistent with, and are integral to, ppl's supply business strategy to capture profits while managing exposure to adverse movements in energy and fuel prices and counterparty credit risk. this strategy includes matching ppl's anticipated energy supply (including generation as well as purchase commitments) with load, or customer demand, under contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy counterparties. see note 15 to the financial statements for more information regarding ppl's wholesale energy commitments and note 16 for more information regarding the plr contracts. a subsidiary of ppl energy supply funds, develops, constructs, owns and operates plants that produce renewable energy. ppl energyplus markets the energy produced by these plants and renewable energy credits to commercial, industrial and institutional customers. another subsidiary of ppl energy supply has existing projects throughout pennsylvania, new york, new jersey and connecticut, with capacity of approximately 23 mw. during 2007, these projects generated 44 million kwh. ppl energyplus purchases the output from two wind farms in pennsylvania with a combined capacity of 50 mw. a subsidiary of ppl energy supply plans to invest at least $100 million in new renewable projects through 2011. in addition, ppl generation is planning to expand by 156 mw the renewable energy provided by hydroelectric facilities. the cost of this expansion is expected to be $544 million. fuel supply coal and synthetic fuel pennsylvania through december 31, 2007, ppl coal supply, llc (ppl coal supply) provided coal to iris energy llc (iris energy) for the production of synthetic fuel. in 2007, synthetic fuel from iris energy provided 66% of the fuel requirements for three pennsylvania power plants operated by ppl generation. the contract to provide coal to iris energy and the contract for iris energy to supply synthetic fuel to ppl generation, along with the irs synthetic fuel tax credit program, terminated on december 31, 2007. as part of that termination, ppl purchased iris energy's membership interest in ppl coal supply for $7 million. ppl generation's coal supply costs are expected to increase by approximately $20 million in 2008 as a result of the synthetic fuel supply contract ending. effective december 31, 2007, ppl coal supply, which provided the balance of the pennsylvania plants' coal requirements, was merged into ppl generation. ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, actively manages ppl's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in central and northern appalachia. during 2007, ppl coal supply purchased about 92% of the coal delivered to ppl generation's wholly-owned pennsylvania stations under short-term and long-term contracts and obtained 8% through spot market purchases. these contracts provided ppl generation about 7.0 million tons of coal. contracts currently in place are expected to provide approximately 7.3 million tons in 2008. at december 31, 2007, the wholly-owned pennsylvania plants had sufficient supply for about 31 days of operations. the amount of coal in inventory varies from time to time depending on market conditions and plant operations. in 2006, ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, entered into a long-term coal purchase agreement with consol energy inc. the contract will provide more than one-third of ppl generation's projected annual coal needs for the pennsylvania power plants from 2010 through 2018. ppl generation has other contracts that, in total, will provide additional coal supply for ppl's projected annual needs from 2008 through 2012. also at december 31, 2007, a ppl generation subsidiary owned a 12.34% interest in the keystone station and a 16.25% interest in the conemaugh station. the owners of the keystone station had a long-term contract with a synthetic fuel supplier, which terminated at the end of 2007, and provided 4.4 million tons in 2007. the keystone station contracts with keystone fuels, llc for the balance of its requirements. the owners of the conemaugh station also had a long-term contract with a synthetic fuel supplier, which terminated at the end of 2007 and provided 2.6 million tons in 2007. the balance of the conemaugh station requirements is purchased under contract from conemaugh fuels, llc. ppl's share of keystone and conemaugh coal supply costs are expected to increase by $4 million in 2008 due to termination of the synthetic fuel contracts. initial deliveries of limestone in preparation for startup of the scrubbers being installed at the montour power plant began in october 2007. contracts are in place for all the limestone requirements for the four planned scrubbers at ppl generation's wholly-owned pennsylvania stations for 2008 through 2010. when all four scrubbers are fully operational, it is projected that annual limestone requirements will be approximately 700,000 tons. montana ppl montana has a 50% leasehold interest in colstrip units 1 and 2, and a 30% leasehold interest in colstrip unit 3. ppl montana, along with the other owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined quality characteristics and specifications. the current coal supply contract for units 1 and 2 is in effect through december 31, 2009. in 2007, ppl montana entered into a new long-term purchase and supply agreement with the current supplier for units 1 and 2 that will begin january 1, 2010. the new contract will provide these units with 100% of the coal requirements through december 31, 2014, and at least 85% of such requirements from january 1, 2015 through december 31, 2019. the coal supply contract for unit 3 is in effect through december 31, 2019, and will provide 100% of the coal requirements of this unit. coal supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality characteristics and specifications for ppl montana's corette station. the contracts supplied 100% of the plant coal requirements in 2007. similar contracts are currently in place to supply 100% of the expected coal requirements through 2010. oil and natural gas ppl generation's martins creek units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas. ppl energyplus is responsible for procuring the oil and natural gas supply for all ppl generation operations. during 2007, 100% of the physical oil and gas requirements for the martins creek units were purchased on the spot market. as of december 31, 2007, ppl energyplus had no long-term agreements for these oil requirements. as of december 31, 2007, there were no long-term delivery or supply agreements to purchase natural gas for the university park facility. ppl energyplus has a long-term contract for approximately 40% of the expected pipeline transportation requirements of the wallingford facility, but has no long-term supply agreement to purchase natural gas. ppl energyplus has a short-term and long-term gas transportation contract in place for approximately 30% of the maximum daily requirements of the lower mt. bethel facility, but has no long-term supply agreement to purchase natural gas. nuclear the nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. ppl susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services. these contracts are expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of 2012 and unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2013. ppl susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued operation of the nuclear units. federal law requires the federal government to provide for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel. under the nuclear waste policy act (nwpa), the doe initiated an analysis of a site in nevada for a permanent nuclear waste repository. there is no definitive date by which this repository will be operational. as a result, it was necessary to expand susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity. to support this expansion, ppl susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage technology. the facility is modular, so that additional storage capacity can be added as needed. the facility began receiving spent nuclear fuel in 1999. ppl susquehanna estimates that there is sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approximately 2017, under current operating conditions. if necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be discharged through the current licensed life of the plant. in 2002, president bush approved the congressional override of a veto by the state of nevada, designating yucca mountain, nevada, as the site for development of a permanent repository for high-level radioactive waste. the next step is for the doe to submit a license application to the nrc to build and then operate the yucca mountain repository. the doe currently plans to submit a license application by the end of 2008. in 1996, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled that the nwpa imposed on the doe an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel on or before january 31, 1998. in 1997, the court ruled that the contracts between the utilities and the doe provide a potentially adequate remedy if the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by january 31, 1998. the doe did not, in fact, begin to accept spent nuclear fuel on that date. the doe continues to contest claims that its breach of contract resulted in recoverable damages. in january 2004, ppl susquehanna filed suit in the u.s. court of federal claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the doe's breach of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel. ppl cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. provider of last resort supply the customer choice act requires electricity delivery companies, like ppl electric, to act as a plr of electricity and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations to be established by the puc. in may 2007, the puc approved ppl electric's plan to procure default electricity supply in 2010 -- after its current supply agreements with ppl energyplus expire -- for retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier. pursuant to this plan, ppl electric has completed two of six competitive supply solicitations and has contracted for one-third of the 2010 electricity supply it expects to need for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. see ppl's "results of operations - segment results - pennsylvania delivery segment - 2008 outlook" in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," for additional information regarding ppl electric's efforts to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2009. environmental matters certain ppl subsidiaries, including ppl electric and ppl generation subsidiaries, are subject to certain present and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. see ppl's and ppl energy supply's "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources" in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information concerning environmental expenditures during 2007 and estimated expenditures during 2008-2012. certain environmental laws, regulations and developments that may have a substantial impact on ppl are discussed below. see "environmental matters" in note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding these laws and regulations and the status of ppl's and its subsidiaries compliance and remediation activities, as well as legal and regulatory proceedings involving ppl and its subsidiaries. air the clean air act includes, among other things, provisions that: (a) restrict the construction of, and revise the performance standards for, new and substantially modified coal-fired and oil-fired generating stations; and (b) authorize the epa to impose substantial per day noncompliance penalties for each facility found to be in violation of the requirements of an applicable state implementation plan. state agencies administer the epa's air quality regulations through state implementation plans and have concurrent authority to impose penalties for noncompliance. in 2005, the epa finalized its clean air interstate rule (cair) requiring substantial reductions for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions in 28 midwestern and eastern states, including pennsylvania. pursuant to a separate rule finalized in 2005, the epa also required mercury reductions nationwide. however, a federal appeals court has negated the epa mercury rule. the ruling is not expected to affect ppl's current plans to comply with state regulations in pennsylvania and montana. ppl continues to review the federal court opinion to determine whether it has any effect on state regulations in the long term. global climate change there is a growing concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas emissions including, most significantly, carbon dioxide. this concern has led to increased federal legislative proposals, actions at state or local levels, as well as litigation relating to greenhouse gas emissions, including an april 2007 u.s. supreme court decision holding that the epa has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under the clean air act. the epa has also agreed, following this decision, to a remand of new source performance standards (nsps) applicable to stationary sources to reconsider its approach to including greenhouse gases under such rules. if the epa concludes greenhouse gases from motor vehicles pose an endangerment to public health or welfare, this could lead to regulation of stationary source carbon dioxide emissions. the epa might also proceed directly under the nsps to regulate greenhouse gases from stationary sources. also, increased pressure for carbon dioxide emissions reduction is being initiated by investor and environmental organizations and the international community. in addition, a nuisance claim brought by a number of states against other large electric generating companies was dismissed by a federal district court in new york but remains pending on appeal in the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit. ppl believes that the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may have a material impact on its capital expenditures and operations, but the costs are not now determinable. ppl also cannot predict the impact that any pending or future federal or state legislation regarding more stringent environmental standards could have on ppl or its subsidiaries. water to implement the requirements of the federal water pollution control act of 1972, as amended by the clean water act of 1977 and the water quality act of 1987, the epa has adopted regulations on effluent standards for steam electric stations. the states administer the epa's effluent standards through state laws and regulations relating to, among other things, effluent discharges and water quality. the standards adopted by the epa pursuant to the clean water act may have a significant impact on existing facilities of certain ppl subsidiaries, depending on the states' interpretation and future amendments to regulations. the epa plans to finalize the 2008 effluent guidelines plan by august 2008, in which the epa will make a decision about whether to revise the steam electric effluent guidelines. the epa is presently conducting a sampling study of industry discharges to obtain information needed to make that decision. as a result of a u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit decision in january 2007, the epa has withdrawn and is revising its rules for reducing the adverse impact to aquatic organisms during operation of cooling water intakes at existing facilities. while the epa revises the rule, some states are moving forward to independently implement this section of the clean water act. changes the epa will make to the rule in accordance with this decision and the actions of states will likely result in requirements to install technologies to reduce the impact to aquatic life. the cost of these technologies is not now determinable but could be significant. pursuant to the surface mining and reclamation act of 1977, the osm has adopted effluent guidelines which are applicable to ppl subsidiaries as a result of their past coal mining and coal processing activities. the epa and the osm limitations, guidelines and standards also are enforced through the issuance of npdes permits. in accordance with the provisions of the clean water act and the reclamation act of 1977, the epa and the osm have authorized the states to implement the npdes program. compliance with applicable water quality standards is assured by state imposition of npdes permit conditions and requirements to address acid mine drainage. solid and hazardous waste the provisions of superfund authorize the epa to require past and present owners of contaminated sites and generators of any hazardous substance found at a site to clean-up the site or pay the epa or the state for the costs of clean-up. the generators and past owners can be liable even if the generator contributed only a minute portion of the hazardous substances at the site. present owners can be liable even if they contributed no hazardous substances to the site. state laws such as the pennsylvania and montana superfund statutes and the pennsylvania solid waste management act also give state agencies broad authority to identify contaminated sites or sites with waste that has been improperly disposed of, and to order owners or responsible parties to clean-up the sites. if responsible parties cannot or will not perform the clean-up, the agency can hire contractors to clean-up the sites and then require reimbursement from the responsible parties after the clean-up is completed. another pennsylvania statute, the land recycling and environmental remediation standards, encourages voluntary clean-ups by allowing responsible parties to choose from a menu of clean-up standards and providing liability protection commensurate with the clean-up standard chosen. furthermore, the epa and several states, including montana, are considering establishing regulations that could impact the disposal and management of coal combustion products including ash and scrubber wastes and other by-products. ppl cannot predict at this time what impact, if any, such regulations would have on its operating facilities. certain federal and state statutes, including federal and state superfund statutes, also impose liability on the responsible parties for the lost value of damaged natural resources. low-level radioactive waste under federal law, each state is responsible for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated in that state. states may join in regional compacts to jointly fulfill their responsibilities. the states of pennsylvania, maryland, delaware and west virginia are members of the appalachian states low-level radioactive waste compact. efforts to develop a regional disposal facility in pennsylvania were suspended by the pennsylvania dep in 1998. the commonwealth retains the legal authority and may be required to resume the siting process should it be necessary. low-level radioactive waste resulting from the operation of the susquehanna facility is currently being sent to independently operated facilities in barnwell, south carolina, and clive, utah for disposal. in the event these or other emergent disposal options become unavailable or are no longer cost-effective, low-level radioactive waste will be stored on-site at susquehanna, in a facility licensed for that purpose by the nrc. the barnwell facility has announced that it will stop receiving waste from most states, including pennsylvania, in june 2008. beginning at that time, ppl will send most of its low-level radioactive waste to the clive, utah facility and the remainder will be stored at the susquehanna storage facility. ppl susquehanna cannot predict the future availability of independently operated low-level waste disposal facilities or the cost of disposal at such facilities. ppl believes that its licensed storage facility located at susquehanna is sufficient for the foreseeable future to replace the portion of storage capability at the barnwell facility that will not be shifted to clive, utah. electric and magnetic fields concerns have been expressed by some members of the public regarding potential health effects of power frequency emfs, which are emitted by all devices carrying electricity, including electric transmission and distribution lines and substation equipment. government officials in the u.s. and the u.k. have reviewed this issue. the u.s. national institute of environmental health sciences concluded in 2002 that, for most health outcomes, there is no evidence that emfs cause adverse effects. the agency further noted that there is some epidemiological evidence of an association with childhood leukemia, but that the evidence is difficult to interpret without supporting laboratory evidence. the u.k. national radiological protection board (part of the u.k. health protection agency) concluded in 2004 that, while the research on emfs does not provide a basis to find that emfs cause any illness, there is a basis to consider precautionary measures beyond existing exposure guidelines. in april 2007, the stakeholder group on extremely low frequency emf, set up by the u.k. government, issued its interim assessment, which describes a number of options for reducing public exposure to emfs. this assessment is being considered by the u.k. government. ppl and its subsidiaries believe the current efforts to determine whether emfs cause adverse health effects should continue and are taking steps to reduce emfs, where practical, in the design of new transmission and distribution facilities. ppl and its subsidiaries are unable to predict what effect, if any, the emf issue might have on their operations and facilities either in the u.s. or the u.k., and the associated cost, or what, if any, liabilities they might incur related to the emf issue. general ppl and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities and operations. in complying with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including the areas of water and air quality, hazardous and solid waste handling and disposal and toxic substances, ppl's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain of their facilities. ppl's subsidiaries may also incur significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but could be significant. franchises and licenses ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies to which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. see "background - supply segment" for a discussion of ppl energyplus' licenses in various states. ppl energyplus also has an export license from the doe to sell capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in canada. ppl susquehanna operates units 1 and 2 pursuant to nrc operating licenses. in september 2006, ppl susquehanna applied to the nrc for 20-year license renewals for each of the susquehanna units to extend their expiration dates, from 2022 to 2042 for unit 1 and from 2024 to 2044 for unit 2. ppl cannot predict whether or when nrc approval will be obtained. in december 2007, ppl announced that ppl susquehanna will ask the nrc to approve a cola for a new nuclear generating unit to be built adjacent to the susquehanna plant. see note 9 to financial statements for additional information. ppl holtwood operates the holtwood hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license renewed by the ferc in 1980 and expiring in 2014. ppl holtwood operates the wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license renewed by the ferc in 2005 and expiring in 2044. ppl holtwood also owns one-third of the capital stock of safe harbor water power corporation (safe harbor), which holds a project license that extends the operation of its hydroelectric generating station until 2030. the total capacity of the safe harbor generating station is 420 mw, and ppl holtwood is entitled by contract to one-third of the total capacity. in december 2007, ppl asked the ferc for permission to expand its holtwood plant by 125 mw. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information. the 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir purchased from montana power in 1999 are licensed by the ferc. these licenses expire periodically, and the generating facilities must be relicensed at such times. the current ferc license for the mystic facility expires in 2009; the thompson falls and kerr licenses expire in 2025 and 2035, respectively; and the licenses for the nine missouri-madison facilities expire in 2040. in december 2007, the ferc issued a new license for the mystic facility for a 40-year term, effective january 1, 2010. in connection with the relicensing of these generation facilities, the ferc may, under applicable law, relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee, or the u.s. government may take over the facility. if the original licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing. wpd is located in the u.k. and is authorized by the u.k. government to provide electric distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. for instance, wpd is subject to governmental regulation of the prices it can charge and the quality of service it must provide, and wpd can be fined or even have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service. wpd operates under distribution licenses granted, and price controls set, by ofgem. the price control formula that governs wpd's allowed revenue is normally determined every five years. the most recent review was completed in late-2004, and new prices became effective april 1, 2005. employee relations as of december 31, 2007, ppl and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees. ppl energy supply ppl generation 2,674 ppl energyplus 2,197 (a) ppl global domestic 8 international (wpd) 2,334 total ppl energy supply 7,213 ppl electric 2,238 ppl gas utilities 373 ppl services &amp; other 1,325 total ppl 11,149 (a) includes union employees of mechanical contracting subsidiaries, whose number tends to fluctuate due to the nature of this business. approximately 61%, or 5,339, of ppl's domestic workforce are members of labor unions, with four ibew locals representing 3,643 employees. the other unions primarily represent employees of the mechanical contractors and gas utility employees in pennsylvania. the bargaining agreement with the largest union was negotiated in may 2006 and expires in may 2010. nine four-year contracts with smaller gas utility locals in pennsylvania were negotiated in 2007. in june 2004, the ibew representing 245 employees at the montana colstrip power plant approved a four-year labor agreement expiring in june 2008. in january 2008, a four-year contract expiring in april 2012 was negotiated with an ibew local in montana that represents 86 employees at the hydroelectric plants and at the corette plant. approximately 84%, or 1,953, of ppl's international workforce are members of labor unions. wpd recognizes five unions, the largest of which represents 37% of union members. wpd's electricity business agreement covers 1,897 union employees; it may be amended by agreement between wpd and the unions and is terminable with 12 months notice by either side. available information ppl's internet web site is www.pplweb.com. on the investor center page of that web site, ppl provides access to all sec filings of ppl registrants free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec. additionally, ppl registrants' filings are available at the sec's web site (www.sec.gov) and at the sec's public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, dc 20549, or by calling 1-800-sec-0330. item 1a. risk factors ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric face various risks associated with our businesses. while we have tried to identify below the risks we currently consider material, these risks are not the only risks that we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. in addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 15 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. as used in this item 1a., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to ppl energy supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the supply and international delivery segment discussions, or ppl electric and ppl gas utilities and their consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania delivery segment discussion. risks related to supply segment ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) adverse changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. our energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power exceed our costs of supplying power, are impacted by changes in the market prices for electricity, as well as fluctuations in the prices for fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, renewable energy credits, electricity transmission and related congestion charges and other costs. unlike most other commodities, there is limited ability to store electric power and it must be consumed at the time of production. as a result, the wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable. among the factors that can influence such prices are: demand for electricity and supplies of electricity available from current or new generation resources; variable production costs, primarily fuel (and the associated fuel transportation costs) and emission allowance expense, for the generation resources used to meet the demand for electricity; transmission capacity and service into, or out of, markets served; changes in the regulatory framework for wholesale power markets; liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, as well as general credit worthiness of key participants in the market; and weather conditions impacting demand for electricity or the facilities necessary to deliver electricity. see exhibit 99(b) for more information concerning the market fluctuations in wholesale energy, fuel and emission allowance prices over the past five years. whether we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into or renew long-term power sales and fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements in order to mitigate market price and supply risk may affect our earnings. as a result of the plr contracts and certain other agreements, a substantial portion of our anticipated generation production and capacity value is currently committed through 2009 under power sales agreements of various terms that include fixed prices for our electric power. in connection with such agreements, we have entered into longer-term fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements that include fixed prices for a significant portion of our forecasted needs. whether we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into such agreements or renew existing agreements and the market conditions at that time will affect our financial performance. for instance, in the absence of long-term power sales agreements, we would sell the energy, capacity and other products from our facilities into the competitive wholesale power markets under contracts of shorter duration at then-current market prices. although the current forward prices for electricity significantly exceed the prices available under some of our current power sales agreements, this situation may not continue. in addition, if we do not secure or maintain favorable fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements for our power generation facilities, our fuel costs (and the associated fuel transportation costs) could exceed the revenues that we derive from our energy sales. given the volatility and potential for material differences between actual electricity prices and fuel and other costs, if we do not secure or maintain long-term electricity sales and fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements, our margins will be subject to increased volatility and, depending on future electricity and fuel costs (and the associated fuel transportation costs), our financial results may be materially adversely affected. marketing energy for the period after expiration of the plr contracts poses other risks to the supply segment. the existing full requirements plr contracts between ppl energyplus and ppl electric expire at the end of 2009. in connection with ppl electric's puc-approved procurement plan for default electricity supply in 2010 for retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier, ppl energyplus was one of the successful bidders in the first competitive solicitation process and in july 2007 entered into an agreement with ppl electric to supply up to 671 mw of total peak load in 2010, at an average price of $91.42 per mwh. at this time, we cannot predict the extent to which ppl energyplus will sell additional power to ppl electric after 2009. in anticipation of the expiration of the plr contracts at the end of 2009, our energy marketing and trading operation continues to enter into other new supply contracts for the post-2009 period, including bilateral and load-following contracts with new counterparties at market prices. the electricity supply obligations under these new contracts will be met by generation we own and electricity and other energy-related products purchased from other parties. in connection with these activities and as part of the continued expansion of our energy marketing and trading operation, we are hedging the future energy production capability of our generation facilities and the related fuel costs; buying and selling energy, capacity, fuel, transmission and other products in the wholesale energy markets; and entering into various forms of financial and physical contracts to capture additional energy margins as well as to hedge various exposures in our generation portfolio and generally manage risk. all of the above hedging and trading activity may cause volatility in future cash flows and results of operations. disruptions in our fuel supplies could occur, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our generation facilities. we purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. our generation facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our financial performance. our ability to manage operational risk with respect to our generation plants is critical to our financial performance. operation of our power plants at expected capacity levels involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, labor disputes and fuel interruption. in addition, weather and natural disasters can disrupt our generation plants. weather conditions also have a direct impact on the river flows required to operate our hydroelectric plants at expected capacity levels. depending on the timing and duration of both planned and unplanned complete or partial outages at our power plants (in particular, if such outages are during peak periods or during periods of, or caused by, severe weather), our revenues from energy sales could be significantly decreased and our expenses significantly increased, and we could be required to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our energy sales commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for our failure to satisfy them. many of our generating units are reaching mid-life, and we are faced with the potential for more frequent unplanned outages and the possibility of planned outages of longer duration to accommodate significant investments in major component replacements at these facilities. changes in technology may impair the value of our power plants. a basic premise of our business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low price. there are alternate technologies for producing electricity, most notably fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells. research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in the alternate technologies. it is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternate methods of electric production to a level that is equal to or below that of most central station electric production. also, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and the pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by customers could change, thus allowing them to reduce their purchases and the corresponding revenues that the generators receive. if this were to happen, the value of our generation facilities may be significantly impaired. we rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control to deliver our wholesale electricity and natural gas. if transmission is disrupted, or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver power may be hindered. we depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to the wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric generation facilities. if transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by isos, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or we may be unable to sell products on the most favorable terms. the ferc has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that sufficient transmission capacity will not be available to transmit electricity as we desire. we cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether isos in applicable markets will operate the transmission networks, and provide related services, efficiently. the plr contracts do not provide for a specific level of supply and demand significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy margins. ppl electric is obligated to provide electricity supply to its plr customers at predetermined capped rates through 2009 and has entered into puc-approved, full requirements energy supply agreements with ppl energyplus at the rates ppl electric is entitled to charge its plr customers in order to fulfill its plr obligation. if ppl electric's customers obtain electricity from alternate suppliers, which they are entitled to do at any time, ppl energyplus' sales of electricity under the plr contracts may decrease. alternatively, demand that we satisfy pursuant to the plr contracts could increase as a result of severe weather conditions, economic development or other reasons over which we have no control. we satisfy our electricity supply obligations through a portfolio approach of providing electricity from our generation assets, contractual relationships and market purchases. at december 31, 2007, the plr requirements required about 80% of the normal operating capacity of our existing pennsylvania generation assets . a significant increase in demand would adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of the plr contracts to provide the energy supply to fulfill this increased demand at the capped rates, which we expect to remain significantly below the wholesale prices at which we would have to purchase the additional supply if needed or, if we had available capacity, the prices at which we could otherwise sell the additional supply. accordingly, any significant increase in demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. we face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. unlike our regulated delivery businesses, our energy supply business is not assured of any rate of return on our capital investments through predetermined rates, and our revenues and results of operations are dependent on our ability to operate in a competitive environment. an important focus of our supply business over the next several years will be the enhancement and expansion of our wholesale marketing and trading of electricity and related products and services, but we may not be successful because of the intense competition that we face in the deregulated electricity markets. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of regulatory authorities and other factors. these competitive factors may negatively impact our ability to sell electricity and related products and services and the prices which we may charge for such products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow our business. following the expiration of our existing power sales agreements, we currently expect to sell our available energy and capacity into the competitive wholesale markets through contracts of various durations. competition in the wholesale power markets will occur principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and availability. we expect the commencement of commercial operation of new electric facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity will continue to increase the competitiveness of the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have a material adverse effect on the prices we receive for electricity. we also face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary services. we primarily compete with other electricity merchants based on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. we also compete against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to credit sources, and many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have. competitors in the wholesale power markets in which ppl generation subsidiaries and ppl energyplus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators and unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities. in the past, puhca significantly restricted mergers and acquisitions and other investments in the electric utility sector. entirely new competitors, including financial institutions, may enter the energy markets as a result of the repeal of puhca. the repeal of puhca also may lead to consolidation in our industry, resulting in competitors with significantly greater financial resources than we have. if the present trend towards competitive markets is reversed, discontinued or delayed, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. some deregulated electricity markets have experienced supply problems and price volatility. in some of these markets, state legislators, government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to delay market restructuring, change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of these markets that have previously been deregulated or permit electricity delivery companies to construct or acquire generating facilities. in certain states, elements and implications of the electricity market restructurings are being investigated by legislators and regulators or are the subject of ongoing litigation. in 2001, the ferc instituted a series of price controls designed to mitigate (or cap) prices in the entire western u.s. to address the extreme volatility in the california electricity markets. these price controls have had the effect of significantly lowering spot and forward electricity prices in the western market. in addition, the isos that oversee the transmission systems in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. these types of price limitations and other mechanisms may reduce the profits that our wholesale power marketing and trading business would have realized based on competitive market conditions absent such limitations and mechanisms. although we generally expect electricity markets to continue to be competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our industry may be made, and legislative or other action affecting the electric power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or reversed in the states in which we currently, or may in the future, operate. at this time, there are various ongoing regulatory and legislative activities in pennsylvania regarding plr supply after 2009. we cannot predict the final outcome of these regulatory and legislative activities or their ultimate impact on ppl and ppl energy supply, along with ppl electric. for additional information on plr issues after 2009, see "conditions affecting ppl electric's plr supply after 2009 are currently uncertain" under the "risks related to pennsylvania delivery segment" discussion. we are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale electricity markets. we purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based tariffs authorized by the ferc throughout the united states and also enter into short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price fluctuations. if we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay damages. these damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of the undelivered capacity or electricity. depending on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be significant. extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, transmissions disruptions, and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and electricity. in addition, our power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post collateral for the benefit of the counterparties if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices by certain thresholds. at december 31, 2007, we posted $469 million of collateral, in the form of letters of credit, under these contracts. although we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity facilities to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these contracts, we increased our available liquidity facilities to $3.9 billion in 2007, in order to satisfy these collateral obligations and to maintain our credit ratings. the increase was needed, in significant part, due to the potential collateral requirements under these contracts, and to support contracts that we expect to enter as we seek to expand our wholesale marketing and trading business, including power contracts for the sale of electricity that will become available following the expiration of our plr contracts with ppl electric. we also face credit risk that parties with whom we contract will default in their performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the time of contract. whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means, including through agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices beyond certain thresholds. however, there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance. counterparty nonperformance could adversely impact our ability to fully meet our obligations to other parties, which could in turn subject us to claims for damages. we do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price volatility. we attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity sales arrangements by either reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and services through the competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts. we also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to weather conditions, fuel requirements and other electricity-related commodities. however, based on economic and other considerations, we may not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. our risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency and counterparties, may not work as planned, and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs. we actively manage the market risk inherent in our energy-related, debt, foreign currency and counterparty credit positions. we have implemented procedures to enhance and monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs, including validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of various risk measurement metrics. nonetheless, our risk management programs may not work as planned. for instance, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management positions. similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not set up to address. as a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events lead to greater losses or costs than our risk management positions were intended to hedge. if our risk management positions are ineffective in this way, we could be subject to mark-to-market accounting with respect to certain of our risk management contracts, which could lead to significant volatility in our earnings and our financial position. in addition, our trading, marketing and risk management activities are exposed to the credit risk that counterparties that owe us money, electricity or fuel will breach their obligations. we have established a risk management policy and programs, including credit risk programs, to evaluate counterparty credit risk. however, if counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices. in that event, our financial results are likely to be adversely affected. despite federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or prevent or delay operation of our facilities. our u.s. generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market. generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the ferc. the ferc has authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices. the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not workably competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates. any reduction by the ferc in the rates we may receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations. see "ferc market-based rate authority" in note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the ferc's market-based rate authority program. in addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals. if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to additional costs. we are actively pursuing growth of generation capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. we are actively pursuing expansion of our generation capacity over the next several years through power uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the potential construction of new power plants and the potential acquisition of existing plants. the acquisition, development and construction of additional generation capacity through any of these means involve numerous risks. any planned power uprates could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs. with respect to the construction of new plants or the acquisition of existing plants, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses in preparation for competitive bids that we may not win or before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. the success of both a new project and a newly-acquired plant would likely be contingent upon, among other things, the negotiation of satisfactory fuel supply and power sales contracts, as well as acceptable financing conditions. our success in developing a new plant or expanding existing generation capacity would likely be contingent upon, among other things, negotiation of satisfactory engineering and construction contracts, receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals and satisfactory completion of construction. if we were unable to complete the construction or expansion of a facility, we would generally not be able to recover our investment in the project. furthermore, we may be unable to run any new or acquired plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings. for example, as discussed in more detail in note 9 to the financial statements, we have announced our intention to file a cola with the nrc by the end of 2008 to construct a new nuclear unit. we are making substantial expenditures on this cola process, but we have not yet committed to construction of this new nuclear unit and such construction is subject to numerous uncertainties. in addition to the general uncertainties discussed above for our generation expansion plans, these uncertainties include nrc and other governmental approvals, potential public opposition, the continuing nrc review of the evolutionary power reactor technology involved, the cost and availability of acceptable financing including under the doe's loan guarantee and other governmental programs, acceptable arrangements with project partners and vendors, schedule delays, legislative and regulatory changes, competitive market structure and the prospect for cost recovery, among other factors. our costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital expenditures on pollution control measures that, if delayed, would adversely affect our profitability and liquidity. our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection. to comply with existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control measures we may take, we expect to spend substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and compliance. as a result of existing and recently-enacted federal environmental laws and regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-burning plants, ppl's current installation plan for the scrubbers and other pollution control equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate, nitrogen oxides and mercury emissions reduction) through 2012 reflects a total estimated cost of approximately $1.6 billion, of which ppl has already spent $0.9 billion. while installation of this pollution control equipment remains on schedule, a delay in such installation could require us to purchase additional pollution control emission allowances at market prices or decrease the expected value of excess emission allowances that we could sell at market prices as a result of the scheduled installation of this equipment. such a delay also could require us to burn higher cost, lower sulfur coal at these facilities. many states and environmental groups have challenged certain of the federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict. as a result, it is possible that state and federal regulations will be developed that will impose more stringent limitations on emissions than are currently in effect, which could require us to incur significantly greater capital expenditures for pollution control equipment. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for our planned capital projects or which are otherwise necessary to our business. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. furthermore, at some of our older facilities it may be uneconomical for us to install the necessary equipment, which may cause us to shut down those generation units. there also is growing concern nationally and internationally about carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions (including concern about global warming). various legislative proposals are being considered in congress, and several states already have passed legislation capping carbon dioxide emissions. for more information regarding environmental matters, including the existing and proposed federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations to which we are subject, see "environmental matters - domestic" in note 15 to the financial statements. we are subject to the risks of nuclear generation, including the risk that our susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to revised security or safety requirements that would increase our capital and operating expenditures, and uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its licensed life. nuclear generation accounted for about 31% of our 2007 generation output. the risks of nuclear generation generally include: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, as well as security-related and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. in the event of noncompliance, the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. in addition, revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital or operating expenditures at our susquehanna nuclear plant. in addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our susquehanna plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational loss, damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. risks related to international delivery segment ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) our u.k. delivery business is also subject to risks with respect to rate regulation and operational performance. our u.k. delivery business is rate-regulated. in addition, its ability to manage operational risk is critical to its financial performance. accordingly, this business is subject to the same general risks as those described below under "risks related to pennsylvania delivery segment." our u.k. delivery business exposes us to risks related to laws of other countries, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, political and regulatory conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks may reduce our results of operations from our delivery business. the acquisition, financing, development and operation of projects in the u.k. entail significant financial risks, including: changes in foreign laws or regulations relating to foreign operations, including tax laws and regulations; changes in united states laws related to foreign operations, including tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies; severe weather and natural disaster impacts on the electric sector and our assets; changes in labor relations in foreign operations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and in converting foreign revenues to u.s. dollars, which can increase our expenses and/or impair our ability to meet such expenses, and difficulty moving funds out of the country in which the funds were earned; limitations on the ability to import or export property and equipment; and compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws. risks related to pennsylvania delivery segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) regulators may not approve the rates we request. our pennsylvania delivery business is rate-regulated. while such regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs, including energy supply costs for customers, and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the rates that we may charge our delivery customers are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities. there is no guarantee that the rates authorized by regulators will match our actual costs or provide a particular return on invested capital at any given time. our transmission and distribution facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our financial performance. our ability to manage operational risk with respect to our transmission and distribution systems is critical to the financial performance of our delivery business. our delivery business also faces several risks, including the breakdown or failure of or damage to equipment or processes (especially due to severe weather or natural disasters), accidents and labor disputes and other factors. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. we are subject to higher transmission costs and other risks as a result of pjm's regional transmission expansion plan (rtep) process. pjm and the ferc have the authority to require upgrades or expansion of the regional transmission grid, which can result in substantial expenditures for transmission owners. as discussed in note 9 to the financial statements, we will be making substantial expenditures to construct a major new transmission line that pjm has determined is necessary for the reliability of the regional transmission grid. although we have applied to the ferc for incentive rate treatment of such facilities, we cannot predict the ultimate cost and regulatory treatment. we also cannot predict the in-service schedule for these facilities or whether delays may occur due to public opposition and other factors. delays could result in significant cost increases for these facilities and decreased reliability of the regional transmission grid. as a result, we cannot predict the ultimate financial or operational impact of this project or other rtep projects on ppl electric. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. under the energy policy act, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are now subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the nerc and enforced by the ferc. compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures, and violations of these standards could result in substantial penalties. as discussed in note 15 to the financial statements, as a result of its self-reporting to the rfc of a potential violation of certain reliability standards, ppl electric could be subject to substantial penalties for such violation. ppl electric generally bears the risk, through 2009, that it will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply at the predetermined capped rates it may charge to its plr customers. in order to mitigate the risk that we will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates we may charge to our plr customers, we have entered into puc-approved, full requirements energy supply agreements with ppl energyplus at these capped rates. under one of the plr contracts, we are required to make performance assurance deposits with ppl energyplus when the market price of electricity is less than the contract price by more than our contract collateral threshold. conversely, ppl energyplus is required to make performance assurance deposits with us when the market price of electricity is greater than the contract price by more than its contract collateral threshold. over the past few years, market prices for electricity have exceeded the contract price, and we estimated that, at december 31, 2007, the market price of electricity exceeded the contract price in total by approximately $2.5 billion. accordingly, at december 31, 2007, ppl energyplus was required to provide us with performance assurance of $300 million, the maximum amount of collateral required under the contract. if ppl energyplus is unable to satisfy its energy supply obligations to us under the plr contracts, we would be required to obtain energy supply in the wholesale market at then-current market rates to meet our plr obligation. while the customer choice act provides generally for plr costs to be borne by customers, it is not clear whether we would be able to pass on to our customers any costs of this replacement energy supply that exceed the predetermined capped rates. conditions affecting ppl electric's plr supply after 2009 are currently uncertain. uncertainty driven by potential changes in the regulatory treatment of ppl electric's plr obligation after 2009 when its full requirements contracts with ppl energyplus expire presents a risk for the electricity delivery business. the customer choice act requires electricity delivery companies, like ppl electric, to act as a plr of electricity and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations to be established by the puc. there are a number of ongoing regulatory and legislative activities that may affect ppl electric's recovery of supply costs after 2009. in may 2007, the puc approved ppl electric's plan to procure default electricity supply in 2007-2009 for retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier in 2010. pursuant to this plan, ppl electric has contracted for one-third of the 2010 electricity supply it expects to need for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. in november 2007, ppl electric filed a plan with the puc, which is still pending, under which its residential and small commercial customers, beginning in mid-2008, could begin to pay in advance to smooth the impact of price increases when generation rate caps expire in 2010. in september 2007, the puc regulations regarding the obligation of pennsylvania electric utilities to provide default electricity supply in 2011 and beyond became effective. later this year, ppl electric plans to file for puc approval of its post-2010 supply procurement plan under these regulations. in addition to this regulatory activity, the governor of pennsylvania has proposed an energy independence strategy which, among other things, contains initiatives to address plr issues including a requirement that plrs will obtain a "least-cost portfolio" of electric supply. the pennsylvania legislature has convened and continues a special session to address the proposals in the governor's strategy and other energy issues. in addition, certain pennsylvania legislators have introduced legislation to extend generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for pennsylvania utilities beyond the end of their transition periods, which in ppl electric's case is december 31, 2009. ppl and ppl electric have expressed strong concern regarding the severe potential consequences of such legislation on customer service, system reliability, adequate future generation supply and ppl electric's financial viability. if such legislation or similar legislation is enacted, ppl electric could be faced with severe financial impacts including operating losses and significant cash flow shortfalls. in addition, continuing uncertainty regarding ppl electric's ability to recover its market supply and other costs of operating its business after 2009 could adversely impact its credit quality, financing costs and availability of credit facilities necessary to operate its business. whether we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into power purchase contracts in order to mitigate market price and delivery risk, and our ability to recover costs associated with such contracts, may affect our earnings. in order to mitigate the risk that we will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply after 2009, when the full requirements energy supply agreements with ppl energyplus expire, we have entered into power purchase agreements that include fixed prices. whether we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into such agreements and the market conditions at that time will affect our financial performance. for instance, in the absence of power purchase agreements, we would purchase the energy, capacity and other products in the competitive wholesale power markets at then-current market prices. the current forward prices for electricity exceed the prices available under some of our current power sales agreements, and our financial performance will be affected by our ability to enter into new supply contracts, the duration and pricing of such contracts relative to prevailing market conditions, and the regulatory treatment for such contracts and the associated recovery of our supply costs. depending on these factors, our financial results may be materially adversely affected. other risks related to all segments ( ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric ) our operating results could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of severe weather conditions. our businesses are seasonal. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during the hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in the cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when severe weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold weather or storms make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the nature and location of the facilities we acquire or develop and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity. we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "legal matters," "regulatory issues" and in "environmental matters - domestic" in note 15 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. we may need significant additional financing to pursue growth opportunities. we continually review potential acquisitions and development projects and may enter into significant acquisition agreements or development commitments in the future. an acquisition agreement or development commitment may require access to substantial capital from outside sources on acceptable terms. we also may need external financing to fund capital expenditures, including capital expenditures necessary to comply with environmental regulations or other regulatory requirements. our ability to arrange financing and our cost of capital are dependent on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, credit availability and our financial performance. the inability to obtain sufficient financing on terms that are acceptable to us could adversely affect our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and fund capital expenditures. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. our current credit ratings by moody's, fitch and s&amp;p are listed in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources." while we do not expect these ratings to limit our ability to fund our short-term liquidity needs and/or access any new long-term debt, any ratings downgrades could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund our short-term liquidity needs and access new long-term debt. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including our health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting, and reducing where possible, our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations, including with respect to materials and labor costs as a result of general inflation, increased nationwide plant construction and other factors. in addition, pursuant to our collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to current employees and retirees covered by the contracts. we provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in the last few years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to continue to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to experience significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our costs could be significantly increased. there is a risk that we may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings. under gaap, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. while no goodwill impairments were required based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2007, we are unable to predict whether any impairment charges may be necessary in the future. we also review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. during 2007, ppl impaired certain transmission rights, certain domestic telecommunications assets, certain assets of the natural gas distribution and propane businesses, and the net assets of our bolivian businesses prior to their sale in july. during 2006, ppl recorded a loss on the sale of our interest in the griffith plant and fully impaired our synfuel-related assets. see notes 9, 10 and 15 to the financial statements. in addition, we are in the process of selling our natural gas distribution and propane businesses, which may result in a loss on sale. we are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in the future. quantitative and

criteria). ppl corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting at item 9a. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. in our opinion, ppl corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2007,

ppl energy supply owned or controlled generation capacity ppl energy supply owned or controlled generating capacity of 12,002 mw at december 31, 2008. through subsidiaries, ppl generation owns and operates power plants in pennsylvania, montana, illinois, connecticut, new york and maine. the total owned or controlled generating capacity includes power obtained through ppl energyplus's tolling or power purchase agreements (including ironwood and other facilities that consist of nugs, wind farms and landfill facilities). see "item 2. properties" for a complete listing of ppl energy supply's generating capacity. pennsylvania generation had a total capacity of 9,785 mw at december 31, 2008. these plants are fueled by uranium, coal, natural gas, oil, water and other fuels. the electricity from these plants is sold to ppl energyplus under ferc-jurisdictional power purchase agreements. ppl energy supply's u.s. generation subsidiaries are ewgs, which sell electricity into the wholesale market. ppl energy supply's ewgs are subject to regulation by the ferc, which has authorized these ewgs to sell generation from their facilities at market-based prices. ppl susquehanna, a subsidiary of ppl generation, owns a 90% undivided interest in each of the two nuclear-fueled generating units at its susquehanna station; allegheny electric cooperative, inc. owns the remaining 10% undivided interest. ppl's 90% share of susquehanna's generating capacity was 2,165 mw at december 31, 2008. ppl generation operates its pennsylvania, new jersey and illinois power plants in conjunction with pjm. ppl generation's pennsylvania power plants, ppl generation's illinois 574 mw natural gas-fired generating station and ppl energyplus are members of the rfc. refer to "pennsylvania delivery segment" for information regarding pjm's operations and functions and the rfc. the montana coal-fired and hydroelectric-powered stations have a capacity of 1,287 mw. ppl montana's power plants are parties to the western electricity coordinating council agreement. the maine oil-fired and hydroelectric-powered stations have a total capacity of 102 mw. the maine generating assets are operated in conjunction with iso new england and are parties to the northeast power coordinating council agreement. see note 9 for information on the possible sale of three hydroelectric dams. the connecticut natural gas-fired station has a total capacity of 252 mw, is operated in conjunction with iso new england and is party to the northeast power coordinating council agreement. the new york natural gas-fired generating stations have a combined capacity of 159 mw. these generating stations are operated in connection with the new york iso and are parties to the northeast power coordinating council agreement. tolling agreements are in place for 100% of the capacity and output of these stations. ppl generation has current plans to implement capital projects at certain of its generation facilities in pennsylvania, maine and montana that would provide 148 mw of additional generation capacity for its use by 2013. see "item 2. properties" for additional information regarding these capital projects. refer to the "power supply" section for additional information regarding electricity generated by the various power plants operated by ppl generation and to the "fuel supply" section for a discussion of fuel requirements and contractual arrangements for fuel. a subsidiary of ppl energy supply develops renewable energy plants on various sites using technologies such as small turbines, reciprocating engines and photovoltaic solar panels. as of december 31, 2008, another subsidiary of ppl energy supply owned approximately 32 mw of installed capacity from these projects, serving commercial and industrial customers. ppl generation's subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of certain federal, regional, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. ppl susquehanna is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of the susquehanna units. certain of ppl generation's other subsidiaries, including ppl montana, are subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of their fossil plants with respect to certain level and density monitoring devices. certain operations of ppl generation's subsidiaries are subject to the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and comparable state statutes. energy marketing ppl energyplus markets or brokers the electricity produced by ppl generation subsidiaries, along with purchased power, ftrs, natural gas, oil, emission allowances and renewable energy credits in competitive wholesale and deregulated retail markets in order to take advantage of opportunities in the competitive energy marketplace. ppl energyplus purchases and sells electric capacity and energy at the wholesale level at competitive prices under ferc market-based prices. ppl energyplus enters into these agreements to market available energy and capacity from ppl generation's assets and to profit from market price fluctuations. ppl energyplus actively manages its portfolios to maximize the value of ppl's generating assets and to limit exposure to price fluctuations. ppl energyplus also purchases and sells energy forward and futures contracts as well as other commodity-based financial instruments in accordance with ppl's risk management policies, objectives and strategies. ppl energyplus has executed contracts to provide electricity to ppl electric sufficient for it to meet its plr obligation through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates ppl electric is entitled to charge its customers during this period. this arrangement with ppl electric accounted for 28% of ppl energy supply's operating revenues in 2008. see note 16 to the financial statements for more information concerning these contracts. ppl energyplus currently is licensed to provide retail electric supply to customers in delaware, maine, massachusetts, maryland, montana, new jersey and pennsylvania. in 2008, ppl energyplus provided energy to industrial customers in montana. ppl energyplus serves natural gas customers in pennsylvania, new jersey and delaware and is licensed to do so in maryland. an indirect subsidiary of ppl energyplus owned two production facilities that, until december 31, 2007, manufactured synthetic fuel from coal or coal byproducts. ppl received federal tax credits for these qualified manufactured solid synthetic fuel products. ppl retired these facilities in 2008. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information. in 2007, ppl sold ppl telcom, llc, an indirect subsidiary of ppl energyplus, which offered fiber optic capacity to telecommunication companies and enterprise customers. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information. pennsylvania delivery segment - includes the regulated electric delivery operations of ppl electric. ppl electric ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central pennsylvania. the largest cities in this territory are allentown, bethlehem, harrisburg, hazleton, lancaster, scranton, wilkes-barre and williamsport. in addition to delivering electricity in its service territory in pennsylvania, ppl electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers in that territory as a plr. as part of the puc final order, ppl electric agreed to supply this electricity at predetermined capped rates through 2009. ppl electric has executed two contracts to purchase electricity from ppl energyplus sufficient for ppl electric to meet its plr obligation through 2009, at the predetermined capped rates. ppl electric's plr obligation after 2009 will be determined by the puc pursuant to plr regulations and a policy statement regarding interpretation and implementation of those regulations. both the regulations and the policy statement became effective in september 2007. refer to "power supply" for additional information, as well as notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements. during 2008, about 97% of ppl electric's operating revenues were derived from regulated electricity delivery and supply as a plr. about 3% of 2008 operating revenues were from wholesale revenues, primarily the sale to ppl energyplus of power purchased from nugs. during 2008, about 45% of electricity delivery and plr revenues were from residential customers, 36% from commercial customers, 18% from industrial customers and 1% from other customer classes. ppl electric's transmission facilities are operated as part of pjm, which operates the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. bulk electricity is transmitted to wholesale users throughout a geographic area including all or part of delaware, illinois, indiana, kentucky, maryland, michigan, new jersey, north carolina, ohio, pennsylvania, tennessee, virginia, west virginia and the district of columbia. as of january 1, 2006, ppl electric became a member of the rfc. the purpose of the rfc is to preserve and enhance electric service reliability and security for the interconnected electric systems within its territory and to be a regional entity under the framework of the nerc. the rfc's key functions are the development of regional standards for reliable planning and operation of the bulk electric system and non-discriminatory compliance monitoring and enforcement of both nerc and regional standards. pjm serves as a ferc-approved rto in order to accommodate greater competition and broader participation in the region. an rto, like an iso, is a designation provided by the ferc to a ferc-approved independent entity that operates the transmission system and typically administers a competitive power market. pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary purpose of the rto/iso is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets, but the rto/iso directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. ppl electric is entitled to fully recover from retail customers the charges that it pays to pjm for transmission-related services. pjm imposes these charges pursuant to its ferc-approved open access transmission tariff. ppl electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the puc, and certain of its activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the federal power act. ppl electric also is subject to the jurisdiction of certain federal, regional, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to land use and other environmental matters. certain operations of ppl electric are subject to the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and comparable state statutes. in november 2004, pennsylvania enacted the alternative energy portfolio standard (the aeps) legislation, which requires electric distribution companies, such as ppl electric, and retail electric suppliers serving retail load to ultimately provide 18% of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania from alternative sources by 2020. under this state legislation, alternative sources include hydro, wind, solar, waste coal, landfill methane and fuel cells. an electric distribution company will pay an alternative compliance payment of $45 for each mwh that it is short of its required alternative energy supply percentage. since ppl electric's plr generation rates are capped through 2009 as described above and the legislation allows for a cost recovery exemption period, ppl electric will not be subject to the requirements of this legislation until 2010. in that year, ppl electric will have to supply about 9% of the total amount of electricity it delivers to its plr customers from alternative energy sources. ppl electric is purchasing all of the supply required to meet its 2010 default service obligations pursuant to a puc approved competitive bridge plan (the plan). under the plan, ppl electric is obtaining full requirements service which includes the generation or credits that ppl electric will need to comply with the aeps act in 2010. at this time, ppl electric cannot predict the impact of this legislation on its future results of operations because the impact will depend on a number of factors that will not be known until 2010, including customer load requirements, plr contract terms and available alternative energy sources in the market. the general assembly passed and the governor signed into law act 129 in october 2008. the law creates an energy efficiency and conservation program and smart metering technology requirements, adopts new plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and makes changes to the existing alternative energy portfolio standard. see "regulatory issues - pennsylvania activities" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129, other legislative and regulatory impacts and ppl electric's efforts to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2009. ppl gas utilities until its sale in october 2008, ppl gas utilities operated a natural gas distribution and propane business which provided natural gas and propane services to approximately 110,000 customers in various counties throughout pennsylvania, as well as in a small area of maryland and delaware. see note 10 to the financial statements for information on the sale of ppl gas utilities. international delivery segment - includes wpd, a regulated electricity distribution company in the u.k. wpd, through indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, operates two of the 15 distribution networks providing electricity service in the u.k. the wpd subsidiaries together serve approximately 2.6 million end-users in the u.k. wpd (south west) serves 1.5 million customers in a 5,560 square mile area of southwest england. wpd (south wales) serves an area of wales opposite the bristol channel from wpd (south west)'s territory. its 1.1 million customers occupy 4,550 square miles of wales. wpd is headquartered in bristol, england. see "franchise and licenses" for additional information about wpd's regulator, ofgem, which sets price controls and grants distribution licenses. ppl global had controlling interests in electric transmission and distribution companies serving customers in chile, el salvador and bolivia until their respective sales in 2007. see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information on these sales. seasonality demand for and market prices of electricity are affected by weather. as a result, ppl's overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the nature and location of the facilities ppl owns and the terms of the contracts to purchase or sell electricity. financial condition see ppl's, ppl energy supply's and ppl electric's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for this information. capital expenditure requirements see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources" in ppl's, ppl energy supply's and ppl electric's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information concerning estimated capital expenditure requirements for the years 2009-2013. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information concerning expected capital expenditures for environmental matters. competition the unregulated businesses and markets in which ppl and its subsidiaries participate are highly competitive. since the early 1990s, there has been increased competition in u.s. energy markets because of federal and state deregulation initiatives. for instance, in 1992 the energy act amended the federal power act to provide open access to electric transmission systems for wholesale transactions. in 1996, the customer choice act was enacted in pennsylvania to restructure the state's electric utility industry to create a competitive market for electricity generation. certain other states in which ppl's subsidiaries operate have also adopted "customer choice" plans to allow customers to choose their electricity supplier. ppl and its subsidiaries believe that competition in deregulated energy markets will continue to be intense. see "item 1a. risk factors" for more information concerning the risks ppl faces with respect to competition in the deregulated energy markets. pursuant to ppl electric's authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to residential customers. see "franchises and licenses" for more information. power supply ppl energy supply's owned or controlled system capacity (winter rating) at december 31, 2008 was 12,002 mw. the capacity of generating units is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changed circumstances. see "item 2. properties" for a description of ppl energy supply's plants at december 31, 2008. during 2008, ppl generation's plants generated the following amounts of electricity. state millions of kwh pennsylvania 44,189 montana 8,179 maine 368 illinois 164 new york 149 connecticut 132 total 53,181 of this generation, 52% of the energy was from coal-fired stations, 32% from nuclear operations at the susquehanna station, 8% from hydroelectric stations and 8% from oil/gas-fired stations. ppl energy supply estimates that, on average, approximately 95% of its expected annual generation output for 2009 will be used to meet: ppl energyplus's obligation under two contracts to provide electricity for ppl electric to satisfy its plr obligation under the customer choice act through 2009; ppl energyplus's obligation under contracts to provide electricity to northwestern; and contractual sales to other counterparties for terms of various lengths. ppl energy supply is continuing to enter into new power sales contracts to obtain firm commitments for a portion of the output of its generating facilities in advance of the expiration of the plr contracts at the end of 2009. ppl energy supply has already entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for the years 2010 and beyond. based on developments in the wholesale markets over the last several years, ppl energy supply expects that new baseload output contracts are likely to continue to be of a shorter duration than the plr contracts which, at inception, had terms of approximately nine years. these contractual arrangements are consistent with, and are integral to, ppl energy supply's supply business strategy to capture profits while managing exposure to adverse movements in energy and fuel prices and counterparty credit risk. this strategy includes matching ppl energy supply's anticipated energy supply (including generation as well as purchase commitments) with load, or customer demand, under contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy counterparties. see note 15 to the financial statements for more information regarding ppl energy supply's wholesale energy commitments and note 16 for more information regarding the plr contracts. a subsidiary of ppl energy supply funds, develops, constructs, owns and operates plants that produce renewable energy. ppl energyplus markets the energy produced by these plants and renewable energy credits to commercial, industrial and institutional customers. another subsidiary of ppl energy supply has existing renewable energy projects throughout pennsylvania, new york, new jersey and connecticut, with capacity of 32 mw. during 2008, these projects generated 62 million kwh. ppl energyplus purchases the output from two wind farms in pennsylvania with a combined capacity of 50 mw. fuel supply coal pennsylvania ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, actively manages ppl's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in central and northern appalachia. during 2008, ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, purchased about 95% of the coal delivered to ppl generation's wholly-owned pennsylvania stations under short-term and long-term contracts and obtained 5% through spot market purchases. these contracts provided ppl generation 6.9 million tons of coal. contracts currently in place are expected to provide 7.5 million tons in 2009. at december 31, 2008, the wholly-owned pennsylvania plants had sufficient supply for approximately 39 days of operations. the amount of coal in inventory varies from time to time depending on market conditions and plant operations. in 2006, ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, entered into a long-term coal purchase agreement with consol energy inc. the contract will provide more than one-third of ppl generation's projected annual coal needs for the pennsylvania power plants from 2010 through 2018. ppl generation has other contracts that, in total, will provide additional coal supply for ppl's projected annual needs from 2009 through 2012. also at december 31, 2008, a ppl generation subsidiary owned a 12.34% interest in the keystone station and a 16.25% interest in the conemaugh station. the keystone station contracts with keystone fuels, llc for its coal requirements. in 2008, keystone fuels, llc provided 5.3 million tons of coal to the keystone station. the conemaugh station requirements are purchased under contract from conemaugh fuels, llc. in 2008, conemaugh fuels, llc provided 4.7 million tons of coal to the conemaugh station. initial deliveries of limestone in preparation for startup of the scrubbers that were being installed at the montour power plant began in october 2007. the montour scrubber project was completed in may 2008. contracts are in place for all the limestone requirements for the three remaining planned scrubbers at ppl generation's wholly-owned pennsylvania stations through 2010. when all four scrubbers are fully operational, it is projected that annual limestone requirements will be approximately 700,000 tons. during 2008, approximately 350,000 tons of limestone was delivered to ppl generation's wholly-owned pennsylvania stations under long-term contracts. montana ppl montana has a 50% leasehold interest in colstrip units 1 and 2, and a 30% leasehold interest in colstrip unit 3. ppl montana, along with the other owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined quality characteristics and specifications. the current coal supply contract for units 1 and 2 is in effect through december 31, 2009. in 2007, ppl montana entered into a new long-term purchase and supply agreement with the current supplier for units 1 and 2 that will begin january 1, 2010. the new contract will provide these units with 100% of the coal requirements through december 31, 2014, and at least 85% of such requirements from january 1, 2015 through december 31, 2019. the coal supply contract for unit 3 is in effect through december 31, 2019, and will provide 100% of the coal requirements of this unit. coal supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality characteristics and specifications for ppl montana's corette station. the contracts supplied 100% of the plant coal requirements in 2008. similar contracts are currently in place to supply 100% of the expected coal requirements through 2010. oil and natural gas ppl generation's martins creek units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas. ppl energyplus is responsible for procuring the oil and natural gas supply for all ppl generation operations. during 2008, 100% of the physical oil and gas requirements for the martins creek units were purchased on the spot market. at december 31, 2008, ppl energyplus had no long-term agreements for these oil requirements. at december 31, 2008, there were no long-term delivery or supply agreements to purchase natural gas for the university park facility in illinois. ppl energyplus has a long-term contract for approximately 40% of the expected pipeline transportation requirements of the wallingford facility in connecticut, but has no long-term physical supply agreement to purchase natural gas. ppl energyplus has a short-term and long-term gas transportation contract in place for approximately 30% of the maximum daily requirements of the lower mt. bethel facility in pennsylvania, but has no long-term physical supply agreement to purchase natural gas. in june 2008, ppl energyplus executed an agreement to acquire the rights to an existing long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of the ironwood facility. ppl energyplus has a short-term transportation contract in place for approximately 10% of the maximum daily requirements of the ironwood facility for natural gas and has signed "precedent agreements" for long-term transportation contracts to serve approximately 25% of ironwood's maximum daily requirements. ppl energyplus currently has no long-term physical supply agreements to purchase natural gas for ironwood. nuclear the nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. ppl susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services. these contracts are expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of 2016 and unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2015. ppl susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued operation of the nuclear units. federal law requires the u.s. government to provide for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel. under the nuclear waste policy act (nwpa), the doe carried out an analysis of a site in nevada for a permanent nuclear waste repository. there is no definitive date by which this repository will be operational. as a result, it was necessary to expand susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity. to support this expansion, ppl susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage technology. the facility is modular, so that additional storage capacity can be added as needed. the facility began receiving spent nuclear fuel in 1999. ppl susquehanna estimates that there is sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approximately 2017, under current operating conditions. if necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be discharged through the current licensed life of the plant. in 2002, the president approved the congressional override of a veto by the state of nevada, designating yucca mountain, nevada, as the site for development of a permanent repository for high-level radioactive waste. in june 2008, the doe submitted a license application to the nrc, which the nrc docketed in september 2008. the nrc staff review of the application is in progress. petitions for an nrc hearing on the application were filed in december 2008. in 1996, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled that the nwpa imposed on the doe an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel on or before january 31, 1998. in 1997, the court ruled that the contracts between the utilities and the doe provide a potentially adequate remedy if the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by january 31, 1998. the doe did not, in fact, begin to accept spent nuclear fuel by that date. the doe continues to contest claims that its breach of contract resulted in recoverable damages. in january 2004, ppl susquehanna filed suit in the u.s. court of federal claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the doe's breach of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel. ppl cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. provider of last resort supply the customer choice act requires electricity delivery companies, like ppl electric, to act as a plr of electricity and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations to be established by the puc. in may 2007, the puc approved ppl electric's plan to procure default electricity supply in 2010 -- after its current supply agreements with ppl energyplus expire -- for retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier. pursuant to this plan, ppl electric has completed four of six competitive supply solicitations and has contracted for two-thirds of the 2010 electricity supply it expects to need for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. see "regulatory issues - pennsylvania activities" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding ppl electric's efforts to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2010. environmental matters certain ppl subsidiaries, including ppl electric and ppl generation subsidiaries, are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. see ppl's and ppl energy supply's "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources" in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information concerning environmental expenditures during 2008 and estimated expenditures during 2009-2013. certain environmental laws, regulations and developments that may have a substantial impact on ppl are discussed below. see "environmental matters" in note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding these laws and regulations and the status of ppl's and its subsidiaries compliance and remediation activities, as well as legal and regulatory proceedings involving ppl and its subsidiaries. air the clean air act includes, among other things, provisions that: (a) restrict the construction of, and revise the performance standards for, new and substantially modified coal-fired and oil-fired generating stations; and (b) authorize the epa to impose substantial per day noncompliance penalties for each facility found to be in violation of the requirements of an applicable state implementation plan. state agencies administer the epa's air quality regulations through state implementation plans and have concurrent authority to impose penalties for noncompliance. in 2005, the epa finalized its cair requiring substantial reductions for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions in 28 midwestern and eastern states, including pennsylvania. in july 2008, the united states court of appeals for the d.c. circuit (the u.s. circuit court) invalidated cair. in december 2008, the u.s. circuit court remanded cair back to the epa without vacating the rule. as a result, cair was reinstated and there is once again a reduction requirement. pursuant to a separate rule finalized in 2005, the epa also required mercury reductions nationwide. however, a federal appeals court has negated the epa mercury rule. the epa is now developing a mercury mact standard. based on the federal appeals court action and restrictions on dep's authority under pennsylvania law, ppl challenged pennsylvania's mercury regulations. in january 2009, the pennsylvania commonwealth court (commonwealth court) issued its ruling concluding that the pennsylvania mercury rule was unlawful, invalid and unenforceable. the pennsylvania dep has appealed this decision to the pennsylvania supreme court and the commonwealth court decision has been automatically stayed. ppl has filed an application to lift the stay. ppl is evaluating its mercury control plans and what steps it needs to take at this time. global climate change there is concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas emissions including, most significantly, carbon dioxide. this concern has led to increased federal legislative proposals, actions at regional, state or local levels, as well as litigation relating to greenhouse gas emissions, including an april 2007 u.s. supreme court decision holding that the epa has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under the clean air act. in addition, the obama administration has reaffirmed its support for mandatory regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including a cap-and-trade system. president obama's appointee for administrator of the epa has indicated that the epa is moving forward with regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the cair, though the exact form of such regulation remains unclear. the epa has also agreed, following this decision, to a remand of new source performance standards (nsps) applicable to stationary sources to reconsider its approach to including greenhouse gases under such rules. if the epa concludes greenhouse gases from motor vehicles pose an endangerment to public health or welfare, this could lead to regulation of stationary source carbon dioxide emissions. the epa might also proceed to regulate greenhouse gases from stationary sources directly under the nsps or under the provisions of the clean air act requiring best available control technology to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in areas currently in attainment of ambient air quality standards. also, increased pressure for carbon dioxide emissions reduction is being initiated by investor and environmental organizations and the international community. in addition, a nuisance claim brought by a number of states against other large electric generating companies was dismissed by a federal district court in new york, but remains pending on appeal in the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit. ppl believes that the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may have a material impact on its capital expenditures and operations, but the costs are not now determinable. ppl also cannot predict the impact that any pending or future federal or state legislation regarding more stringent environmental standards could have on ppl or its subsidiaries. water to implement the requirements of the federal water pollution control act of 1972, as amended by the clean water act of 1977 and the water quality act of 1987, the epa has adopted regulations on effluent standards for steam electric stations. the states administer the epa's effluent standards through state laws and regulations relating to, among other things, effluent discharges and water quality. the standards adopted by the epa pursuant to the clean water act may have a significant impact on existing facilities of certain ppl subsidiaries, depending on the states' interpretation and future amendments to regulations. the epa released its 2008 effluent guidelines plan and has chosen not to revise the steam electric effluent guidelines. instead, the epa plans to continue to study the industry's wastewater discharges, with a focus on coal-fired plants and "particular interest" in flue gas desulfurization wastewater treatment, ash sluice water management and water reuse opportunities. the epa plans to continue to study the industry through 2009 and 2010 annual reviews, including sampling at selected plants. the epa finalized requirements in 2004 for new or modified cooling water intake structures. these requirements affect where generating facilities are built, establish intake design standards, and could lead to requirements for cooling towers at new and modified power plants. another rule finalized in 2004 that addressed existing structures has been withdrawn following a january 2007 decision by the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit. in april 2008, the u.s. supreme court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari filed by utility water act group, public service enterprise group, inc. and entergy corporation, limited to one issue. the issue is whether section 316(b) of the clean water act authorizes the epa to compare costs with benefits in determining the "best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact" at cooling water intake structures. the supreme court heard oral arguments in december 2008. depending on the outcome of the u.s. supreme court review and what changes the epa makes to the rule in accordance with this decision and the other issues raised by the second circuit court (that will not be reviewed by the u.s. supreme court), in addition to what actions the states may take on their own, these actions could result in stricter standards for existing structures that could impose significant costs on ppl subsidiaries. pursuant to the surface mining and reclamation act of 1977, the osm has adopted effluent guidelines which are applicable to ppl subsidiaries as a result of their past coal mining and processing activities. the epa and the osm limitations, guidelines and standards also are enforced through the issuance of npdes permits. in accordance with the provisions of the clean water act and the reclamation act of 1977, the epa and the osm have authorized the states to implement the npdes program. compliance with applicable water quality standards is assured by state imposition of npdes permit conditions and requirements to address acid mine drainage. solid and hazardous waste the provisions of superfund authorize the epa to require past and present owners of contaminated sites and generators of any hazardous substance found at a site to clean-up the site or pay the epa or the state for the costs of cleanup. the generators and past owners can be liable even if the generator contributed only a minute portion of the hazardous substances at the site. present owners can be liable even if they contributed no hazardous substances to the site. state laws such as the pennsylvania and montana superfund statutes and the pennsylvania solid waste management act also give state agencies broad authority to identify contaminated sites or sites with waste that has been improperly disposed of, and to order owners or responsible parties to clean-up the sites. if responsible parties cannot or will not perform the clean-up, the agency can hire contractors to clean-up the sites and then require reimbursement from the responsible parties after the clean-up is completed. another pennsylvania statute, the land recycling and environmental remediation standards, encourages voluntary clean-ups by allowing responsible parties to choose from a menu of clean-up standards and providing liability protection commensurate with the clean-up standard chosen. furthermore, the epa and several states, including montana, are considering establishing regulations under the resource conservation and recovery act that could impact the disposal and management of coal combustion products (ccps), which include ash and scrubber wastes and other by-products. the large ash release at a tennessee valley authority site in tennessee in december 2008 and subsequent widespread media coverage has significantly increased the likelihood of new federal regulatory requirements for ccps. ppl cannot predict at this time what impact, if any, such regulations would have on its operating facilities. certain federal and state statutes, including federal and state superfund statutes, also impose liability on the responsible parties for the lost value of damaged natural resources. low-level radioactive waste under federal law, each state is responsible for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated in that state. states may join in regional compacts to jointly fulfill their responsibilities. the states of pennsylvania, maryland, delaware and west virginia are members of the appalachian states low-level radioactive waste compact. efforts to develop a regional disposal facility in pennsylvania were suspended by the pennsylvania dep in 1998. the commonwealth retains the legal authority and may be required to resume the siting process should it be necessary. in 2008, low-level radioactive waste from the susquehanna facility was sent to independently operated facilities in barnwell, south carolina, and clive, utah for disposal. the barnwell facility stopped receiving waste from most states, including pennsylvania, in june 2008. ppl will send most of its low-level radioactive waste to the clive, utah facility and the remainder will be stored at the susquehanna storage facility. in the event the clive site closes or other emergent disposal options become unavailable or are no longer cost-effective, low-level radioactive waste will be stored on-site at susquehanna, in a facility licensed for that purpose by the nrc. ppl susquehanna cannot predict the future availability of independently operated low-level waste disposal facilities or the cost of disposal at such facilities. ppl believes that its licensed storage facility located at susquehanna is sufficient for the foreseeable future to replace the portion of disposal capability at the barnwell facility that will not be shifted to the clive site. electric and magnetic fields concerns have been expressed by some members of the public regarding potential health effects of power frequency emfs, which are emitted by all devices carrying electricity, including electric transmission and distribution lines and substation equipment. government officials in the u.s. and the u.k. have reviewed this issue. the u.s. national institute of environmental health sciences concluded in 2002 that, for most health outcomes, there is no evidence that emfs cause adverse effects. the agency further noted that there is some epidemiological evidence of an association with childhood leukemia, but that the evidence is difficult to interpret without supporting laboratory evidence. the u.k. national radiological protection board (part of the u.k. health protection agency) concluded in 2004 that, while the research on emfs does not provide a basis to find that emfs cause any illness, there is a basis to consider precautionary measures beyond existing exposure guidelines. in april 2007, the stakeholder group on extremely low frequency emf, set up by the u.k. government, issued its interim assessment, which describes a number of options for reducing public exposure to emfs. this assessment is being considered by the u.k. government. ppl and its subsidiaries believe the current efforts to determine whether emfs cause adverse health effects should continue and are taking steps to reduce emfs, where practical, in the design of new transmission and distribution facilities. ppl and its subsidiaries are unable to predict what effect, if any, the emf issue might have on their operations and facilities either in the u.s. or the u.k., and the associated cost, or what, if any, liabilities they might incur related to the emf issue. general ppl and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities and operations. in complying with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including the areas of water and air quality, hazardous and solid waste handling and disposal and toxic substances, ppl's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain of their facilities. ppl's subsidiaries may also incur significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but could be significant. franchises and licenses ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies to which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. see "background - supply segment" for a discussion of ppl energyplus's licenses in various states. ppl energyplus also has an export license from the doe to sell capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in canada. ppl susquehanna operates units 1 and 2 pursuant to nrc operating licenses. in september 2006, ppl susquehanna applied to the nrc for 20-year license renewals for each of the susquehanna units to extend their expiration dates, from 2022 to 2042 for unit 1 and from 2024 to 2044 for unit 2. ppl cannot predict whether or when nrc approval will be obtained. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information. in january 2008, ppl susquehanna received nrc approval for its request to increase the generation capacity of the susquehanna nuclear plant. the total expected capacity increase is 159 mw, of which ppl susquehanna's share would be 143 mw. the first uprate for unit 1, totaling 50 mw, was completed in may 2008. the remaining total expected capacity increase is 109 mw, of which ppl susquehanna's share would be 98 mw. ppl susquehanna's share of the expected capital cost for this project is $345 million and ppl expects to achieve the full capacity increase of 159 mw after the refueling outage in 2010 for unit 1. in october 2008, ppl susquehanna submitted a cola to the nrc for a new nuclear generating unit (bell bend) to be built adjacent to the susquehanna plant. the cola was accepted for review by the nrc in december 2008. see note 9 to financial statements for additional information. ppl holtwood operates the holtwood hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license renewed by the ferc in 1980 and expiring in 2014. ppl holtwood operates the wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license renewed by the ferc in 2005 and expiring in 2044. ppl holtwood also owns one-third of the capital stock of safe harbor water power corporation (safe harbor), which holds a project license that extends the operation of its hydroelectric generating station until 2030. the total capacity of the safe harbor generating station is 425 mw, and ppl holtwood is entitled by contract to one-third of the total capacity. in december 2007, ppl asked the ferc for approval to expand its holtwood plant by 125 mw. in december 2008, ppl announced that it had withdrawn the application in light of current economic conditions, including the high cost of capital, and projections of future energy prices. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information. the 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir purchased from montana power in 1999 are licensed by the ferc. these licenses expire periodically, and the generating facilities must be relicensed at such times. the current ferc license for the mystic facility expires in 2009 but has been extended, effective january 1, 2010, for an additional 40-year term. the thompson falls and kerr licenses expire in 2025 and 2035, respectively; and the licenses for the nine missouri-madison facilities expire in 2040. in connection with the relicensing of these generation facilities, the ferc may, under applicable law, relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee, or the u.s. government may take over the facility. if the original licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing. wpd is authorized by the u.k. government to provide electric distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. for instance, wpd is subject to governmental regulation of the prices it can charge and the quality of service it must provide, and wpd can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service. wpd operates under distribution licenses granted, and price controls set, by ofgem. the price control formula that governs wpd's allowed revenue is normally determined every five years with the next review to be completed by the end of 2009, effective april 1, 2010. earnings in 2010 and beyond may be affected by this rate review. wpd cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the rate review. employee relations as of december 31, 2008, ppl and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees. ppl energy supply ppl generation 2,669 ppl energyplus 2,006 (a) ppl global (primarily wpd) 2,275 total ppl energy supply 6,950 ppl electric 2,222 ppl services &amp; other 1,382 total ppl 10,554 (a) includes union employees of mechanical contracting subsidiaries, whose numbers tend to fluctuate due to the nature of this business. approximately 5,000, or 60%, of ppl's domestic workforce are members of labor unions, with four ibew locals representing approximately 3,600 employees. the other unions primarily represent employees of the mechanical contractors. the bargaining agreement with the largest ibew local was negotiated in may 2006 and expires in 2010. this agreement covers approximately 3,250 employees. the ibew representing approximately 250 employees at the montana colstrip power plants are covered under a four-year labor agreement expiring in april 2012. in january 2008, a four-year contract was renegotiated with the ibew local of montana that represents approximately 80 employees at the hydroelectric facilities and at the corette plant that expires in april 2012. approximately 1,870, or 82%, of ppl's u.k. workforce are members of labor unions. wpd recognizes five unions, the largest of which represents 37% of its union workforce. wpd's electricity business agreement covers approximately 1,820 employees; it may be amended by agreement between wpd and the unions and is terminable with 12 months notice by either side. see note 26 to the financial statements for a cost reduction initiative announced in february 2009, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 200 management and staff positions at ppl. available information ppl's internet web site is www.pplweb.com. on the investor center page of that web site, ppl provides access to all sec filings of ppl registrants free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec. additionally, ppl registrants' filings are available at the sec's web site (www.sec.gov) and at the sec's public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, dc 20549, or by calling 1-800-sec-0330. item 1a. risk factors ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric face various risks associated with our businesses. while we have identified below the risks we currently consider material, these risks are not the only risks that we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. in addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 15 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. as used in this item 1a., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to ppl energy supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the supply and international delivery segment discussions, or ppl electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania delivery segment discussion. risks related to supply segment ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) we are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale electricity markets. we purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based tariffs authorized by the ferc throughout the u.s. and also enter into short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price fluctuations. if we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay damages. these damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of any undelivered capacity or electricity. depending on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be significant. extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, environmental compliance costs, transmission disruptions, and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and electricity. in addition, our power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post collateral for the benefit of the counterparties if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices by certain thresholds. at december 31, 2008, we posted $303 million of collateral, in the form of letters of credit, under these contracts. since 2006, we have increased our available liquidity facilities to $4.2 billion, to provide for these collateral obligations and to maintain our credit ratings. these increases were needed, in significant part, to meet potential collateral requirements under these contracts and to support contracts that we expect to enter into as we seek to grow our wholesale energy business. although we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity facilities to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these contracts, we expect to continue to need to increase our credit facilities to support our hedging program and collateral requirements and for other purposes, and there is no certainty that such additional credit will be available when needed due to the continued financial downturn or other factors. we also face credit risk that parties with whom we contract will default in their performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the time of contract. whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these risks by various means, including agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract price beyond certain thresholds. however, there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance, which could adversely impact our ability to fully meet our obligations to other parties, which could in turn subject us to claims for damages. adverse changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. our energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power exceed our costs to supply power, are impacted by changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, renewable energy credits, electricity transmission and related congestion charges and other costs. unlike most commodities, the limited ability to store electric power requires that it must be consumed at the time of production. as a result, wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable. among the factors that can influence such prices are: demand for electricity and supplies of electricity available from current or new generation resources; variable production costs, primarily fuel (and the associated fuel transportation costs) and emission allowance expense for the generation resources used to meet the demand for electricity; transmission capacity and service into, or out of, markets served; changes in the regulatory framework for wholesale power markets; liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, as well as general credit worthiness of key participants in the market; and weather conditions impacting demand for electricity or the facilities necessary to deliver electricity. see exhibit 99(a) for more information concerning the market fluctuations in wholesale energy, fuel and emission allowance prices over the past five years. the volatility of these business factors has increased significantly with the current economic downturn. our risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency and counterparties, may not work as planned, and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs. we actively manage the market risk inherent in our energy-related, debt, foreign currency and counterparty credit positions. we have implemented procedures to monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs, including validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics. nonetheless, our risk management programs may not work as planned. for instance, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management positions. similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not designed to address. the volatility of these business factors has increased significantly with the current economic downturn. as a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events result in greater losses or costs than our risk models predict or greater volatility in our earnings and financial position. in addition, our trading, marketing and risk management activities are exposed to counterparty credit risk and market liquidity risk. we have adopted a credit risk management policy and program to evaluate counterparty credit risk. however, if counterparties fail to perform, which is more likely given the continued economic downturn, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices. in that event, our financial results are likely to be adversely affected. our market liquidity risk is discussed further below. we do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price volatility. we attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity sales arrangements by either reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and services through competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts. we also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to weather conditions, fuel requirements and other electricity-related commodities. however, based on economic and other considerations, we may not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. the risks associated with our unhedged positions have increased significantly with the current economic and financial market downturn. we face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. unlike our regulated delivery businesses, our energy supply business is not assured of any rate of return on our capital investments through a predetermined rate structure, and our revenues and results of operations are dependent on our ability to operate in a competitive environment. an important focus of our supply business over the next several years will be the prudent execution of our marketing strategy based on then prevailing market conditions, but we may not be successful because of the intense competition that we face in the deregulated electricity markets. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of regulatory authorities and other factors. these competitive factors may negatively impact our ability to sell electricity and related products and services, as well as the prices that we may charge for such products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow our business. following the expiration of our existing power sales agreements, we currently expect to sell our available energy and capacity into the competitive wholesale markets through contracts of various durations. competition in the wholesale power markets will occur principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and availability. we expect that the commencement of commercial operation of new electric facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity will continue to increase the competitiveness of the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have a material adverse effect on the prices we receive for electricity. we also face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary services. we primarily compete with other electricity suppliers based on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. we also compete against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to credit sources, and our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. competitors in the wholesale power markets in which ppl generation subsidiaries and ppl energyplus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators and unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities. in the past, puhca significantly restricted mergers and acquisitions and other investments in the electric utility sector. entirely new competitors, including financial institutions, have entered the energy markets as a result of the repeal of puhca. the repeal of puhca also may lead to consolidation in our industry, resulting in competitors with significantly greater financial resources than we have. disruptions in our fuel supplies could occur, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our generation facilities. we purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. disruption in the delivery of fuel and other products consumed during the production of electricity (including lime, limestone, other chemicals), including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. despite federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or prevent or delay operation of our facilities. our u.s. generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market. generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the ferc. the ferc has authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices. the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not workably competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates. any reduction by the ferc in the rates we may receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations. see "ferc market-based rate authority" in note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the ferc's market-based rate authority program, and "pjm rpm litigation" in note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding ferc proceedings that could impact pjm's capacity pricing model. in addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals. if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to additional costs. our generation facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our financial performance. our ability to manage operational risk with respect to our generation plants is critical to our financial performance. operation of our power plants at expected capacity levels involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, labor disputes and fuel interruption. in addition, weather and natural disasters can disrupt our generation plants. weather conditions also have a direct impact on the river flows required to operate our hydroelectric plants at expected capacity levels. depending on the timing and duration of both planned and unplanned complete or partial outages at our power plants (in particular, if such outages are during peak periods or during periods of, or caused by, severe weather), our revenues from energy sales could significantly decrease and our expenses significantly increase, and we could be required to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our energy sales commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. many of our generating units are reaching mid-life, and we are faced with the potential for more frequent unplanned outages and the possibility of planned outages of longer duration to accommodate significant investments in major component replacements at these facilities. we will selectively continue to pursue growth of generation capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. although our generation expansion program has been substantially scaled back due to the current economic conditions, on a selective basis, we will continue to pursue expansion of our generation capacity over the next several years through power uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the potential construction of new power plants and the potential acquisition of existing plants. because of the current adverse conditions in the u.s. economy and financial markets, any undertaking to expand our generating capability will be rigorously scrutinized on an ongoing basis and will be subject to change. nevertheless, the acquisition, development and construction of additional generation capacity involves numerous risks. any planned power uprates could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs. with respect to the construction of new plants or the acquisition of existing plants, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses in preparation for competitive bids that we may not win or before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. the success of both a new project and a newly-acquired plant would likely be contingent upon, among other things, the negotiation of satisfactory fuel supply and power sales contracts, as well as acceptable financing conditions. our success in developing a new plant or expanding existing generation capacity would likely be contingent upon, among other things, negotiating satisfactory engineering and construction contracts, receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals and satisfactory completion of construction. if we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a facility, we would generally be unable to recover our investment in the project. furthermore, we might be unable to run any new or acquired plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings. for example, as discussed in more detail in note 9 to the financial statements, in october 2008, we filed a cola with the nrc to construct a new nuclear unit which is technology specific. we have made substantial cola expenditures, but we have not yet committed to construction of this new nuclear unit as such construction is subject to numerous uncertainties. in addition to the general uncertainties discussed above for our generation expansion plans, these uncertainties include nrc and other governmental approvals, potential public opposition, continuing nrc review of the evolutionary power reactor technology involved, the cost and availability of acceptable financing, including under the doe's loan guarantee and other governmental programs, acceptable arrangements with project partners and vendors, rating agency concerns, schedule delays, legislative and regulatory changes, competitive market structure and the prospect for cost recovery, among other factors. changes in technology may negatively impact the value of our power plants. a basic premise of our business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low price. there are alternate technologies to produce electricity, most notably fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells. research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in alternate technologies. it is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternate methods of electricity production to a level that is equal to or below that of most central station production. also, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators. in addition, the new presidential administration and the new u.s. congress have voiced strong support for such alternative energy sources. as a result of these factors, the value of our generation facilities could be significantly reduced. on february 17, 2009, president obama signed into law the $787 billion american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 (the "2009 stimulus act") to provide incentives and financial support to the u.s. economy. among other things, the 2009 stimulus act specifically provides a total of $58 billion to be available for energy-related initiatives, primarily $20 billion in renewable energy tax credits to encourage development of wind, solar and other renewable energy sources, and $32 billion for development of a "smart grid" in the u.s. (the term smart grid, generally, means computer-based and other enhancements to the electricity distribution and transmission system that will both (i) make consumption of electricity more efficient, thereby requiring lower generation and achieving corresponding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and (ii) better enable alternative sources of generated electricity, like that from solar and wind sources, to be introduced into the national and regional electricity grids in the u.s). it is uncertain at this time to what extent these initiatives may impact our businesses, except that little impact is expected in the short term. the 2009 stimulus act does not address issues related to nuclear generation or what action, if any, may be taken to increase the $18.5 billion in federal loans or guarantees to support construction of new nuclear facilities that was contained in the energy policy act of 2005. in addition, it does not appear that the 2009 stimulus act is intended to provide incentives for the development of "clean coal" technology. obama administration designees have stated that the administration favors "cap-and-trade" programs to control carbon emissions, but it is uncertain at the present time what effects such programs are likely to have on our businesses. marketing energy for the period after expiration of the plr contracts poses other risks to the supply segment. the existing full requirements plr contracts between ppl energyplus and ppl electric expire at the end of 2009. in connection with ppl electric's puc-approved procurement plan for default electricity supply in 2010 for retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier, ppl energyplus was one of the successful bidders in the first competitive solicitation process and in july 2007, entered into an agreement with ppl electric to supply up to 671 mw of total peak load in 2010, at an average price of $91.42 per mwh. at this time, we cannot predict the extent to which ppl energyplus will sell additional power to ppl electric after 2009. in anticipation of the expiration of the plr contracts at the end of 2009, our energy marketing and trading operation continues to enter into other new supply contracts for the post-2009 period, including bilateral and load-following contracts with new counterparties at market prices. the electricity supply obligations under these new contracts will be met by generation we own and electricity and other energy-related products purchased from other parties. in connection with these activities, we hedge the future energy production capability of our generation facilities and the related fuel costs by buying and selling energy, capacity, fuel, transmission and other products in the wholesale energy markets and entering into various forms of financial and physical contracts to capture additional energy margins and generally manage risk. these activities may cause volatility in future cash flows and results of operations. whether we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into or renew long-term power sale, fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements to mitigate market price and supply risk may affect our earnings. as a result of the plr contracts and certain other agreements, a substantial portion of our anticipated generation production and capacity value is currently committed through 2009 under power sales agreements of various terms that include fixed prices for electric power. in addition, we are actively pursuing other load-following or full requirements contracts with other parties in energy market auctions and elsewhere. in connection with such agreements, we have entered into longer-term fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements that include fixed prices for a significant portion of our forecasted needs. whether we decide to, or are able to continue to enter into such agreements or renew existing agreements, the market conditions at that time, will affect our financial performance. for instance, in the absence of long-term power sales agreements, we would sell the energy, capacity and other products from our facilities in the competitive wholesale power markets under contracts of shorter duration at then-current market prices. although the current forward prices for electricity are less than the prices available under some of our existing power sales agreements, this situation may not continue. in addition, if we do not secure or maintain favorable fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements for our power generation facilities, our fuel costs (and associated fuel transportation costs) could exceed the revenues we derive from our energy sales. given the volatility and potential for material differences between actual electricity prices and fuel and other costs, if we do not secure or maintain long-term electricity sales and fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements, our margins will be subject to increased volatility and, depending on future electricity and fuel costs (and associated fuel transportation costs), our financial results may be materially adversely affected. the plr contracts do not provide for a specific level of supply and demand and actual activity significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy margins. ppl electric is obligated to provide electricity supply to its plr customers at predetermined capped rates through 2009 and has entered into puc-approved, full requirements energy supply agreements with ppl energyplus at the rates ppl electric is entitled to charge its plr customers to fulfill its plr obligation. if ppl electric's customers obtain electricity from alternate suppliers, which they are entitled to do at any time, ppl energyplus's sales of electricity under the plr contracts could decrease. alternatively, demand that we satisfy pursuant to the plr contracts could increase as a result of severe weather conditions, economic developments or other reasons over which we have no control. we satisfy our electricity supply obligations through a portfolio approach of providing electricity from our generation assets, contractual relationships and market purchases. at december 31, 2008, the plr requirements required about 86% of the normal operating capacity of our existing pennsylvania generation assets. a significant increase in demand would adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of the plr contracts to provide the energy necessary to fulfill increased demand at the capped rates, which we expect to remain below the wholesale prices at which we would have to purchase additional supply if needed or, if we had available capacity, the prices at which we could otherwise sell the additional supply. accordingly, any significant increase in demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. we have other load-following or full requirements contracts with other counterparties and are actively pursuing other similar contracts. these contracts present the same general risks surrounding variability of demand as those noted above under the existing plr contracts, which has been partially mitigated through our hedging activities. if market deregulation is reversed, discontinued or delayed, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. some deregulated electricity markets have experienced supply problems and price volatility. in some of these markets, state legislators, government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to delay market restructuring, change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of these markets that have previously been deregulated or permit electricity delivery companies to construct or acquire generating facilities. in certain states, elements and implications of the electricity market restructurings are being investigated by legislators and regulators or are the subject of ongoing litigation. in addition, the isos that oversee the transmission systems in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. these types of price limitations and other mechanisms may reduce profits that our wholesale power marketing and trading business would have realized based on competitive market conditions absent such limitations and mechanisms. although we generally expect electricity markets to continue to be competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our industry may be made, and legislative or other action affecting the electric power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or reversed in states in which we currently, or may in the future, operate. at this time, there are various ongoing regulatory and legislative activities in pennsylvania regarding plr supply after 2009. we cannot predict the final outcome of these regulatory and legislative activities or their ultimate impact on ppl and ppl energy supply, or ppl electric. for additional information on plr issues after 2009, see "conditions affecting ppl electric's plr supply after 2009 are currently uncertain" under the "risks related to pennsylvania delivery segment" discussion. we rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control to deliver our wholesale electricity and natural gas. if transmission is disrupted, or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver power may be hindered. we depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to the wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric generation facilities. if transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by isos, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or we may be unable to sell products on the most favorable terms. the ferc has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that sufficient transmission capacity will not be available to transmit electricity as we desire. we cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether isos in applicable markets will operate the transmission networks, and provide related services, efficiently. our costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital expenditures on pollution control measures that, if delayed, would adversely affect our profitability and liquidity. our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection. to comply with existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control measures we may take, we have spent and expect to spend substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and compliance. in order to comply with existing and recently-enacted federal environmental laws and regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-fired plants, in 2005 ppl began a program to install scrubbers and other pollution control equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate and nitrogen oxides with co-benefits for mercury emissions reduction). the estimated cost to install this equipment is approximately $1.6 billion, of which $1.3 billion has already been spent. the remaining unspent balance is included in the 2009 through 2013 capital budget. the scrubbers at our montour plant are now in service. we are continuing with installation of scrubbers at our brunner island plant. delays in such installation could require us to purchase additional pollution control emission allowances at market prices or decrease the expected value of excess emission allowances that we could sell at market prices as a result of the scheduled installation of this equipment. such a delay also could require us to burn higher-cost, lower-sulfur coal at these facilities. in addition, many states and environmental groups have challenged certain federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict. as a result, it is possible that state and federal regulations will be developed that will impose more stringent restrictions than are currently in effect, which could require us to increase capital expenditures for pollution control equipment significantly. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for our planned capital projects or which are otherwise necessary to our business. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. furthermore, at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary equipment, which could cause us to shut down those units. there also is growing concern nationally and internationally about carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions (including concern about global warming). various legislative proposals are being considered in congress, and several states already have passed legislation capping carbon dioxide emissions. the new presidential administration has stated that it intends to make the control of air emissions, including the global warming issue, a major initiative. this, combined with the changes in the u.s. congress as a result of the last national election, may make the risks identified above more likely to occur. for more information regarding environmental matters, including existing and proposed federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations to which we are subject, see "environmental matters - domestic" in note 15 to the financial statements. we are subject to the risks of nuclear generation, including the risk that our susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to revised security or safety requirements that would increase our capital and operating expenditures, and uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its licensed life. nuclear generation accounted for about 32% of our 2008 generation output. the risks of nuclear generation generally include: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, as well as security-related, safety-related, and employee-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. in the event of noncompliance, the nrc has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. in addition, revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital or operating expenditures at our susquehanna nuclear plant. in addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our susquehanna plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational loss, damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. risks related to international delivery segment ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) our u.k. delivery business is also subject to risks with respect to rate regulation and operational performance. our u.k. delivery business is rate regulated and operates under an incentive-based regulatory framework. in addition, its ability to manage operational risk is critical to its financial performance. accordingly, with the exception of those risks relating to energy supply, this business is subject to the same general risks as those described below under "risks related to pennsylvania delivery segment." our u.k. delivery business exposes us to risks related to u.k. laws, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, political and regulatory conditions and policies of the u.k. government. these risks may reduce the results of operations from our u.k. delivery business. the acquisition, financing, development and operation of projects in the u.k. entail significant financial risks including: changes in foreign laws or regulations relating to foreign operations, including tax laws and regulations; changes in u.s. laws related to foreign operations, including tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies; severe weather and natural disaster impacts on the electric sector and our assets; changes in labor relations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and in converting foreign revenues to u.s. dollars, which can increase our expenses and/or impair our ability to meet such expenses, and difficulty moving funds out of the country in which the funds were earned; and compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws. risks related to pennsylvania delivery segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) regulators may not approve the rates we request. our pennsylvania delivery business is rate-regulated. while such regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs, including energy supply costs for customers, and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the rates that we may charge our delivery customers are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities. our pennsylvania delivery business is subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will require rate increase requests to the regulators. there is no guarantee that the rates authorized by regulators will match our actual costs or provide a particular return on invested capital at any given time. our transmission and distribution facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our financial performance. our ability to manage operational risk with respect to our transmission and distribution systems is critical to the financial performance of our delivery business. our delivery business also faces several risks, including the breakdown or failure of or damage to equipment or processes (especially due to severe weather or natural disasters), accidents and labor disputes and other factors. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. we may be subject to higher transmission costs and other risks as a result of pjm's regional transmission expansion plan (rtep) process. pjm and the ferc have the authority to require upgrades or expansion of the regional transmission grid, which can result in substantial expenditures for transmission owners. as discussed in note 9 to the financial statements, we will make substantial expenditures to construct the susquehanna-roseland transmission line that pjm has determined is necessary for the reliability of the regional transmission grid. although the ferc has granted our request for incentive rate treatment of such facilities we cannot predict the date when these facilities will be in service or whether delays may occur due to public opposition and other factors. delays could result in significant cost increases for these facilities and decreased reliability of the regional transmission grid. as a result, we cannot predict the ultimate financial or operational impact of this project or other rtep projects on ppl electric. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. under the energy policy act, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are now subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the nerc and enforced by the ferc. compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures, and violations of these standards could result in substantial penalties. as discussed in note 15 to the financial statements, as a result of its self-reporting to the rfc of a potential violation of certain reliability standards, ppl electric could be subject to substantial penalties for such violation. ppl electric generally bears the risk, through 2009, that it will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply at the predetermined capped rates it may charge to its plr customers. in order to mitigate the risk that we will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply through 2009 at the predetermined capped rates we may charge our plr customers, we have entered into puc-approved, full requirements energy supply agreements with ppl energyplus at these capped rates. under one of the plr contracts, we are required to make performance assurance deposits to ppl energyplus when the market price of electricity is less than the contract price by more than our contract collateral threshold. conversely, ppl energyplus is required to make performance assurance deposits to us when the market price of electricity is greater than the contract price by more than its contract collateral threshold. over the past few years, market prices for electricity have exceeded the contract price, and we estimated that, at december 31, 2008, the fair value of the plr contract was approximately $917 million. accordingly, at december 31, 2008, ppl energyplus was required to provide us performance assurance of $300 million, the maximum amount required under the contract. if ppl energyplus is unable to satisfy its energy supply obligations to us under the plr contracts, we would be required to obtain energy supply in the wholesale market at then-current market rates to meet our plr obligation. while the customer choice act provides generally for plr costs to be borne by customers, it is not clear whether we would be able to pass on to our customers any costs of this replacement energy supply that exceed the predetermined capped rates. conditions affecting ppl electric's plr supply after 2009 are currently uncertain. uncertainty driven by potential changes in the regulatory treatment of ppl electric's plr obligation after 2009 when its full requirements contracts with ppl energyplus expire presents a risk for the electricity delivery business. the customer choice act requires electricity delivery companies, like ppl electric, to act as a plr of electricity and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations to be established by the puc. in may 2007, the puc approved ppl electric's plan to procure default electricity supply in 2007 through 2009 for retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier in 2010. pursuant to this plan, ppl electric has contracted for two-thirds of the 2010 default electricity supply it expects to need for residential and small commercial and industrial customers. the puc has approved a plan filed by ppl electric under which the company's residential and small commercial and industrial customers, beginning in 2008, could begin to pay in advance to smooth the impact of price increases when generation rate caps expire in 2010. in february 2009, ppl electric asked the puc for permission to offer customers a second option for reducing the potential initial impact of higher electricity prices resulting from expiration of the generation rate caps. if approved by the puc, this option would enable eligible residential and eligible small-business customers to defer payment of any increase greater than 25% in their 2010 electric bills. the 25% will be calculated on an average rate schedule usage basis, and will be based on a comparison of currently estimated 2009 bills to currently estimated 2010 bills. in addition, i n september 2007, puc regulations became effective requiring pennsylvania electric utilities to provide default electricity supply in 2011 and beyond. in 2008, ppl electric filed for puc approval of its 2011 through may 2014 supply procurement plan under these regulations. ppl electric subsequently amended the termination date of the plan to 2013, consistent with provisions of act 129, discussed below. in addition to this regulatory activity, in june 2008, the pennsylvania general assembly (general assembly) passed, and the governor signed, a bill that would create a $650 million fund for clean energy projects, conservation and energy efficiency initiatives and pollution control projects to be funded through revenue bonds and gross receipts tax revenue, which will increase as rate caps expire. in october 2008 the general assembly passed and the governor signed into law act 129. the law creates an energy efficiency and conservation program and smart metering technology requirements, adopts new plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and makes changes to the existing alternative energy portfolio standard. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified dates. utilities not meeting the requirements of act 129 are subject to significant penalties. although we expect to meet these requirements, numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties on us. the pennsylvania governor recently publicly stated that he expects some form of rate mitigation to be passed by the state legislature. we have continued to work with elected officials and regulators on constructive ways to achieve rate mitigation. however, in the last legislative session, certain pennsylvania legislators introduced legislation to extend generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for pennsylvania utilities beyond the end of their transition periods, which in ppl electric's case is december 31, 2009. ppl and ppl electric have expressed strong concern regarding the severe potential consequences of such rate caps or legislation on customer service, system reliability, adequate future generation supply and ppl electric's financial viability. it is possible that similar legislation could be reintroduced. if such legislation were introduced and ultimately enacted, ppl electric could face severe financial consequences including operating losses and significant cash flow shortfalls. in addition, continuing uncertainty regarding ppl electric's ability to recover its market supply and other costs of operating its business after 2009 could adversely affect its credit quality, financing costs and availability of credit facilities necessary to operate its business. whether we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into power purchase contracts to mitigate market price and delivery risk, and our ability to recover costs associated with such contracts, may affect our earnings. in order to mitigate the risk that we will not be able to obtain adequate energy supply after 2009 when our full requirements energy supply agreements with ppl energyplus expire, we have entered into power purchase agreements that include fixed prices. whether we decide or are able to continue to enter into such agreements, and the market conditions at that time, will affect our financial performance. for instance, in the absence of power purchase agreements, we would purchase energy, capacity and other products in the competitive wholesale power markets at then-current market prices. the current forward prices for electricity exceed the prices available under some of our current power sales agreements, and our financial performance will be affected by our ability to enter into new supply contracts, the duration and pricing of such contracts relative to prevailing market conditions, and the regulatory treatment for such contracts and the associated recovery of our supply costs. depending on these factors, our financial results may be materially adversely affected. other risks related to all segments ( ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric ) the current economic and financial market downturn could continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our business has been impacted by the current recession in the u.s. and related market factors, along with the economic downturn world-wide. the breadth and depth of these negative economic conditions have had a wide-ranging impact on the u.s. and international business environment, including our business, and the adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations may continue. as a result of the economic downturn, economic activity has declined significantly, along with demand for electric power. this reduced demand will continue to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets we serve (such as pjm) and our pennsylvania and u.k. delivery businesses, especially industrial customer demand. the combination of lower demand for power and decreased natural gas prices has put downward price pressure on the wholesale energy market in general, further impacting our energy marketing results. in general, market volatility in energy and fuel prices is expected to continue, decreasing the predictability regarding our unhedged future energy margins, liquidity and general financial condition. our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and capital for, among other things, funding our need for collateral to support hedging in our energy marketing business. global bank credit capacity has been reduced dramatically and the cost of renewing or establishing new credit facilities has increased significantly. new bank credit facilities generally are being restricted to less than one-year terms, thereby introducing uncertainties as to businesses' ability to enter into long-term energy commitments or reliably estimate the longer-term cost and availability of credit. in addition, although we have reduced our planned capital expenditures, we still have substantial financing requirements over the next several years. we expect to have adequate access to needed credit and capital for these purposes; however, our financing costs are expected to increase and the continued financial market downturn could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. the current economic and financial market downturn is expected to continue to adversely impact numerous other factors in our business operations discussed elsewhere in this risk factor section. our operating results could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of severe weather conditions. our businesses are seasonal. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during the hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in the cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when severe weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold weather or storms make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the nature and location of the facilities we acquire or develop and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity. we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "legal matters," "regulatory issues" and in "environmental matters - domestic" in note 15 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. we may need significant additional financing to pursue growth opportunities. we continually review potential acquisitions and development projects and may enter into significant acquisition agreements or development commitments in the future. an acquisition agreement or development commitment may require access to substantial capital from outside sources on acceptable terms. we also may need external financing to fund capital expenditures, including capital expenditures necessary to comply with environmental regulations or other regulatory requirements. our ability to arrange financing and our cost of capital are dependent on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, credit availability and our financial performance. arranging such financing is difficult as a result of the current financial market downturn. the inability to obtain sufficient financing on terms that are acceptable to us could adversely affect our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and fund capital expenditures. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. our current credit ratings by moody's, fitch and s&amp;p, including a january 2009 review by s&amp;p that resulted in a negative outlook for us, are listed in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources." while we do not expect these ratings to limit our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs and/or access any new long-term debt, any ratings downgrades could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund our short-term liquidity needs and access new long-term debt. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting, and reducing where possible, our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. the cost of materials and labor result from general inflation, increased nationwide plant construction and other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to current employees and retirees covered by the contracts. we provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. for example, our projected pension costs have increased significantly as a result of the decreased investment returns and interest rates due to the economic downturn in the u.s. and world-wide. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs could increase significantly. there is a risk that we may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings. under gaap, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. while no goodwill impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2008, we are unable to predict whether any impairment charges may be necessary in the future. we also review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. during 2008, ppl recorded an impairment charge related to a cancelled hydroelectric expansion project and certain emission allowances and recorded an additional impairment charge related to its natural gas distribution and propane businesses that were sold in october. during 2007, ppl impaired certain transmission rights, certain domestic telecommunications assets, certain assets of the natural gas distribution and propane businesses, and the net assets of our bolivian businesses prior to their sale in july 2007. during 2006, ppl recorded a loss on the sale of our interest in the griffith plant and fully impaired our synfuel-related assets. see notes 9, 10 and 15 to the financial statements. we are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future years. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppl corporation, ppl energy supply, llc and ppl electric utilities

business background ppl corporation , headquartered in allentown, pa, is an energy and utility holding company that was incorporated in 1994. through its subsidiaries, ppl generates electricity from power plants in the northeastern and western u.s., markets wholesale or retail energy primarily in the northeastern and western portions of the u.s. and delivers electricity to approximately 4 million customers in pennsylvania and the u.k. ppl's significant subsidiaries are shown below: in addition to ppl corporation, the other sec registrants included in this filing are: ppl energy supply, llc , an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ppl formed in 2000, is an energy company engaged through its subsidiaries in the generation and marketing of power, primarily in the northeastern and western power markets of the u.s. and in the delivery of electricity in the u.k. ppl energy supply's major operating subsidiaries are ppl generation, ppl energyplus and ppl global. at december 31, 2009, ppl energy supply owned or controlled 11,719 mw of electric power generation capacity and has plans to implement capital projects at certain of its existing generation facilities in pennsylvania and montana to provide 239 mw of additional generating capacity by 2014. ppl electric utilities corporation , incorporated in 1920, is a direct subsidiary of ppl and a regulated public utility. ppl electric provides electricity delivery service in its service territory in pennsylvania and provides electricity supply to retail customers in that territory as a plr under the customer choice act. segment information ppl is organized into three segments: supply, pennsylvania delivery and international delivery. ppl energy supply's segments consist of supply and international delivery. ppl electric operates in a single business segment. see note 2 to the financial statements for financial information about the segments and geographic financial data. supply segment - owns and operates domestic power plants to generate electricity; markets and trades this electricity and other purchased power to deregulated wholesale and retail markets; and acquires and develops domestic generation projects. consists primarily of the activities of ppl generation and ppl energyplus. ppl energy supply has generation assets that are located in the eastern and western u.s. markets. the eastern generation assets are located in the northeast/mid-atlantic energy markets - including pjm, the new york iso and iso new england. ppl energy supply's western generating capacity is located in markets within the western electricity coordinating council. ppl energy supply owned or controlled generation capacity ppl energy supply owned or controlled generating capacity of 11,719 mw at december 31, 2009. through subsidiaries, ppl generation owns and operates power plants primarily in pennsylvania, montana, illinois, connecticut, new york and maine. the total owned or controlled generating capacity includes power obtained through ppl energyplus' tolling or power purchase agreements (including ironwood and other facilities that consist of nugs, wind farms and landfill gas facilities). see "item 2. properties - supply segment" for a complete listing of ppl energy supply's generating capacity. ppl energy supply's u.s. generation subsidiaries are ewgs, which sell electricity into the wholesale market. ppl energy supply's ewgs are subject to regulation by the ferc, which has authorized these ewgs to sell generation from their facilities at market-based prices. the electricity from these plants is sold to ppl energyplus under ferc-jurisdictional power purchase agreements. ppl generation operates its pennsylvania and illinois power plants in conjunction with pjm. ppl generation's pennsylvania and illinois power plants and ppl energyplus are members of the rfc. refer to "pennsylvania delivery segment" for information regarding pjm's operations and functions and the rfc. pennsylvania generation had a total capacity of 9,583 mw at december 31, 2009. these plants are fueled by uranium, coal, natural gas, oil, water and other fuels. ppl susquehanna, a subsidiary of ppl generation, owns a 90% undivided interest in each of the two nuclear-fueled generating units at its susquehanna station in pennsylvania. allegheny electric cooperative, inc. owns the remaining 10% undivided interest. ppl's 90% share of susquehanna's generating capacity was 2,206 mw at december 31, 2009. the illinois natural gas-fired station has a total capacity of 585 mw. the montana coal-fired and hydroelectric-powered stations have a capacity of 1,286 mw. ppl montana's power plants are operated in conjunction with the western electricity coordinating council. the connecticut natural gas-fired station has a total capacity of 244 mw, is operated in conjunction with iso new england and the northeast power coordinating council. the new york oil/gas-fired stations have a capacity of 159 mw. these generating assets are operated in conjunction with the new york iso and the northeast power coordinating council. tolling agreements are in place for 100% of the capacity and output of this business. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information on the anticipated sale of the long island generation business. the maine hydroelectric-powered stations have a total capacity of 12 mw. the maine generating assets are operated in conjunction with iso new england and the northeast power coordinating council. see note 9 to the financial statements for information on the november 2009 sale of the majority of the maine hydroelectric business, the sale of ppl's interest in an oil-fired unit in maine and the conditional agreement of sale for the remaining three hydroelectric facilities. ppl generation has current plans for capital projects at certain of its generation facilities in pennsylvania and montana to provide 239 mw of additional generation capacity for its use by 2014. see "item 2. properties - supply segment" for additional information regarding these capital projects. refer to the "power supply" section for additional information regarding electricity generated by the power plants operated by ppl generation and to the "fuel supply" section for a discussion of fuel requirements and contractual arrangements for fuel. a subsidiary of ppl energy supply develops renewable energy plants on various sites using technologies such as turbines, reciprocating engines and photovoltaic solar panels. included in ppl energy supply's owned or controlled generating capacity reported in "item 2. properties - supply segment" is approximately 28 mw of installed capacity from these projects that serve commercial and industrial customers. certain ppl energy supply subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of certain federal, regional, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. ppl susquehanna is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of the susquehanna units. certain of ppl energy supply's other subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of their fossil plants with respect to certain level and density monitoring devices. certain operations of ppl generation's subsidiaries are subject to the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and comparable state statutes. energy marketing ppl energyplus sells the electricity produced by ppl generation subsidiaries, along with purchased power, ftrs, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances and recs in competitive wholesale and deregulated retail markets in order to take advantage of opportunities in the competitive energy marketplace. ppl energyplus purchases and sells electric capacity and energy at the wholesale level at competitive prices under ferc market-based prices. ppl energyplus enters into these agreements to market available energy and capacity from ppl generation's assets and to profit from market price fluctuations. within the constraints of its hedging policy, ppl energyplus actively manages its portfolios to optimize the value of ppl's generating assets and to limit exposure to price fluctuations. ppl energyplus also enters into over-the-counter and futures contracts to purchase and sell energy and other commodity-based financial instruments in accordance with ppl's risk management policies, objectives and strategies. ppl energyplus had contracted to provide electricity to ppl electric sufficient for it to meet its plr obligation through 2009 at the predetermined capped rates ppl electric was entitled to charge its customers. these contracts accounted for 29% of ppl energy supply's operating revenues in 2009 and expired december 31, 2009. see note 15 to the financial statements for more information concerning these contracts. ppl energyplus is licensed to provide retail electric supply to customers in delaware, maine, massachusetts, maryland, montana, new jersey and pennsylvania and provides electricity to industrial and commercial customers in montana and pennsylvania. ppl energyplus provides natural gas to customers in pennsylvania, new jersey, delaware and maryland. competition the unregulated businesses and markets in which ppl and its subsidiaries participate are highly competitive. since the early 1990s, there has been increased competition in u.s. energy markets because of federal and state deregulation initiatives. for example, in 1992 the energy act amended the federal power act to provide open access to electric transmission systems for wholesale transactions. in 1996, the customer choice act was enacted in pennsylvania to restructure the state's electric utility industry to create a competitive market for electricity generation. certain other states in which ppl's subsidiaries operate have also adopted "customer choice" plans to allow customers to choose their electricity supplier. ppl and its subsidiaries believe that competition in deregulated energy markets will continue to be intense. the supply segment faces competition in wholesale markets for available energy, capacity and ancillary services. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. the supply segment primarily competes with other electricity suppliers based on its ability to aggregate generation supply at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. competitors in wholesale power markets include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators, unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy marketers. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to supply segment" and ppl's and ppl energy supply's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview" for more information concerning the risks faced with respect to competition in deregulated energy markets. power supply ppl energy supply's owned or controlled system capacity (winter rating) at december 31, 2009 was 11,719 mw. the capacity of generating units is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances. see "item 2. properties - supply segment" for a description of ppl energy supply's plants at december 31, 2009. during 2009, ppl energy supply's plants, excluding renewable facilities that are discussed separately below, generated the following amounts of electricity. state millions of kwh pennsylvania 46,019 montana 8,120 maine 261 connecticut 108 new york (a) illinois 64 total 54,572 (a) 72 million kwhs were excluded as tolling agreements were in place for 100% of the output. of this generation, 49% of the energy was from coal-fired stations, 32% from nuclear operations at the susquehanna station, 11% from oil/gas-fired stations and 8% from hydroelectric stations. ppl energy supply estimates that, on average, approximately 94% of its total expected annual generation output for 2010 will be used to meet energyplus' committed contractual sales. ppl energy supply has also entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for the years 2011 and beyond. these commitments are consistent with, and integral to, ppl energy supply's business strategy to capture profits while managing exposure to adverse movements in energy and fuel prices. see "commodity volumetric activity" in note 18 to the financial statements for the strategies ppl energy supply employs to optimize the value of its wholesale and retail energy portfolio. subsidiaries of ppl energy supply controlled existing renewable energy projects located in pennsylvania, new jersey, vermont and new hampshire with capacity of 28 mw. ppl energyplus sells the energy and recs produced by these plants to commercial, industrial and institutional customers. during 2009, these projects generated 145 million kwhs. in addition, a ppl energy supply subsidiary owns renewable energy facilities with capacity of 6 mw that have power purchase agreements in place. during 2009, these projects generated 23 million kwhs. ppl energyplus also purchases the full output from two wind farms in pennsylvania with a combined capacity of 50 mw. fuel supply coal pennsylvania ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, actively manages ppl's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in central and northern appalachia. during 2009, ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, purchased 100% of the coal delivered to ppl generation's wholly owned pennsylvania stations under short-term and long-term contracts. these contracts provided ppl generation 7.3 million tons of coal. contracts currently in place are expected to provide 7.8 million tons in 2010. the amount of coal in inventory varies from time to time depending on market conditions and plant operations. ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, entered into a long-term coal purchase agreement with consol energy inc. the contract will provide more than one-third of ppl generation's projected annual coal needs for the pennsylvania power plants from 2010 through 2018. ppl generation has other contracts that, in total, will provide additional coal supply for ppl's projected annual needs from 2010 through 2013. a ppl generation subsidiary owns a 12.34% interest in the keystone station and a 16.25% interest in the conemaugh station. the keystone station contracts with keystone fuels, llc for its coal requirements. in 2009, keystone fuels, llc provided 4.8 million tons of coal to the keystone station. the conemaugh station requirements are purchased under contract from conemaugh fuels, llc. in 2009, conemaugh fuels, llc provided 4.8 million tons of coal to the conemaugh station. a ppl generation subsidiary also owns a 12.34% equity interest in keystone fuels, llc and a 16.25% equity interest in conemaugh fuels, llc. scrubbers were placed in service at montour in 2008 and at brunner island in 2009. at december 31, 2009, scrubbers were in place at all of ppl generation's pennsylvania coal stations. contracts are in place for all the limestone requirements for all the scrubbers at ppl generation's wholly owned pennsylvania coal stations through 2010. it is projected that annual limestone requirements will be approximately 600,000 tons. during 2009, approximately 325,000 tons of limestone were delivered to ppl generation's wholly owned pennsylvania stations under long-term contracts. montana ppl montana has a 50% leasehold interest in colstrip units 1 and 2, and a 30% leasehold interest in colstrip unit 3. northwestern owns a 30% leasehold interest in colstrip unit 4. ppl montana and northwestern have a sharing agreement to govern each party's responsibilities regarding the operation of colstrip units 3 and 4, and each party is responsible for 15% of the respective operating and construction costs, regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to colstrip unit 3 or 4. however, each party is responsible for its own fuel-related costs. ppl montana, along with the other owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined coal quality characteristics and specifications. in 2007, ppl montana entered into a long-term purchase and supply agreement with the current supplier for units 1 and 2 beginning january 1, 2010. the contract is to provide these units 100% of their coal requirements through december 2014, and at least 85% of such requirements from january 2015 through december 2019. the coal supply contract for unit 3's requirements is in effect through december 2019. scrubbers are in place at all of these units. coal supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality characteristics and specifications for ppl montana's corette station. the contracts covered 100% of the station's coal requirements in 2009, and similar contracts are currently in place to supply 100% of the expected coal requirements through 2012. oil and natural gas pennsylvania ppl generation's martins creek units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas. ppl energyplus is responsible for procuring the oil and natural gas supply for all ppl generation operations. during 2009, 100% of the physical gas and oil requirements for the martins creek units were purchased on the spot market. at december 31, 2009, ppl energyplus had no long-term agreements for oil or gas. ppl energyplus has a short-term and long-term gas transportation contract in place for approximately 30% of the maximum daily requirements of the lower mt. bethel facility. in 2008, ppl energyplus acquired the rights to an existing long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of the ironwood facility. ppl energyplus has long-term transportation contracts to serve approximately 25% of ironwood's maximum daily requirements, which begins in the fourth quarter of 2010. for the first three quarters of 2010, ironwood will be served through a combination of transportation capacity release transactions and delivered supply to the plant. ppl energyplus currently has no long-term physical supply agreements to purchase natural gas for ironwood. illinois at december 31, 2009, there were no long-term delivery or supply agreements to purchase natural gas for the university park facility. connecticut ppl energyplus has a long-term contract for approximately 40% of the expected pipeline transportation requirements of the wallingford facility, but has no long-term physical supply agreement to purchase natural gas. nuclear the nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. ppl susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services. these contracts are expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of 2016 and unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2015. ppl susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued operation of the nuclear units. federal law requires the federal government to provide for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel. under the federal nuclear waste policy act, the doe carried out an analysis of a site in nevada for a permanent nuclear waste repository. there is no definitive date by which a repository will be operational. as a result, it was necessary to expand susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity. to support this expansion, ppl susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage technology. the facility is modular, so that additional storage capacity can be added as needed. the facility began receiving spent nuclear fuel in 1999. ppl susquehanna estimates that there is sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approximately 2017 under current operating conditions. if necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained. if additional on-site storage capacity is required, supplementary storage capacity will be pursued. franchise and licenses see "background - segment information - supply segment - energy marketing" for a discussion of ppl energyplus' licenses in various states. ppl energyplus also has an export license from the doe to sell capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in canada. ppl susquehanna operates units 1 and 2 pursuant to nrc operating licenses. in november 2009, the nrc approved ppl susquehanna's application for 20-year license renewals for each of the susquehanna units, extending the license expiration dates to 2042 for unit 1 and to 2044 for unit 2. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. in 2008, ppl susquehanna received nrc approval for its request to increase the generation capacity of the susquehanna nuclear plant. the total expected capacity increase is 159 mw, of which ppl susquehanna's 90% ownership share would be 143 mw. the first uprate for unit 1 totaling 50 mw was completed in 2008 and the second uprate is scheduled to be completed in 2010. the first uprate for unit 2 totaling 50 mw was completed in 2009, and the second uprate is scheduled to be completed in 2011. the remaining total capacity increase is 59 mw, of which ppl susquehanna's share is 53 mw. ppl susquehanna's share of the expected capital cost for the total uprate of 143 mw is $345 million. in october 2008, a ppl subsidiary submitted a cola to the nrc for a new nuclear generating unit (bell bend) to be built adjacent to the susquehanna plant. the cola was accepted for review by the nrc in december 2008. in may 2009, the nrc published its official review schedule that culminates with the issuance of bell bend's final safety evaluation report in 2012. see note 8 to financial statements for additional information. ppl holtwood operates the holtwood hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license that was recently extended by the ferc to expire in 2030. ppl holtwood operates the wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license renewed by the ferc in 2005 and expiring in 2044. ppl holtwood also owns one-third of the capital stock of safe harbor water power corporation (safe harbor), which holds a project license that extends the operation of its hydroelectric generating station until 2030. the total capacity of the safe harbor generating station is 421 mw, and ppl holtwood is entitled by contract to one-third of the total capacity. in 2007, ppl requested ferc approval to expand its holtwood plant by 125 mw. in 2008, ppl withdrew the application in light of prevailing economic conditions, including the high cost of capital and projections of future energy prices. ppl reconsidered its holtwood expansion project in view of the tax incentives and potential loan guarantees for renewable energy projects contained in the economic stimulus package. in april 2009, ppl resubmitted the expansion application to ferc and in october 2009, the ferc approved the request to expand the plant and extended the operating license through august 2030. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. the 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir in montana are licensed by the ferc. these licenses expire periodically and the generating facilities must be relicensed at such times. the ferc license for the mystic facility expired in 2009 but has been extended, effective january 1, 2010, for an additional 40-year term. the thompson falls and kerr licenses expire in 2025 and 2035, respectively; and the licenses for the nine missouri-madison facilities expire in 2040. in connection with the relicensing of these generation facilities, the ferc may, under applicable law, relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee, or the u.s. government may take over the facility. if the original licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing. pennsylvania delivery segment - includes the regulated electric delivery operations of ppl electric. ppl electric ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central pennsylvania. the largest cities in this territory are allentown, bethlehem, harrisburg, hazleton, lancaster, scranton, wilkes-barre and williamsport. ppl electric is the sole electricity distribution provider in its service territory, and also provides electricity supply in that territory as a plr. as part of the puc final order, ppl electric agreed to supply this electricity at predetermined capped rates through 2009. ppl electric entered into two contracts to purchase electricity from ppl energyplus sufficient for ppl electric to meet its plr obligation through 2009 at the capped rates. as discussed below, ppl electric's plr obligation after 2009 is governed by the puc pursuant to the public utility code as amended by act 129, plr regulations and a policy statement regarding interpretation and implementation of those regulations. both the regulations and the policy statement became effective in september 2007. the puc has approved ppl electric's procurement plans for 2010 and for the period from january 2011 through may 2013. refer to notes 14 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information. during 2009, about 98% of ppl electric's operating revenues were derived from regulated electricity delivery and supply as a plr. the remaining 2009 operating revenues were from wholesale revenues, primarily the sale to ppl energyplus of power purchased from nugs. during 2009, about 46% of electricity delivery and plr revenues were from residential customers, 37% from commercial customers, 16% from industrial customers and 1% from other customer classes. ppl electric's transmission facilities are operated as part of pjm, which operates the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. bulk electricity is transmitted to wholesale users throughout a geographic area including all or part of delaware, illinois, indiana, kentucky, maryland, michigan, new jersey, north carolina, ohio, pennsylvania, tennessee, virginia, west virginia and the district of columbia. as of january 1, 2006, ppl electric became a member of the rfc. the purpose of the rfc is to preserve and enhance electric service reliability and security for the interconnected electric systems within its territory and to be a regional entity under the framework of the nerc. the rfc's key functions are the development of regional standards for reliable planning and operation of the bulk electric system and non-discriminatory compliance monitoring and enforcement of both nerc and regional standards. pjm serves as a ferc-approved rto in order to promote greater participation and competition in the region. an rto, like an iso, is a designation provided by the ferc to a ferc-approved independent entity that operates the transmission system and typically administers a competitive power market. pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary purpose of the rto/iso is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets, but the rto/iso directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. ppl electric is entitled to fully recover from retail customers the charges that it pays to pjm for transmission-related services. pjm imposes these charges pursuant to its ferc-approved open access transmission tariff. ppl electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the puc, and certain of its activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the federal power act. ppl electric also is subject to the jurisdiction of certain federal, regional, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to land use and other environmental matters. certain operations of ppl electric are subject to the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and comparable state statutes. in november 2004, pennsylvania enacted the alternative energy portfolio standard (the aeps), which requires electric distribution companies, such as ppl electric, and retail electric suppliers serving retail load to ultimately provide 18% of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania from alternative energy sources by 2020. under this state law, alternative energy sources include hydro, wind, solar, waste coal, landfill methane and fuel cells. an electric distribution company will pay an alternative compliance payment of $45 (or, in the case of solar, 200% of the average market value of solar credits) for each mwh that it is short of its required alternative energy supply percentage. ppl electric became subject to the requirements of this legislation beginning in 2010. in 2010, ppl electric is required to supply about 9% of the total amount of electricity it delivers to its plr customers from alternative energy sources. ppl electric has purchased all of the supply required to meet its 2010 default service obligations pursuant to a puc-approved competitive bridge plan (the plan). under the plan, ppl electric obtained full requirements service which includes the generation or credits that ppl electric will need to comply with the aeps in 2010. act 129 became effective in october 2008. the law creates an energy efficiency and conservation program and smart metering technology requirements, adopts new plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and makes changes to the existing aeps. see "regulatory issues - pennsylvania activities" in note 14 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129, other legislative and regulatory impacts and ppl electric's actions to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2009. competition pursuant to authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. effective january 1, 2010, ppl electric's rates for generation supply as a plr are no longer capped and the cost of electric generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. prior to the expiration of the generation rate caps, ppl electric's customers' interest in purchasing generation supply from other providers was limited because, in recent years, the long-term supply agreement between ppl electric and ppl energyplus provided a below-market cost of generation supply for these customers. as a result, a limited amount of "shopping" occurred. in 2010, several alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in ppl electric's service territory. when its customers purchase supply from these alternative suppliers or from ppl electric as plr, the purchase of such supply has no significant impact on the operating results of ppl electric. the cost to purchase plr supply is passed directly by ppl electric to its customers without markup. ppl electric remains the distribution provider for all the customers in its service territory and charges a regulated rate for the service of delivering that electricity. provider of last resort supply the customer choice act requires electric distribution companies, like ppl electric, to act as a plr of electricity supply and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations established by the puc. in may 2007, the puc approved ppl electric's plan to procure default electricity supply for 2010 - after its current supply agreements with ppl energyplus expire - for retail customers who do not choose an alternative competitive supplier. pursuant to this plan, ppl electric completed six competitive supply solicitations and has contracted for all of the 2010 electricity supply it expects to need for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. in october 2009, ppl electric purchased supply for fixed-price default service to large commercial and large industrial customers who elect to take that service in 2010. in november 2009, ppl electric purchased supply to provide hourly default service to large commercial and industrial customers in 2010. see "energy purchase commitments" in note 14 to the financial statements for additional information regarding ppl electric's solicitations for 2010 and its actions to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2010. franchise and licenses ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies to which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. international delivery segment - includes wpd, a regulated electricity distribution company in the u.k. wpd, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, operates two of the 15 distribution networks providing electricity service in the u.k. the wpd subsidiaries together serve approximately 2.6 million end-users in the u.k. wpd (south west) serves 1.5 million customers in a 5,560 square mile area of southwest england. wpd (south wales) serves an area of wales opposite the bristol channel from wpd (south west)'s territory. its 1.1 million customers occupy 4,550 square miles within wales. wpd is headquartered in bristol, england. see "franchise and licenses" for additional information about wpd's regulator, ofgem, which sets price controls and grants distribution licenses. competition although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to residential customers. see "franchises and licenses" for more information. franchise and licenses wpd is authorized by the u.k. government to provide electric distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. for instance, wpd is subject to governmental regulation of the prices it can charge and the quality of service it must provide, and wpd can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service. wpd operates under distribution licenses granted, and price controls set, by ofgem. the price control formula that governs wpd's allowed revenue is normally determined every five years. ofgem completed a rate review in december 2009 for the five-year period from april 1, 2010 through march 31, 2015. see ppl's and ppl energy supply's "results of operations - segment results - international delivery segment" in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for additional information. seasonality demand for and market prices of electricity are affected by weather. as a result, ppl's overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities ppl owns and the terms of its contracts to purchase or sell electricity. financial condition see ppl's, ppl energy supply's and ppl electric's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for this information. capital expenditure requirements see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - - capital expenditures" in ppl's, ppl energy supply's and ppl electric's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for the years 2010-2012. see note 14 to the financial statements for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures from environmental matters. environmental matters ppl and certain ppl subsidiaries, including ppl electric and ppl generation subsidiaries, are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. see ppl's and ppl energy supply's "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources" in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" for information concerning environmental capital expenditures during 2009 and projected environmental capital expenditures for the years 2010-2012. see "environmental matters" in note 14 to the financial statements for information regarding these laws and regulations and the status of ppl's and its subsidiaries' compliance and remediation activities, as well as legal and regulatory proceedings involving ppl and its subsidiaries. ppl and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities and operations and competitive positions. in complying with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including, among other things, air and water quality, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous and solid waste management and disposal, and regulation of toxic substances, ppl's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain of their facilities. ppl's subsidiaries may also incur significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but could be significant. employee relations as of december 31, 2009, ppl and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees. ppl energy supply ppl generation 2,665 ppl energyplus 2,020 (a) ppl global (primarily wpd) 2,369 total ppl energy supply 7,054 ppl electric 2,166 ppl services and other 1,269 total ppl 10,489 (a) includes union employees of mechanical contracting subsidiaries, whose numbers tend to fluctuate due to the nature of this business. approximately 4,980, or 61%, of ppl's domestic workforce are members of labor unions, with three ibew locals representing approximately 3,540 employees. other unions primarily represent employees of the mechanical contractors. the bargaining agreement with the largest ibew local was negotiated in may 2006 and expires in may 2010. this agreement covers approximately 3,200 employees. the ibew, representing approximately 260 employees at the montana colstrip power plants, is covered under a four-year labor agreement expiring in april 2012. in january 2008, a four-year contract that expires in april 2012 was renegotiated with the ibew local of montana that represents approximately 80 employees at the hydroelectric facilities and at the corette plant. approximately 1,860, or 79%, of ppl's u.k. workforce are members of labor unions. wpd recognizes five unions, the largest of which represents 37% of its union workforce. wpd's electricity business agreement covers approximately 1,810 union employees; it may be amended by agreement between wpd and the unions and is terminable with 12 months notice by either side. see "separation benefits" in note 12 to the financial statements for information on a 2009 cost reduction initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 200 domestic management and staff positions at ppl. available information ppl's internet web site is www.pplweb.com. on the investor center page of that web site, ppl provides access to all sec filings of ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec. additionally, ppl registrants' filings are available at the

electric face various risks associated with their businesses. while we have identified below the risks we currently consider material, these risks are not the only risks that we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. in addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 14 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. as used in this item 1a., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to ppl energy supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the supply and international delivery segment discussions, or ppl electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania delivery segment discussion. risks related to supply segment ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) we are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale electricity markets. we purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based tariffs authorized by the ferc throughout the u.s. and also enter into short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price fluctuations. if we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay damages. these damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of any undelivered capacity or electricity. depending on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be significant. extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, environmental compliance costs, transmission disruptions, and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and electricity. our power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post collateral for the benefit of our counterparties if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. at december 31, 2009, we had posted $242 million of collateral, in the form of letters of credit, under these contracts. at december 31, 2009, we maintained $4.1 billion of liquidity facilities to provide for potential additional collateral obligations. we currently believe that we have sufficient credit to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these power contracts. our obligation to post collateral could exceed the amount of our facilities or our ability to increase our facilities could be limited by financial market or other factors. we also face credit risk that parties with whom we contract will default in their performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the time of contract. whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these risks by various means, including agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract price in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. however, there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance, which could adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations to other parties, which could in turn subject us to claims for damages. adverse changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. our energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power exceed our costs to supply power, are impacted by changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, recs, electricity transmission and related congestion charges and other costs. unlike most commodities, the limited ability to store electric power requires that it must be consumed at the time of production. as a result, wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable. among the factors that influence such prices are: demand for electricity and supplies of electricity available from current or new generation resources; variable production costs, primarily fuel (and the associated fuel transportation costs) and emission allowance expense for the generation resources used to meet the demand for electricity; transmission capacity and service into, or out of, markets served; changes in the regulatory framework for wholesale power markets; liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, as well as general credit worthiness of key participants in the market; and weather and economic conditions impacting demand for electricity or the facilities necessary to deliver electricity. see exhibit 99(a) for more information concerning the market fluctuations in wholesale energy, fuel and emission allowance prices over the past five years. the volatility of these business factors has increased significantly with the current economic downturn. our risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency and counterparties may not work as planned, and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs. we actively manage the market risk inherent in our generation energy marketing activities, as well as our debt, foreign currency and counterparty credit positions. we have implemented procedures to monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs, including independent validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, portfolio stress test, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics. nonetheless, our risk management programs may not work as planned. for example, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management calculations. additionally, unforeseen market disruptions could decrease market depth and liquidity, negatively impacting our ability to enter into new transactions. we enter into financial contracts to hedge commodity basis risk, and as a result are exposed to the risk that the correlation between delivery points could change with actual physical delivery. similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not designed to address. as a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events result in greater losses or costs than our risk models predict or greater volatility in our earnings and financial position. in addition, our trading, marketing and hedging activities are exposed to counterparty credit risk and market liquidity risk. we have adopted a credit risk management policy and program to evaluate counterparty credit risk. however, if counterparties fail to perform, the risk of which has increased due to the economic downturn, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices. in that event, our financial results are likely to be adversely affected. we do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price volatility. we attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity sales obligations by either reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and services through competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts. we also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements and other electricity-related commodities. however, based on economic and other considerations, we may not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. we face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. unlike our regulated delivery businesses, our energy supply business is dependent on our ability to operate in a competitive environment and is not assured of any rate of return on capital investments through a predetermined rate structure. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. these competitive factors may negatively impact our ability to sell electricity and related products and services, as well as the prices that we may charge for such products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow our business. we sell our available energy and capacity into the competitive wholesale markets through contracts with various durations. competition in the wholesale power markets occurs principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and availability. we believe that the commencement of commercial operation of new electric facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity and the evolution of demand side management resources will continue to increase the competitiveness of the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have a material adverse effect on the prices we receive for electricity. we also face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary services. we primarily compete with other electricity suppliers based on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. we also compete against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to credit sources, and our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. competitors in the wholesale power markets in which ppl generation subsidiaries and ppl energyplus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators and unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities. in the past, puhca significantly restricted mergers and acquisitions and other investments in the electric utility sector. entirely new competitors, including financial institutions, have entered the energy markets as a result of the repeal of puhca. the repeal of puhca also may lead to consolidation in our industry, resulting in competitors with significantly greater financial resources than we have. disruptions in our fuel supplies could occur, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our generation facilities. we purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. disruption in the delivery of fuel and other products consumed during the production of electricity (such as lime, limestone and other chemicals), including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. despite federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or prevent or delay operation of our facilities. our generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market. generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the ferc. the ferc has authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices. the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates. any reduction by the ferc in the rates we may receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations. see "ferc market-based rate authority" in note 14 to the financial statements for information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the ferc's market-based rate authority program, and "pjm rpm litigation" in note 14 to the financial statements for information regarding the ferc's proceedings that could impact pjm's capacity pricing model. in addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals. if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to additional costs. our generation facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our financial performance. our ability to manage operational risk with respect to our generation plants is critical to our financial performance. operation of our power plants at expected capacity levels involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, labor disputes and fuel interruption. in addition, weather and natural disasters can disrupt our generation plants. weather conditions also have a direct impact on the river flows required to operate our hydroelectric plants at expected capacity levels. depending on the timing and duration of both planned and unplanned, complete or partial outages at our power plants (in particular, if such outages are during peak periods or during periods of, or caused by, severe weather), or if our planned uprates at power plants are not completed as scheduled, our revenues from expected energy sales could significantly decrease and our expenses significantly increase, and we could be required to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our energy sales commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. many of our generating units are reaching mid-life, and we face the potential for more frequent unplanned outages and the possibility of planned outages of longer duration to accommodate significant investments in major component replacements at these facilities. changes in technology may negatively impact the value of our power plants. a basic premise of our business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at relatively low prices. there are alternate technologies to produce electricity, most notably fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells, the development of which has been expanded due to global climate change concerns. research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in alternate technologies. it is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternate methods of electricity production to a level that is equal to or below that of certain central station production. also, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators. these alternative energy sources could result in a decline to the dispatch and capacity factors of our plants. as a result of all of these factors, the value of our generation facilities could be significantly reduced. the load following contracts that ppl energyplus is awarded do not provide for specific levels of load, and actual load significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy margins. we generally hedge our load following obligations with energy purchases from third parties, and to a lesser extent with its owned generation. if the actual load is significantly lower than the expected load, we may be required to resell power at a lower price than was purchased to supply the load obligation, resulting in a financial loss. alternatively, a significant increase in load could adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of the load following contracts to provide the energy necessary to fulfill increased demand at the contract price, which could be lower than the cost to procure additional energy on the open market. therefore, any significant decrease or increase in load compared to our forecasts, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. our earnings may be affected by whether we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into or renew long-term power sale, fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements to mitigate market price and supply risk. as a result of the plr contracts and certain other agreements, a substantial portion of our generation production and capacity value was committed through 2009 under power sales agreements of various terms that included fixed prices for electric power. with the expiration of these agreements we have been actively selling our generation at fixed prices in the wholesale energy market and participating in load-following or full requirements auctions with utility companies in the pjm, new england power pool and midwest iso regions. in connection with these activities, we have entered into longer-term fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements that include fixed prices for a significant portion of our forecasted needs. whether we decide to, or are able to, continue to enter into such agreements or renew existing agreements in the future, prevailing market conditions will affect our financial performance. for example, in the absence of long-term power sales agreements, we would sell the energy, capacity and other products from our facilities in the competitive wholesale power markets under contracts of shorter duration at then-current market prices. current forward prices for electricity are lower than the prices under some of our existing power sales agreements. in addition, if we do not secure or maintain favorable fuel purchase and transportation agreements for our power generation facilities, our fuel costs (and associated fuel transportation costs) could exceed the revenues we derive from our energy sales. given the volatility and potential for material differences between actual electricity prices and fuel and other costs, if we do not secure or maintain long-term electricity sales and fuel purchase and fuel transportation agreements, our margins will be subject to increased volatility and, depending on future electricity and fuel costs (and associated fuel transportation costs), our financial results may be materially adversely affected. if market deregulation is reversed or discontinued, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in some markets, state legislators, government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of these markets that have previously been deregulated or permit electricity delivery companies to construct or acquire generating facilities. the isos that oversee the transmission systems in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. these types of price limitations and other mechanisms may reduce profits that our wholesale power marketing and trading business would have realized under competitive market conditions absent such limitations and mechanisms. although we generally expect electricity markets to continue to be competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our industry may be made, and legislative or other action affecting the electric power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or reversed in states in which we currently, or may in the future, operate. we rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control to deliver our wholesale electricity. if transmission is disrupted, or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver power may be hindered. we depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to the wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric generation facilities. if transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by isos, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or we may be unable to sell products on the most favorable terms. the ferc has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that transmission capacity will not be available in the amounts we desire. we cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether isos in applicable markets will efficiently operate transmission networks and provide related services. our costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital expenditures for pollution control improvements that, if delayed, would adversely affect our profitability and liquidity. our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection. to comply with existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control measures we may take, we have spent and expect to spend substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and compliance. in order to comply with existing and recently enacted federal and state environmental laws and regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-fired plants, in 2005 ppl began a program to install scrubbers and other pollution control equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate and nitrogen oxides with co-benefits for mercury emissions reduction). the cost to install this equipment was approximately $1.6 billion, of which $19 million remains to be spent. the remaining unspent balance is included in the 2010 through 2012 capital budget. the scrubbers at our montour and brunner island plants are now in service. many states and environmental groups have challenged certain federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict. as a result, it is possible that state and federal regulations will be adopted that impose more stringent restrictions than are currently in effect, which could require us to significantly increase capital expenditures for pollution control equipment. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for our planned capital projects or which are otherwise necessary to our business. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs. furthermore, at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary equipment, which could cause us to close those units. additionally, the expanding national and international focus on climate change and the related desire to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions has lead to numerous federal legislative and regulatory proposals, and several states already have passed legislation capping carbon dioxide emissions. the continuation of this trend may heighten or make more likely the risks identified above. for more information regarding environmental matters, including existing and proposed federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations to which we are subject, see "environmental matters - domestic" in note 14 to the financial statements. we are subject to the risks of nuclear generation, including the risk that our susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to revised security or safety requirements that would increase our capital and operating expenditures, and uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its licensed life. nuclear generation accounted for about 32% of our 2009 generation output. the risks of nuclear generation generally include: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. the licenses for our two nuclear units expire in 2042 and 2044. see note 20 to the financial statements for additional information on the aro related to the decommissioning. the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, including security, safety and employee-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. in the event of noncompliance, the nrc has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. in addition, revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital or operating expenditures at our susquehanna nuclear plant. in addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our susquehanna plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational loss, damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. risks related to international delivery segment ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) our u.k. delivery business is subject to risks with respect to rate regulation and operational performance. our u.k. delivery business is rate regulated and operates under an incentive-based regulatory framework. in addition, its ability to manage operational risk is critical to its financial performance. disruption to the distribution network could reduce profitability both directly through the higher costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that ofgem has in place relating to customer service levels. in december 2009, ofgem completed its rate review for the five-year period from april 1, 2010 through march 31, 2015, thus reducing regulatory rate risk in the international delivery segment until the next rate review which will be effective april 1, 2015. the results of the rate review are further discussed in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations." the regulated income of the international delivery segment and also the rab are to some extent linked to movements in the retail price index (rpi). reductions in the rpi would adversely impact revenues and the debt/rab ratio. our u.k. delivery business exposes us to risks related to u.k. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and political conditions and policies of the u.k. government. these risks may reduce the results of operations from our u.k. delivery business. the acquisition, financing, development and operation of projects in the u.k. entail significant financial risks including: changes in laws or regulations relating to u.k. operations, including tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies; severe weather and natural disaster impacts on the electric sector and our assets; changes in labor relations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and in converting u.k. revenues to u.s. dollars, which can increase our expenses and/or impair our ability to meet such expenses, and difficulty moving funds out of the country in which the funds were earned; and compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws. risks related to pennsylvania delivery segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) regulators may not approve the rates we request. our pennsylvania delivery business is rate-regulated. while such regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs, including energy supply costs for customers, and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the rates that we may charge our delivery customers are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities. our pennsylvania delivery business is subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will require rate increase requests to the regulators. there is no guarantee that the rates authorized by regulators will match our actual costs or provide a particular return on invested capital at any given time. our transmission and distribution facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our financial performance. our ability to manage operational risk with respect to our transmission and distribution systems is critical to the financial performance of our delivery business. our delivery business also faces several risks, including the breakdown or failure of or damage to equipment or processes (especially due to severe weather or natural disasters), accidents and labor disputes and other factors. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. we may be subject to higher transmission costs and other risks as a result of pjm's regional transmission expansion plan (rtep) process. pjm and the ferc have the authority to require upgrades or expansion of the regional transmission grid, which can result in substantial expenditures for transmission owners. as discussed in note 8 to the financial statements, we expect to make substantial expenditures to construct the susquehanna-roseland transmission line that pjm has determined is necessary for the reliability of the regional transmission grid. although the ferc has granted our request for incentive rate treatment of such facilities, we cannot predict the date when these facilities will be in service or whether delays may occur due to public opposition or other factors. delays could result in significant cost increases for these facilities and decreased reliability of the regional transmission grid. as a result, we cannot predict the ultimate financial or operational impact of this project or other rtep projects on ppl electric. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. under the energy policy act, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are now subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the nerc and enforced by the ferc. compliance with reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures, and violations of these standards could result in substantial penalties. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to pennsylvania conservation and energy efficiency programs. act 129 became effective in october 2008. this law created requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposed new plr electricity supply procurement rules, provided remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing alternative energy portfolio standard. utilities not meeting the requirements of act 129 are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified dates (2011 and 2013). although we expect to meet these requirements, numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. see "regulatory issues - energy policy act of 2005 - reliability standards" in note 14 to the financial statements for additional information. rate deregulation remains subject to political risks. although prior initiatives have not resulted in the enactment of legislation, the possibility remains that certain pennsylvania legislators could introduce legislation to extend generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for pennsylvania utilities after the end of applicable transition periods, which in ppl electric's case was december 31, 2009. if such legislation were introduced and ultimately enacted, ppl electric could face severe financial consequences including operating losses and significant cash flow shortfalls. in addition, continuing uncertainty regarding ppl electric's ability to recover its market supply and other costs of operating its business could adversely affect its credit quality, financing costs and availability of credit facilities necessary to operate its business. other risks related to all segments ( ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric ) we will selectively pursue growth of generation and transmission and distribution capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. we will pursue expansion of our generation and transmission and distribution capacity over the next several years through power uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the potential construction of new power plants, the potential acquisition of existing plants, the potential construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure. we will rigorously scrutinize opportunities to expand our generating capability and may determine not to proceed with any expansion. these types of projects involve numerous risks. any planned power uprates could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs. with respect to the construction of new plants, the acquisition of existing plants, or the construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. the success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory operating contracts, obtaining acceptable financing, maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals. if we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a facility, we would generally be unable to recover our investment in the project. furthermore, we might be unable to run any new or acquired plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings. the economic and financial markets in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in 2008, conditions in the financial markets became disruptive to the processes of managing credit risk, responding to liquidity needs, measuring at fair value derivatives and other financial instruments and managing market risk. the contraction of liquidity in the wholesale energy markets and accompanying significant decline in wholesale energy prices significantly impacted our earnings during the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009. the breadth and depth of these negative economic conditions had a wide-ranging impact on the u.s. and international business environment, including our businesses, and may continue to do so. as a result of the economic downturn, demand for energy commodities has declined significantly. this reduced demand will continue to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets we serve (such as pjm) and our pennsylvania delivery business, especially industrial customer demand. the combination of lower demand for power and natural gas and other fuels has put downward price pressure on the wholesale energy market in general, further impacting our energy marketing results. in general, current economic and commodity market conditions will continue to challenge the predictability regarding our unhedged future energy margins, liquidity and overall financial condition. our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and capital, among other things, for providing collateral to support hedging in our energy marketing business. global bank credit capacity was reduced and the cost of renewing or establishing new credit facilities increased significantly in 2008, primarily as a result of general credit concerns nationwide, thereby introducing uncertainties as to our businesses' ability to enter into long-term energy commitments or reliably estimate the longer-term cost and availability of credit. although bank credit conditions have improved since mid-2009, and we currently expect to have adequate access to needed credit and capital based on current conditions, deterioration in the financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. the current condition of the economic and financial markets in which we operate is expected to continue to impact numerous other aspects of our business operations discussed elsewhere in this risk factor section. our operating results could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of severe weather conditions. our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold weather or severe storms occur. the patterns of these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity. we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "legal matters," "regulatory issues" and in "environmental matters - domestic" in note 14 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. we may need significant additional financing to pursue growth opportunities. we continually review potential acquisitions and development projects and may enter into significant acquisition agreements or development commitments in the future. an acquisition agreement or development commitment may require access to substantial capital from outside sources on acceptable terms. we also may need external financing to fund capital expenditures, including capital expenditures necessary to comply with environmental or other regulatory requirements. our ability to arrange financing and our cost of capital are dependent on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, credit availability and our financial performance. the inability to obtain sufficient financing on terms that are acceptable to us could adversely affect our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and fund capital expenditures. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. our current credit ratings by moody's, fitch and s&amp;p, including a january 2009 review by s&amp;p that resulted in a negative outlook for us, are listed in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - credit ratings." while we do not expect these ratings to limit our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs or access new long-term debt, any ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs and access new long-term debt. see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - ratings triggers" for additional information on the impact of a downgrade in our credit rating. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting and reducing where possible our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements, especially in respect of environmental protection, the need for higher cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. we provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. there is a risk that we may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings. under gaap, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. although no goodwill impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2009, we are unable to predict whether future impairment charges may be necessary. we also review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. during 2009, ppl recorded impairment charges related to certain sulfur dioxide emission allowances and the long island generation business that is being sold. during 2008, ppl recorded impairment charges related to a cancelled hydroelectric expansion project, certain emission allowances and its natural gas distribution and propane businesses that were sold in 2008. during 2007, ppl impaired certain transmission rights, certain domestic telecommunications assets, certain assets of the natural gas distribution and propane businesses, and the net assets of our bolivian businesses prior to their sale in 2007. see notes 8, 9 and 17 to the financial statements for additional information on these charges. we are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future years. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market

framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (the coso criteria). ppl corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting at item 9a. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. in our opinion, ppl corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2009, based on the coso criteria. we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public

incorporated in 1994. through subsidiaries, ppl generates electricity from power plants in the northeastern, northwestern and southeastern u.s., markets wholesale or retail energy primarily in northeastern and northwestern portions of the u.s., delivers electricity to customers in pennsylvania, kentucky, virginia, tennessee and the u.k. and delivers natural gas in kentucky. on november 1, 2010, ppl acquired all of the limited liability company interests of e.on u.s. llc from a wholly owned subsidiary of e.on ag. upon completion of the acquisition, e.on u.s. llc was renamed lg&amp;e and ku energy llc (lke). lke is engaged in regulated uti lity operations through its subsidiaries, ku and lg&amp;e. ppl acquired lke for approximately $7.6 billion, including debt assumed through consolidation. see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information on the acquisition. the acquisition of lke substantially reapportions the mix of ppl's regulated and competitive businesses by increasing the regulated portion of its business, strengthens ppl's credit profile and enhances rate-regulated growth opportunities as the regulated businesses make investments to improve infrastructure and customer reliability. an increase in regulated assets provides earnings stability through regulated returns and the ability to recover costs of capital investments, in contrast to the competitive supply business where earnings and cash flows are subject to market conditions. in 2011, ppl projects that 50% of its net income will be provided by its regulated businesses and the remainder will be provided by its c ompetitive supply businesses. as of december 31, 2010, ppl has: more than $10 billion in projected annual revenues (up from $8.5 billion recorded by ppl in 2010 including two months of lke revenue). 5.3 million utility customers (including 1.3 million served by the kentucky-based companies). approximately 19,000 mw of generation (including 7,700 mw of regulated capacity in the kentucky-based companies). approximately 14,000 full-time employees (including about 3,100 in kentucky). as of december 31, 2010, ppl's principal subsidiaries are shown below (* denotes a sec registrant): in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its 100% membership interest in ppl global to its parent, ppl energy funding, to better align ppl's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements. in addition to ppl corporation, the other sec registrants included in this filing are: ppl energy supply, llc , an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ppl formed in 2000, is an energy company engaged through its subsidiaries in the generation and marketing of electricity, primarily in the northeastern and northwestern power markets of the u.s. and in the delivery of electricity in the u.k. ppl energy supply's major operating subsidiaries are ppl generation, ppl energyplus and ppl global. as noted above, in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its 100% membership interest in ppl global to its parent, ppl energy funding. at december 31, 2010, ppl energy supply owned or controlled 11,729 mw of electric power generation capacity and is implementing capital projects at certain of its existing generation facilities in pennsylvania and montana to provide 247 mw of additional generating capacity by 2013, and is in the process of disposing of certain non-core generation facilities with a capacity of 961 mw in 2011. ppl electric utilities corporation , incorporated in 1920, is a direct subsidiary of ppl and a regulated public utility. ppl electric delivers electricity in its pennsylvania service territory and provides electricity supply to retail customers in that territory as a plr under the customer choice act. ppl's utility subsidiaries, and to a lesser extent certain of its non-utility subsidiaries, are subject to extensive regulation by the ferc including: wholesale sales of power and related transactions, electric transmission service, accounting practices, issuances and sales of securities, acquisitions and sales of utility properties and payments of dividends. ppl is subject to certain ferc regulations as a holding company under puhca 2005 and the federal power act, including with respect to accounting and record-keeping, inter-system sales of non-power goods and services and acquisitions of securities in, or mergers with, certain types of electric utility companies or holding companies. segment information (ppl) following the november 1, 2010 acquisition of lke, ppl is organized into four segments: kentucky regulated, international regulated (formerly international delivery), pennsylvania regulated (formerly pennsylvania delivery) and supply. other than ppl adding a kentucky regulated segment, there were no other changes to reportable segments except the renaming of segments and allocating interest expense related to the equity units to the kentucky regulated segment. (ppl energy supply) at december 31, 2010 , ppl energy supply's segments consisted of supply and international regulated (formerly international delivery). in 2010, there were no changes to these segments except the renaming of segments. however, in january of 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its 100% membership interest in ppl global to its parent, ppl energy funding to better align ppl's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements. (ppl electric) ppl electric operates in a single business segment. (ppl, ppl energy supply, and ppl electric) see note 2 to the financial statements for financial information about the segments and geographic financial data. (ppl) kentucky regulated segment consists of the operations of lke, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of lg&amp;e and ku. the kentucky regulated segment also includes interest expense related to the equity units issued in june 2010 to partially finance the acquisition of lke. lke became a wholly owned subsidiary of ppl on november 1, 2010. lg&amp;e and ku are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky and, in ku's case, virginia and tennessee. ku provides electric service to approximately 514,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western kentucky, to approximately 30,000 customers in five counties in southwestern virginia and less than ten customers in tennessee. in virginia, ku operates under the name old dominion power company. ku also sells wholesale electricity to 12 municipalities in kentucky. lg&amp;e provides electric service to approximately 395,000 customers in louisville and adjacent areas in kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties. lg&amp;e provides natural gas service to approximately 320,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in kentucky. ppl acquisition in september 2010, the kpsc approved a settlement agreement among ppl and all of the intervening parties to ppl's joint application to the kpsc for approval of its acquisition of ownership and control of lke. in the settlement agreement, the parties agreed that lg&amp;e and ku would commit that no base rate increases would take effect before january 1, 2013. the rate increases for lg&amp;e and ku that took effect on august 1, 2010 (as described below) are not impacted by the settlement. under the terms of the settlement, lg&amp;e and ku retain the right to seek approval for the deferral of "extraordinary and uncontrollable costs." interim rate adjustments will continue to be permissible during that period through existing fuel, environmental and demand side management recovery mechanisms. & #160;the agreement also substitutes an acquisition savings shared deferral mechanism for the previous requirement that lg&amp;e and ku file a synergies plan with the kpsc post-closing. this mechanism, which will be in place until the earlier of five years or the first day of the year in which a base rate increase becomes effective, permits lg&amp;e and ku to each earn up to a 10.75% return on equity. any earnings above a 10.75% return on equity will be shared with customers on a 50%/50% basis. the kpsc order and the settlement agreement contained a number of other commitments by lg&amp;e and ku with regard to operations, workforce, community involvement and other matters. in october 2010, both the vscc and the tra approved the transfer of control of lke to ppl. certain of these orders contained additional commitments with regard to operations, workforce, community involvement and other matters. also in october 2010, the ferc approved the application for the transfer of control of the utilities. the approval includes various conditional commitments, such as a continuation of certain existing undertakings with protesters in prior cases, an agreement not to terminate certain ku municipal customer contracts prior to january 2017, an exclusion of any transaction-related costs from wholesale energy and tariff customer rates to the extent that lg&amp;e and ku have agreed to not seek recovery of the same transaction-related cost from retail customers and agreements to coordinate with protesters in certain open or ongoing matters. franchises and licenses lg&amp;e and ku provide electric delivery service, and lg&amp;e provides natural gas distribution service, in their various service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. competition there are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of lke. neither the kentucky general assembly nor the kpsc has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in kentucky. the nature or timing of any legislative or regulatory actions regarding industry restructuring and their impact on lke, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation which implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation; ku's operations in virginia have been and remain regulated. alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels provide indirect competition for natural gas revenues of lke. marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. approximately 25% of lg&amp;e's annual throughput is purchased by large commercial and industrial customers directly from alternate suppliers for delivery through lg&amp;e's distribution system. lg&amp;e's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity; therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact profitability. however, some large industrial and commercial customers may physically bypass lg&amp;e's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems. in april 2010, the kpsc commenced a proceeding to investigate the regulatory, financial and operational aspects of natural gas retail competition programs, and the potential benefits to kentucky consumers. a number of entities, including lg&amp;e, were parties to the proceeding. in december 2010, the kpsc issued an order in the proceeding declining to endorse natural gas competition at the retail level, noting the existence of a number of transition or oversight costs and an uncertain level of economic benefits in such programs. with respect to existing natural gas transportation programs available to large commercial or industrial users, the order indicates that the kpsc will review utilities' current tariff structures, user thresholds and other terms and conditions of such programs, as part of such utili ties' next regular natural gas rate cases. electric operations lke serves approximately 939,000 electric customers. lke's transmission and distribution system territory covers approximately 7,300 square miles. for the period from acquisition through december 31, 2010, 83% of the kentucky regulated segment's operating revenues were derived from electric operations. details of electric revenues by customer class for the period from acquisition through december 31, 2010 are shown below. revenue % of revenue industrial and commercial $ 187 46 residential 163 40 municipal 15 4 other retail 37 9 wholesale 6 1 total $ 408 100 power supply at december 31, 2010, lke owned, controlled or had ownership interest in generating capacity (winter rating) of 7,933 mw in kentucky, indiana, and ohio. see "item 2. properties - kentucky regulated segment" for a complete list of lke's generating capacity. for the period from acquisition through december 31, 2010, lke's power plants generated 6,008 gwh of electricity. during 2010, approximately 95% of the electricity generated by lg&amp;e, and 98% of that generated by ku, was produced by their coal-fired electric generating stations. the remainder was generated by natural gas and oil-fired combustion turbines and hydroelectric power plants. also during 2010, substantially all of the electricity generated was used to supply its retail and municipal customer base. see "item 2. properties - kentucky regulated segment" and note 8 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unit 2 of the trimble county generating station (tc2). with limited exceptions lke took care, custody and control of tc2 on january 22, 2011, and has dispatched the unit to meet customer demand since that date. lg&amp;e and ku and the contractor agreed to a further amendment of the construction agreement whereby the contractor will complete certain actions relating to identifying and completing any necessary modifications to allow operation of tc2 on all fuels in accordance with initial specifications prior to certain dates, and amending the provisions relating to liquidat ed damages. lke cannot currently estimate the ultimate outcome of these matters. lke owns a 75% interest in unit 2. unit 2 is coal-fired and has a capacity of 760 mw, of which lke's share is 570 mw. fuel supply coal is expected to be the predominant fuel used by lg&amp;e and ku for baseload generation for the foreseeable future, with natural gas and oil being used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. lg&amp;e and ku have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2016 and normally augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases. for their existing units, lg&amp;e and ku expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western and eastern kentucky, west virginia, southern indiana, southern illinois and ohio. with the installation of flue gas desulfurization systems (sulfur dioxide removal systems, or scrubbers), lg&amp;e and ku expect their use of higher sulfur coal to increase. in 2011 and beyond, lg&amp;e and ku may purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from wyoming for blending at unit 2 of the trimble county generating station. coal is delivered to the generating stations primarily by barge, truck and rail. natural gas lg&amp;e purchases, transports, distributes or stores natural gas for 320,000 customers in kentucky. its service area covers over 700 square miles in 17 counties and includes 391 miles of transportation mains, consisting of natural gas transmission lines of 255 miles, natural gas storage lines of 119 miles and natural gas combustion turbine lines of 17 miles. lg&amp;e's natural gas distribution system includes 4,235 miles of distribution mains. for the period from acquisition through december 31, 2010, 17% of the kentucky regulated segment's operating revenues were derived from natural gas operations. shown below are details of natural gas revenues by customer class for the period from acquisition through december 31, 2010. revenue % of revenue residential $ 56 66 industrial and commercial 22 26 other retail 5 6 wholesale 2 2 total $ 85 100 lg&amp;e's natural gas billings include a weather normalization adjustment mechanism which adjusts the distribution cost component of residential and commercial customer bills based on normal temperatures during the heating season months of november through april, somewhat mitigating the effect of above- or below-normal weather on residential and commercial revenues. five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 bcf, help provide economical and reliable natural gas service to ultimate consumers. by using natural gas storage facilities, lg&amp;e avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads. natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal the following winter heating season. without this storage capacity, lg&amp;e would be forced to buy additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and when the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are typically at their highest. several suppliers under contracts of varying duration prov ide competitively priced natural gas. the underground storage facilities, in combination with its purchasing practices, enable lg&amp;e to offer natural gas sales service at competitive rates. at december 31, 2010, lg&amp;e had a 12 bcf inventory balance of natural gas stored underground valued at $60 million. a number of large commercial and industrial customers purchase their natural gas requirements directly from alternate suppliers for delivery through lg&amp;e's distribution system. these large commercial and industrial customers account for approximately 25% of lg&amp;e's annual throughput. natural gas supply lg&amp;e also has a portfolio of supply arrangements of various terms with a number of suppliers designed to meet its firm sales obligations. these natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. in tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. lg&amp;e purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. lg&amp;e has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by lg&amp;e between 2013 and 2018. total winter capacity under these contracts is 184,900 mmbtu/day and summer on-demand natural gas capacity is 60,000 mmbtu/day. lg&amp;e has a contract with the other pipeline that expires in 2012. total winter and summer capacity under this contract is 51,000 mmbtu/day. rates and regulation lg&amp;e and ku are subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc and the ferc in virtually all matters related to electric and natural gas utility regulation. in addition, ku is subject to the vscc and the tra. lg&amp;e and ku withdrew from the miso in 2006. since exiting from the miso, lg&amp;e and ku have been operating under a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff. lg&amp;e and ku now contract with the tennessee valley authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and southwest power pool, inc. to function as their independent transmission operator, pursuant to ferc requirements. certain operations of lke are subject to the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and comparable state statutes. lke is subject to certain ferc regulations as a holding comp any under puhca 2005 and the federal power act. lg&amp;e's and ku's kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and notes payable) including certain adjustments to exclude non-regulated investments and environmental compliance costs recovered separately through the environmental cost recovery (ecr) mechanism. as such, regulatory assets are generally earning a return. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms. ku's virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base. all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of virginia base rates. in january 2011, ku filed a notice of intent to file a rate case with the vscc for the test year ended december 31, 2010. the case is expected to be filed on or after april 1, 2011. ku's wholesale requirements rates for municipal customers are calculated based on annual updates to a rate formula that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms. 2010 kentucky rate case in january 2010, lg&amp;e and ku filed applications with the kpsc requesting increases in electric base rates of approximately 12%, or annual increases of $95 million and $135 million, respectively. in addition, lg&amp;e requested an increase in its natural gas base rates of approximately 8%, or $23 million annually. in june 2010, lg&amp;e and ku and certain intervenors agreed to a stipulation providing for increases in lg&amp;e's and ku's electric base rates of $74 million and $98 million on an annual basis, and lg&amp;e's natural gas base rates of $17 million on an annual basis, and those parties filed a request with the kpsc to approve such stipulation. in july 2010, the kpsc issued an order in the proceeding approving all the provisions of the stipulation, including a return on equity range of 9.75-10. 75%, with rates effective on and after august 1, 2010. virginia rate case in june 2009, ku filed an application with the vscc requesting an increase in electric base rates for its virginia jurisdictional customers in an amount of $12 million annually or approximately 21%. the proposed increase reflected a proposed rate of return on rate base of 8.586% based on a return of equity of 12%. as permitted pursuant to a vscc order, ku elected to implement the proposed rates effective november 1, 2009, on an interim basis. during december 2009, ku and the vscc staff agreed to a stipulation and recommendation authorizing a base rate revenue increase of $11 million annually and a return on rate base of 7.846% based on a 10.5% return on common equity. in march 2010, the vscc issued an order approving the stipulation, with the increased rates to be put into effect as of april 1, 2010. as part of the stipulation, ku refunded approximately $1 million in interim rate amounts in excess of the ultimate approved rates. ferc wholesale rate case in 2008, ku filed an application with the ferc for increases in electric base rates applicable to wholesale power sale contracts or interchange agreements involving, collectively, twelve kentucky municipalities. the application requested a shift from an all-in stated unit charge rate to an unbundled formula rate, including an annual adjustment mechanism. in 2009, the ferc issued an order approving a settlement among the parties in the case, incorporating increases of approximately 3% from prior rates and a return on equity of 11%. in may 2010, ku submitted to the ferc the proposed current annual adjustments to the formula rates, which incorporated certain proposed increases. updated rates, including certain further adjustments from a review process involving wholesale requirements customers, bec ame effective as of july 1,

(ppl and ppl energy supply) international regulated segment includes wpd, a regulated electricity distribution company in the u.k. wpd, headquartered in bristol, england, operates two of the 15 distribution networks providing electricity service in the u.k. through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. wpd (south west) serves 1.5 million end-users in a 5,560 square mile area of southwest england. wpd (south wales) serves 1.1 million end-users in a 4,550 square mile area within wales. details of revenue by category for the years ended december 31, are shown below. 2010 2009 2008 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue utility revenues $ 727 96 $ 684 96 $ 824 96 energy-related businesses 34 4 32 4 33 4 total $ 761 100 $ 716 100 $ 857 100 wpd's energy-related businesses revenues include ancillary activities that support the distribution business, including telecommunications and real estate. wpd's telecommunication subsidiary derives revenue from the rental of fiber optic cables primarily attached to wpd's overhead electricity distribution network. wpd also provides meter services to businesses across the u.k. franchise and licenses wpd is authorized by the u.k. government to provide electric distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. for instance, wpd is subject to governmental regulation of the prices it can charge and the quality of service it must provide, and wpd can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service. competition although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. wpd (south west) and wpd (south wales) are thus regulated monopolies which operate under regulatory price controls. rates and regulation the operations of wpd (south west) and wpd (south wales) are regulated under their distribution licenses under which income is generated subject to a price cap regulatory framework set by the regulatory body, ofgem, that provides economic incentives to minimize operating, capital and financing costs. the charges made for the use of the distribution networks are regulated on the basis of the "rpi plus/minus x" formula where rpi is a measure of inflation and x is an efficiency factor established by ofgem following their review. under the review, ofgem assesses the revenue and capital expenditure plans of companies and determines what they consider an efficient level of that expenditure. ofgem also considers the required cost of capital sufficient to encourage the required investment and determines customer ervice targets. in december 2009, ofgem completed its rate review for the period from april 1, 2010 through march 31, 2015. ofgem allowed wpd an average increase in total revenues, before inflationary adjustments, of 6.9% in each of the five years. the revenue increase includes reimbursement to electricity distributors for higher operating and capital costs to be incurred. also, ofgem set the weighted average cost of capital at 4.7%, which includes pre-tax debt and post-tax equity costs and excludes adjustments for inflation, for all distribution companies. this is a 0.8% decrease from the previous regulatory period. additionally, ofgem has established strong incentive mechanisms to provide significant opportunities to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability or customer service. in october 2010, ofgem announced a new pricing model that will be effective for the electricity distribution sector, inclu ding wpd, beginning april 2015. the model, known as riio (revenues = incentives + innovation + outputs), is intended to encourage investment in regulated infrastructure. key components of the model are: an extension of the price review period to eight years, increased emphasis on outputs and incentives, enhanced stakeholder engagement including network customers, a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation, expansion of the current low carbon network fund to stimulate innovation and continued use of a single weighted average cost of capital. customers the majority of wpd's revenue is derived from the delivery of electricity to end-users and thus its customers are the suppliers to those end-users. it is a requirement of ofgem that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the distribution connection and use of system agreement. this agreement sets out how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to provide collateral. (ppl and ppl electric) pennsylvania regulated segment includes the regulated electric delivery operations of ppl electric. ppl electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the puc, and certain of its transmission activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the federal power act. ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central pennsylvania. ppl electric also provides electricity supply in this territory as a plr. details of electric revenues by customer class for the years ended december 31, are shown below. 2010 2009 2008 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue residential $ 1,469 60 $ 1,473 45 $ 1,468 43 industrial 123 5 519 16 568 17 commercial 588 24 1,173 35 1,165 34 other (a) (b) 275 11 127 4 200 6 total $ 2,455 100 $ 3,292 100 $ 3,401 100 (a) includes regulatory over- or under-recovery reconciliation mechanisms, pole attachment revenues, street lighting and 2010 transmission revenues, net. (b) included in these amounts are $7 million, $74 million and $111 million of retail and wholesale electric to affiliate revenue which is eliminated in consolidation for ppl. franchise, licenses and other regulations ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies to which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. certain operations of ppl electric are subject to the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and comparable state statutes. competition pursuant to authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated transmission and distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electricity transmission and distribution businesses. rates and regulation transmission and distribution ppl electric's transmission facilities are within pjm, which operates the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. pjm serves as a ferc-approved rto to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. besides operating the electric transmission network, pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary objective of any rto is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the rto directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. ppl electric is entitled to fully recover from customers the charges that it pays to pjm for transmission-related services. in november 2004, pennsylvania enacted the alternative energy portfolio standard act (the aeps), which requires electric distribution companies and retail electric suppliers to ultimately provide 18% of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania from alternative energy sources by 2020. under this state law, alternative energy sources include hydro, wind, solar, waste coal, landfill methane and fuel cells. if an electric distribution company is unable to meet these targets, it will pay an alternative compliance payment of $45 (or, in the case of solar, 200% of the average market value of solar credits) for each mwh that it is short. ppl electric's initial compliance obligation covered the period january 1, 2010 to may 31, 2010. ppl electric was required to supply about 6.7% of the t otal amount of electricity it delivered to its plr customers from alternative energy sources during this period. under the puc-approved competitive bridge plan, ppl electric obtained full requirements service that included the generation or credits that ppl electric needed to comply with the aeps in 2010. aeps compliance requirements for june 1, 2010 through may 31, 2011 are about 9% of the total amount of electricity delivered to plr customers. act 129 became effective in october 2008. the law creates an energy efficiency and conservation program and smart metering technology requirements, establishes new plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and makes changes to the existing aeps. see "regulatory issues - pennsylvania activities" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129, other legislative and regulatory impacts and ppl electric's actions to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2009. plr the customer choice act requires electric distribution companies, including ppl electric, to act as a plr of electricity supply and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations established by the puc. as part of the puc final order, ppl electric agreed to supply this electricity at predetermined capped rates through 2009. to mitigate the risk that ppl electric would not be able to obtain adequate energy supply at the "capped" rates, ppl electric entered into full-requirement energy supply contracts with ppl energyplus sufficient for ppl electric to meet its plr obligation through the end of 2009. under these contracts, ppl energyplus supplied ppl electric's entire plr load at predetermined prices equal to the capped generation rates that ppl electric wa authorized to charge its customers. prior to the expiration of the rate caps, ppl electric's customers had limited incentive to purchase generation supply from other providers because, in recent years, the contracts between ppl electric and ppl energyplus provided a below-market price for these customers. as a result, a limited amount of "shopping" occurred. ppl electric's plr obligation after 2009 is governed by the puc pursuant to the public utility code as amended by act 129, plr regulations and a policy statement regarding interpretation and implementation of those regulations. effective january 1, 2010, ppl electric's cost of electric generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. the puc has approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period january 2011 through may 2013 which includes 14 solicitations for supply beginning january 1, 2011 with a portion extending beyond may 2013. pursuant to this plan, ppl electric had contracted for all of the 2010 electricity supply for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, large commercial and large industrial customers who elect to take that service in 2010. &#16 0;in addition, ppl electric completed two solicitations in 2009 and four solicitations in 2010 for supply starting january 2011 to may 2015. the solicitations include a mix of long-term and short-term purchases ranging from five months to five years to fulfill ppl electric's obligation to provide for customer supply as a plr. see "energy purchase commitments" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding ppl electric's solicitations for 2011 and its actions to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2011. in addition, several alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in ppl electric's service territory. whether its customers purchase supply from these alternative suppliers or from ppl electric as a plr, the purchase of such supply has no impact on the financial results of ppl electric. the cost to purchase plr supply is passed directly by ppl electric to its customers without markup. 2010 rate case in march 2010, ppl electric filed a request with the puc to increase distribution rates by approximately $115 million or approximately 2.4% over ppl electric's projected 2010 revenues, to be effective january 1, 2011. in december 2010, the puc approved a settlement filed by the parties that provides for a rate increase of $77.5 million, or 1.6%, over ppl electric's projected 2010 revenues. the approved rates became effective for service rendered on and after january 1, 2011. in january 2011, the pp&amp;l industrial customers alliance (pplica) filed a petition for reconsideration of the puc's order regarding pplica's proposal for a special rate schedule for certain large commercial and industrial customers. also in january 2011, the puc granted reconsideration for the purpose of evaluating the me rits of the petition. ppl electric cannot predict the outcome of this evaluation. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional information on rate mechanisms.

(ppl and ppl energy supply) supply segment owns and operates competitive domestic power plants to generate electricity; markets and trades this electricity and other purchased power to competitive wholesale and retail markets; and acquires and develops competitive domestic generation projects. consists primarily of the activities of ppl generation and ppl energyplus. ppl energy supply has generation assets that are located in the eastern and northwestern u.s. markets. the eastern generation assets are located in the northeast and mid-atlantic energy markets, including pjm and iso new england. ppl energy supply's northwestern generating capacity is located in montana. details of revenue by category for the years ended december 31, are shown below. 2010 2009 2008 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue electric and gas wholesale (a) $ 4,347 85 $ 4,761 90 $ 5,020 91 retail 415 8 152 3 151 2 trading 2 17 (121) (2) total electric and gas 4,764 93 4,930 93 5,050 91 energy-related businesses (b) 364 7 379 7 478 9 total $ 5,128 100 $ 5,309 100 $ 5,528 100 (a) included in these amounts are $320 million, $1,806 million and $1,826 million of wholesale electric sales to an affiliate which are eliminated in consolidation for ppl. (b) in addition to these amounts, ppl has $11 million, $12 million and $8 million of revenue which is not applicable to ppl energy supply. the supply segment's energy-related businesses revenues include activities that primarily support its generation, marketing and trading businesses. these activities include developing renewable energy projects and providing energy-related products and services to commercial and industrial customers, through its mechanical contracting and services subsidiaries. the renewable energy business builds, owns, operates and maintains renewable energy facilities throughout the mid-atlantic and northeast regions, and includes solar, wind and landfill gas to energy plants. at december 31, 2010, the renewable energy business owned and operated 33 mw of renewable capacity. the revenues of the mechanical contracting and services subsidiaries are included in "energy-related businesses" on the statements of inc ome. customer choice act in 1996, the customer choice act was enacted to restructure pennsylvania's electric utility industry in order to create retail access to a competitive market for generation of electricity. the customer choice act required each pennsylvania electric utility to file a restructuring plan to "unbundle" its rates into separate generation, transmission and distribution components and to permit its customers to directly access alternate suppliers of electricity. under the customer choice act, regulated utilities were required to act as a plr. as part of a settlement approved by the puc, ppl energyplus and ppl electric entered into full requirements energy supply agreements at predetermined "capped" rates through the end of 2009. with the expiration of the long-term power purchase agreements between ppl electric and ppl energyplus, ppl energyplus has multiple options as to how, and to whom, it sells the electricity produced by ppl energy supply's generation plants. these sales are based on prevailing market rates. the expiration of the long-term supply agreements with ppl electric also enables ppl energy supply to adjust its exposure to fluctuations in demand that existed with supplying ppl electric's plr load. entry of new generation suppliers into the pennsylvania marketplace provides ppl energy supply the opportunity to provide generation supply to additional wholesale customers but also exposes the supply segment to increased competition (see "competition" below). power supply ppl energy supply owned or controlled generating capacity (winter rating) of 11,729 mw at december 31, 2010. through subsidiaries, ppl generation owns and operates power plants in pennsylvania, montana, illinois and connecticut. generating capacity controlled by ppl generation and other ppl energy supply subsidiaries includes power obtained through ppl energyplus' tolling or power purchase agreements (including ironwood and other facilities that consist of nugs, wind farms and landfill gas facilities). see "item 2. properties - supply segment" for a complete listing of ppl energy supply's generating capacity. see note 9 to the financial statements for information on the 2010 sale of the long island generation business, consisting of plants in new york and the 2010 and 2009 sales of hydroelectric facilities located in maine. also, see note 9 to the financial statements for information on the anticipated sale of certain non-core generation facilities consisting of natural gas-fired facilities in wallingford, connecticut and university park, illinois and a ppl energy supply subsidiary's interest in safe harbor water power corporation, which owns a hydroelectric facility in conestoga, pennsylvania. ppl energy supply's generation subsidiaries are ewgs, which sell electricity into wholesale markets. ewgs are subject to regulation by the ferc, which has authorized these ewgs to sell the electricity generated at market-based prices. this electricity is sold to ppl energyplus under ferc-jurisdictional power purchase agreements. ppl susquehanna is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of the susquehanna nuclear units. certain of ppl energy supply's other subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of their fossil plants with respect to certain level and density monitoring devices. certain operations of ppl generation's subsidiaries are also subject to the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and comparable state statutes. the system capacity of ppl energy supply's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances. during 2010, ppl energy supply's power plants, excluding renewable facilities that are discussed separately below, generated the following amounts of electricity. state millions of kwh pennsylvania 48,140 montana 8,409 connecticut 220 new york (a) illinois 164 maine 75 total 57,008 (a) 15 million kwhs were excluded as tolling agreements were in place for 100% of the output. this generation represented a 4% increase above 2009 output. of this generation, 50% of the electricity generated was from coal-fired stations, 29% from the susquehanna nuclear station, 14% from oil/natural gas-fired stations and 7% from hydroelectric stations. substantially all of ppl energy supply's total expected generation in 2011 is anticipated to be used to meet its committed contractual sales. ppl energy supply has also entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for the years 2012 and beyond. these commitments are consistent with, and integral to, ppl energy supply's business strategy to capture profits while managing exposure to adverse movements in energy and fuel prices. see "commodity volumetric activity" in note 19 to the financial statements for the strategies ppl energy supply employs to optimize the value of its wholesale and retail energy portfolio. ppl energy supply subsidiaries own or control renewable energy projects located in pennsylvania, new jersey, vermont and new hampshire with a generating capacity (winter rating) of 33 mw. ppl energyplus sells the energy and recs produced by these plants to commercial, industrial and institutional customers. during 2010, the projects owned and operated by these ppl energy supply subsidiaries generated 154 million kwhs. ppl energyplus purchases the capacity, energy and recs from two wind farms in pennsylvania with a combined capacity of 50 mw. these contracts extend through 2027. see "item 2. properties - supply segment" for additional information regarding ppl generation's plans for capital projects in pennsylvania and montana that are expected to provide 247 mw of additional electric generating capacity by 2013. fuel supply ppl energyplus acts as agent for ppl generation to procure and optimize its various fuels. coal pennsylvania ppl energyplus actively manages ppl's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in central and northern appalachia. during 2010, ppl generation purchased 100% of the coal delivered to ppl generation's wholly owned pennsylvania stations under short-term and long-term contracts. these contracts provided ppl generation 7.0 million tons of coal. contracts currently in place are expected to provide 7.9 million tons of coal in 2011. the amount of coal in inventory varies from time to time depending on market conditions and plant operations. ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, has an agreement that provides more than one-third of ppl generation's projected annual coal needs for the pennsylvania power plants from 2011 through 2018. ppl generation has other contracts that, in total, will provide additional coal supply for their projected annual needs from 2011 through 2013. a ppl generation subsidiary owns a 12.34% interest in the keystone station and in keystone fuels, llc and a 16.25% interest in the conemaugh station and in conemaugh fuels, llc. the keystone station contracts with keystone fuels, llc for its coal requirements, which provided 4.5 million tons of coal to the keystone station in 2010. the conemaugh station requirements are purchased under contract from conemaugh fuels, llc, which provided 4.0 million tons of coal to the conemaugh station in 2010. all ppl generation pennsylvania coal stations have scrubbers installed. limestone is necessary to operate the scrubbers. acting as agent for ppl brunner island, llc and ppl montour, llc, ppl energyplus has entered into long-term contracts with limestone suppliers that will provide for those plants' limestone requirements through 2012. during 2010, 457,000 tons of limestone were delivered to brunner island and montour under long-term contracts. annual limestone requirements approximate 600,000 tons. montana ppl montana has a 50% leasehold interest in colstrip units 1 and 2, and a 30% leasehold interest in colstrip unit 3. northwestern owns a 30% leasehold interest in colstrip unit 4. ppl montana and northwestern have a sharing agreement to govern each party's responsibilities regarding the operation of colstrip units 3 and 4, and each party is responsible for 15% of the respective operating and construction costs, regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to colstrip unit 3 or 4. however, each party is responsible for its own fuel-related costs. ppl montana, along with the other owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined coal quality characteristics and specifications. ppl montana, along with the other owners, has a long-term purchase and supply agreement with the current supplier for units 1 and 2 which, provides these units 100% of their coal requirements through december 2014, and at least 85% of such requirements from january 2015 through december 2019. the coal supply contract for unit 3's requirements is in effect through december 2019. these units were built with scrubbers and ppl montana has entered into a long-term contract that commences in january 2011 through december 31, 2030, to purchase the lime requirements for these units. coal supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality characteristics and specifications for ppl montana's corette station. the contracts covered 100% of the station's coal requirements in 2010, and similar contracts are in place to supply 100% of the expected coal requirements through 2012. oil and natural gas pennsylvania ppl generation's martins creek units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas. during 2010, 100% of the physical gas requirements for the martins creek units were purchased on the spot market while oil requirements were supplied from inventory. at december 31, 2010, there were no long-term agreements for oil or natural gas for these units. short-term and long-term gas transportation contracts are in place for approximately 30% of the maximum daily requirements of the lower mt. bethel facility. during 2010, 100% of the physical gas requirements for lower mt. bethel were purchased on the spot market. in 2008, ppl energyplus acquired the rights to an existing long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of the ironwood facility. ppl energyplus has long-term transportation contracts to serve approximately 25% of ironwood's maximum daily requirements, which began in the fourth quarter of 2010. ironwood will be served through a combination of transportation capacity release transactions and delivered supply to the plant. ppl energyplus currently has no long-term physical supply agreements to purchase natural gas for ironwood. during 2010, 100% of the physical gas requirements for ironwood were purchased on the spot market. illinois at december 31, 2010, there were no long-term delivery or supply agreements to purchase natural gas for the university park facility. connecticut ppl energyplus has a long-term contract for approximately 40% of the expected pipeline transportation requirements of the wallingford facility, but has no long-term physical supply agreement to purchase natural gas. nuclear the nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. ppl susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services. these contracts are expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of 2016 and unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2017. ppl susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued operation of the nuclear units. federal law requires the u.s. government to provide for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel, but there is no definitive date by which a repository will be operational. as a result, it was necessary to expand susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity. to support this expansion, ppl susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage technology. the facility is modular, so that additional storage capacity can be added as needed. the facility began receiving spent nuclear fuel in 1999. ppl susquehanna estimates that there is sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approxi mately 2017 under current operating conditions. if necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be discharged through the current licensed life of the plant. in 1996, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled that the nuclear waste policy act imposed on the doe an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel on or before january 31, 1998. in 1997, the court ruled that the contracts between the utilities and the doe provide a potentially adequate remedy if the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by january 31, 1998. the doe did not, in fact, begin to accept spent nuclear fuel by that date. the doe continues to contest claims that its breach of contract resulted in recoverable damages. in january 2004, ppl susquehanna filed suit in the u.s. court of federal claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the doe's breach of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel. &# 160;discovery in the case has concluded but the court has not yet set a date for trial. ppl cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. energy marketing ppl energyplus sells the capacity and electricity produced by ppl generation subsidiaries, along with purchased power, ftrs, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances and recs in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets. ppl energyplus purchases and sells capacity and electricity at the wholesale level at competitive prices under ferc market-based prices. within the constraints of its hedging policy, ppl energyplus actively manages its portfolios of energy and energy-related products to optimize their value and to limit exposure to price fluctuations. ppl energyplus is licensed to provide retail electric supply to customers in delaware, maine, massachusetts, maryland, montana, new jersey and pennsylvania and provides retail natural gas supply to customers in pennsylvania, new jersey, delaware, and maryland. competition since the early 1990s, there has been increased competition in u.s. energy markets because of federal and state competitive market initiatives. while some states, such as pennsylvania and montana, have created a competitive market for electricity generation, other states continue to consider different types of regulatory initiatives concerning competition in the power and gas industry. some states that were considering creating competitive markets have slowed their plans or postponed further consideration. in addition, states that have created competitive markets have, from time to time, considered new market rules and re-regulation measures that could result in more limited opportunities for competitive energy suppliers. the activity around re-regulation, however, has slowed due to the current environment of declining power prices. as such, the competitive markets in which ppl and its subsidiaries participate are highly competitive. the supply segment faces competition in wholesale markets for available energy, capacity and ancillary services. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, congestion along the power grid, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. the supply segment primarily competes with other electricity suppliers based on its ability to aggregate generation supply at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. competitors in wholesale power markets include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators, competitive subsidiari es of regulated utilities and other energy marketers. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to supply segment" and ppl's and ppl energy supply's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview" for more information concerning the risks faced with respect to competitive energy markets. franchise and licenses see "background - segment information - supply segment - energy marketing" for a discussion of ppl energyplus' licenses in various states. ppl energyplus also has an export license from the doe to sell capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in canada. ppl susquehanna operates units 1 and 2 pursuant to nrc operating licenses that expire in 2042 for unit 1 and in 2044 for unit 2. in 2008, ppl susquehanna received nrc approval for its request to increase the generation capacity of the susquehanna nuclear plant. the project is being completed in phases over several years. ppl susquehanna's share of the total expected capacity increase is estimated to be 195 mw. the final phase of the unit 1 uprate was completed in 2010 and yielded 55 mw for ppl susquehanna. the final phase of the unit 2 uprate is scheduled for 2011 and is projected to yield an additional 50 mw for ppl susquehanna. ppl susquehanna's share of the expected remaining expenditures is $15 million. in 2008, a ppl subsidiary submitted a cola to the nrc for a new nuclear generating unit (bell bend) to be built adjacent to the susquehanna plant. also in 2008, the cola was accepted for review by the nrc. in february 2010, the nrc published its official review schedule that culminates with the issuance of bell bend's final safety evaluation report in 2012. see note 8 to financial statements for additional information. ppl holtwood operates the holtwood hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license that was recently extended by the ferc to expire in 2030. ppl holtwood operates the wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating station pursuant to a license renewed by the ferc in 2005 and expiring in 2044. ppl holtwood also owns one-third of the capital stock of safe harbor water power corporation (safe harbor), which holds a project license that extends operation of its hydroelectric generating station until 2030. the total capacity of the safe harbor generating station was 423 mw at december 31, 2010, and ppl holtwood is entitled by contract to one-third of the total capacity. in september 2010, ppl energy supply subsidiaries signed definitive agreements to sell their ownership interests in safe harbor and two other non-core generating facilities. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information. in october 2009, the ferc approved the request to expand the holtwood plant and extended the operating license through august 2030. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. the 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir in montana are licensed by the ferc. the ferc license for the mystic facility was relicensed, effective january 1, 2010, for an additional 40-year term. the thompson falls and kerr licenses expire in 2025 and 2035, respectively; and the licenses for the nine missouri-madison facilities expire in 2040. in connection with the relicensing of these generating facilities, applicable law permits the ferc to relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee, or allow the u.s. government to take over the facility. if the original licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on the kerr dam license. (ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric) seasonality the demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. as a result, ppl's, ppl energy supply's and ppl electric's operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned and the terms of contracts to purchase or sell electricity. financial condition see ppl's, ppl energy supply's and ppl electric's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for this information. capital expenditure requirements see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in ppl's, ppl energy supply's and ppl electric's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for the years 2011-2015. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures from environmental matters. environmental matters ppl and its subsidiaries are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. the epa is in the process of proposing and finalizing an unprecedented number of environmental regulations over the next few years that will directly affect the electric industry. these initiatives cover all sources - air, water and waste. see ppl's and ppl energy supply's "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources" in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" for information concerning environmental capital expenditures during 2010 and projected environmental capital expenditures fo r the years 2011-2015. also, see "environmental matters" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information. to comply with air related requirements, ppl's forecast for capital expenditures reflects a best estimate projection of expenditures that may be required within the next five years. such projections are a combined $2.1 billion for lg&amp;e and ku and $400 million for ppl energy supply. actual costs may be significantly lower or higher depending on the final requirements. environmental compliance costs incurred by lg&amp;e and ku are subject to recovery through a rate recovery mechanism. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional information. ppl and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities and operations and competitive positions. in complying with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including, among other things, air and water quality, ghg emissions, hazardous and solid waste management and disposal, and regulation of toxic substances, ppl's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain of their facilities. ppl's subsidiaries may also incur significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but could be significant. employee relations as of december 31, 2010, ppl and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees. ppl energy supply ppl generation 2,773 ppl energyplus (a) 1,923 ppl global (primarily wpd) 2,432 total ppl energy supply 7,128 ppl electric 2,293 lke 3,122 ppl services and other 1,266 total ppl 13,809 (a) includes labor union employees of mechanical contracting subsidiaries, whose numbers tend to fluctuate due to the nature of this business. approximately 5,800 employees, or 51%, of ppl's domestic workforce are members of labor unions, with four ibew locals representing approximately 4,300 employees. the bargaining agreement with the largest labor union, an ibew local, which expires in may 2014, covers approximately 1,600 ppl electric, 1,200 ppl energy supply and 400 other employees. approximately 830 employees of lke were represented by an ibew local and a united steelworkers of america (uswa) local. both lg&amp;e and ku have a three-year labor agreement with the ibew local. lg&amp;e's agreement expires in november 2011 and ku's agreement expires in august 2012. lke's agreement with the uswa expires in august 2011. ppl montana's largest bargaining unit, an ibew local, represents approximately 270 employees at the colstrip plant. the four-year labor agreement expires in april 2012. ppl montana's second largest bargaining unit, also an ibew local, represents approximately 85 employees at hydroelectric facilities and the corette plant. this four-year labor agreement expires in april 2012. approximately 1,870, or 77%, of ppl's u.k. workforce are members of labor unions. wpd recognizes four unions, the largest of which represents 40% of its union workforce. wpd's electricity business agreement, which covers approximately 1,820 union employees may be amended by agreement between wpd and the unions and is terminable with 12 months notice by either side. see "separation benefits" in note 13 to the financial statements for information on a 2009 cost reduction initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 200 domestic management and staff positions at ppl. available information ppl's internet website is www.pplweb.com. on the investor center page of that website, ppl provides access to all sec filings of ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec. additionally, ppl registrants' filings are available at the sec's website (www.sec.gov) and at the sec's public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, dc 20549, or by calling 1-800-sec-0330. item 1a. risk factors ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric face various risks associated with their businesses. while we have identified below the risks we currently consider material, these are not the only risks we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. in addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 15 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. as used in this item 1a., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to ppl energy supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the supply and international regulated segment discussions, or ppl electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania regulated segment discussion. risks related to all segments ( ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric ) we will selectively pursue growth of generation and transmission and distribution capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. we will pursue expansion of our generation and transmission and distribution capacity over the next several years through power uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the potential construction of new power plants, the potential acquisition of existing plants, the potential construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure. we will rigorously scrutinize opportunities to expand our generating capability and may determine not to proceed with any expansion. these types of projects involve numerous risks. any planned power uprates could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs. with respect to the construction of new plants, the acquisition of ex isting plants, or the construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. the success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory operating contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals. if we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project. furthermore, we might be unable to operate any new or acquired plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings. adverse conditions in the economic and financial markets in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. adverse conditions in the financial markets during 2008 and the associated contraction of liquidity in the wholesale energy markets contributed significantly to declines in wholesale energy prices, significantly impacting our earnings during the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009. the breadth and depth of these negative economic conditions had a wide-ranging impact on the u.s. and international business environment, including our businesses. as a result of the economic downturn, demand for energy commodities has declined significantly. this reduced demand will continue to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets we serve (such as pjm) and our pennsylvania and kentucky utility businesses, especially industrial customer demand. the combination of lower demand for power and natu ral gas and other fuels has put downward price pressure on wholesale energy markets in general, further impacting our energy marketing results. in general, current economic and commodity market conditions will continue to challenge predictability regarding our unhedged future energy margins, liquidity and overall financial condition. our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and capital, among other things, for capital expenditures and providing collateral to support hedging in our energy marketing business. global bank credit capacity declined and the cost of renewing or establishing new credit facilities increased significantly in 2008, primarily as a result of general credit concerns nationwide, thereby introducing uncertainties as to our businesses' ability to enter into long-term energy commitments or reliably estimate the longer-term cost and availability of credit. although bank credit conditions have improved since mid-2009, and we currently expect to have adequate access to needed credit and capital based on current conditions, deterioration in the financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. additionally, regulations to be adopted to implement the dodd-frank financial reform act of 2010 may impose requirements on our businesses and the businesses of others with whom we contract such as banks or other counterparties, or simply result in increased costs to conduct our business or access sources of capital and liquidity upon which the conduct of our businesses is dependent. our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of severe weather conditions. our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold weather or severe storms occur. the patterns of these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity. operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters. weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure or requiring significant repair costs. storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues or increase expenses, due to reduced usage and higher restoration charges. in addition, weather and other disturbances may affect capital markets and general economic conditions and impact future growth. our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change. climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation changes, and thus may impact consumer demand for electric power. temperature increases could result in increased overall electricity volumes or peaks and precipitation changes could result in altered availability of water for plant cooling operations. these or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. conversely, climate change could have a number of potential impacts tending to reduce demand. changes may entail more frequent or more intense storm activity, which, if severe, could temporarily disrupt regional economic conditions and adversely affect electricity demand levels. greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electric powe r, particularly power generated by fossil-fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on the regional economy. reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas --both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously low-cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered should consumers' preferences or market factors move toward favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electric usage generally. we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "legal matters," "regulatory issues" and in "environmental matters - domestic" in note 15 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. we could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our bond credit ratings or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets. in the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing means to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt interest or maturities and operating needs. as a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rate levels; credit rating considerations; insurance, security or collateral requirements; market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased liquidity to our domestic regulated utility businesses. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. credit ratings assigned by moody's, fitch and s&amp;p to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. although we do not expect these ratings to limit our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs or access new long-term debt, any ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs and access new long-term debt. see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - ratings triggers" for additional information on the impact of a downgrade in our credit rating. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting and reducing where possible our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. we provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contri bution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. we may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings. under gaap, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. although no goodwill impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2010, we are unable to predict whether future impairment charges may be necessary. we also review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. see notes 8, 9 and 18 to the financial statements for additional information on impairment charges taken during the reporting periods. we are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future years. we may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations. in connection with various divestitures, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities and with respect to certain transactions. these indemnities and guarantees relate to, among other things, liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated the divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture. we are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution businesses. the conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial effects, caused to or caused by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties. our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our financial performance. operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. these events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently or lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue or increased expense, including higher maintenance costs which may not be recoverable from customers. planned and unplanned outages at our power plants can require us to purchase pow er at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us fully in the event losses occur. we are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations. changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations. we are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, property, sales and use and employment-related taxes. we also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits. due to the revenue needs of the states and jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered. we cannot predict whether legislation or regulation will be introduced or enacted or the effect of any such changes on our businesses. if enacted, any changes could increase tax expense and could have a negative impact on ou r results of operations and cash flows. (ppl and ppl electric) risks related to domestic regulated utility operations our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to the kentucky regulated segment and the pennsylvania regulated segment. set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments. our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments. regulators may not approve the rates we request. we currently provide services to our utility customers at rates approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including those commissions referred to below. while such regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the rates that we may charge our regulated generation, transmission and distribution customers are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities. there can be no assurance that such regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments. while our rates are generally reg ulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. with respect to ppl's november 1, 2010 acquisition of lke, each of lg&amp;e and ku has agreed with the kpsc, subject to certain limited exceptions such as fuel and environmental cost recoveries, that no base rate increases would take effect for their kentucky retail customers before january 1, 2013. our regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will require rate increase requests to the regulators. if our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse affect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation. various federal and state entities, including but not limited to the ferc, the kpsc, the vscc, the tra and puc regulate many aspects of the domestic utility operations of ppl, including: the rates that we may charge and the terms and conditions of our service and operations; financial and capital structure matters; siting, construction and operation of facilities; mandatory reliability and safety standards and other standards of conduct; accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies; tax matters; affiliate restrictions; acquisition and disposal of utility assets and securities; and various other matters. such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties. in any rate-setting proceedings, federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our rate requests, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we seek. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. under the energy policy act of 2005, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are now subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the nerc and enforced by the ferc. compliance with reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures, and violations of these standards could result in substantial penalties which may not be recoverable from customers. changes in transmission and wholesale power market structures could increase costs or reduce revenues. wholesale revenues fluctuate with regional demand, fuel prices and contracted capacity. changes to transmission and wholesale power market structures and prices may occur in the future, are not estimable and may result in unforeseen effects on energy purchases and sales, transmission and related costs or revenues. these can include commercial or regulatory changes affecting power pools, exchanges or markets in which ppl participates. our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs. the domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of lke) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. the completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including: approval, licensing and permitting; land acquisition and the availability of suitable land; skilled labor or equipment shortages; construction problems or delays, including disputes with third party intervenors; increases in commodity prices or labor rates; contractor performance; environmental considerations and regulations; weather and geological issues; and political, labor and regulatory developments. failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators. risks specific to kentucky regulated segment ( ppl ) the costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are significant and are subject to continuing changes. extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to lg&amp;e's and ku's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, among other business related activities; and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be material. in addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures or other restrictions. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industr ial power users, and may impact the costs of their products or demand for our services. risks specific to pennsylvania regulated segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) we may be subject to higher transmission costs and other risks as a result of pjm's regional transmission expansion plan (rtep) process. pjm and the ferc have the authority to require upgrades or expansion of the regional transmission grid, which can result in substantial expenditures for transmission owners. as discussed in note 8 to the financial statements, we expect to make substantial expenditures to construct the susquehanna-roseland transmission line that pjm has determined is necessary for the reliability of the regional transmission grid. although the ferc has granted our request for incentive rate treatment of such facilities, we cannot be certain that all costs that we may incur will be recoverable. in addition, the date when these facilities will be in service, whether due to delays related to public opposition or other factors, is subject to the outcome of future events that are not all within our control. as a resul t, we cannot predict the ultimate financial or operational impact of this project or other rtep projects on ppl electric. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to pennsylvania conservation and energy efficiency programs. act 129 became effective in october 2008. this law created requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposed new plr electricity supply procurement rules, provided remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing alternative energy portfolio standard. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified dates (2011 and 2013). utilities not meeting these requirements of act 129 are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. although we expect to meet these requirements, numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. see "regul atory issues - energy policy act of 2005 - reliability standards" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information. cost recovery remains subject to political risks. although prior initiatives have not resulted in the enactment of such legislation, the possibility remains that certain pennsylvania legislators could introduce legislation to reinstate generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for pennsylvania utilities after the end of applicable transition periods, which in ppl electric's case was december 31, 2009. if such legislation were introduced and ultimately enacted, ppl electric could face severe financial consequences including operating losses and significant cash flow shortfalls. in addition, continuing uncertainty regarding ppl electric's ability to recover its market supply and other costs of operating its business could adversely affect its credit quality, financing costs and availability of credit facilities necessary to operate its b usiness. ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) risks related to international regulated segment our u.k. delivery business is subject to risks with respect to rate regulation and operational performance. our u.k. delivery business is rate regulated and operates under an incentive-based regulatory framework. in addition, its ability to manage operational risk is critical to its financial performance. disruption to the distribution network could reduce profitability both directly through the higher costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that ofgem has in place relating to customer service levels. in december 2009, ofgem completed its rate review for the five-year period from april 1, 2010 through march 31, 2015, thus reducing regulatory rate risk in the international regulated segment until the next rate review which will be effective april 1, 2015. the regulated income of the international regulated segment and also the rab are to some extent linked to movements in the retail price index (rpi). reductions in the rpi would adversely impact revenues and the debt/rab ratio. our u.k. distribution business exposes us to risks related to u.k. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and political conditions and policies of the u.k. government. these risks may reduce the results of operations from our u.k. distribution business. the acquisition, financing, development and operation of projects in the u.k. entail significant financial risks including: changes in laws or regulations relating to u.k. operations, including tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies; severe weather and natural disaster impacts on the electric sector and our assets; changes in labor relations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and in converting u.k. revenues to u.s. dollars, which can increase our expenses and/or impair our ability to meet such expenses, and difficulty moving funds out of the country in which the funds were earned; and compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws. risks related to supply segment ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) we face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. unlike our regulated utility businesses, our energy supply business is dependent on our ability to operate in a competitive environment and is not assured of any rate of return on capital investments through a predetermined rate structure. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. these competitive factors may negatively impact our ability to sell electricity and related products and services, as well as the prices that we may charge for such products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow our business. we sell our available energy and capacity into the competitive wholesale markets through contracts of varying duration. competition in the wholesale power markets occurs principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and availability. we believe that the commencement of commercial operation of new electric facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity and the evolution of demand side management resources will continue to increase competition in the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on the prices we receive for electricity. we also face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary services. we primarily compete with other electricity suppliers based on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. we also compete against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to credit sources, and our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. competitors in the wholesale power markets in which ppl generation subsidiaries and ppl energyplus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators and competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities. in the past, puhca significantly restricted mergers and acquisitions and other investments in the electric utility sector. entirely new competitors, including financial institutions, have entered the energy markets as a result of the repeal of puhca in 2006. the repeal of puhca also may lead to consolidation in our industry, resulting in competitors with significantly greater financial resources than we have. adverse changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. our energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power exceed our costs to supply power, are impacted by changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, recs, electricity transmission and related congestion charges and other costs. unlike most commodities, the limited ability to store electric power requires that it must be consumed at the time of production. as a result, wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable. among the factors that influence such prices are: supply and demand for electricity available from current or new generation resources; variable production costs, primarily fuel (and the associated fuel transportation costs) and emission allowance expense for the generation resources used to meet the demand for electricity; transmission capacity and service into, or out of, markets served; changes in the regulatory framework for wholesale power markets; liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, as well as general creditworthiness of key participants in the market; and weather and economic conditions impacting demand for electricity or the facilities necessary to deliver electricity. see exhibit 99(a) for more information concerning the market fluctuations in wholesale energy, fuel and emission allowance prices over the past five years. we do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price volatility. we attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity sales obligations by either reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and services through competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts. we also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements and other electricity-related commodities. however, based on economic and other considerations, we may decide not to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price risk. to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price risk, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. we are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale electricity markets. we purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based tariffs authorized by the ferc throughout the u.s. and also enter into short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price fluctuations. if we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay damages. these damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of any undelivered capacity or electricity. depending on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be significant. extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, environmental com pliance costs, transmission disruptions, and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and electricity. our power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post collateral for the benefit of our counterparties if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. we currently believe that we have sufficient credit to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these power contracts. our obligation to post collateral could exceed the amount of our facilities or our ability to increase our facilities could be limited by financial markets or other factors. see note 7 for a discussion of ppl's credit facilities. we also face credit risk that parties with whom we contract will default in their performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the time of contract. whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these risks using various means, including agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract price in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. however, there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance risk, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our obligations to other parties, which could in turn subject us to claims for damages. the load following contracts that ppl energyplus is awarded do not provide for specific levels of load and actual load significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy margins. we generally hedge our load following obligations with energy purchases from third parties, and to a lesser extent with our own generation. if the actual load is significantly lower than the expected load, we may be required to resell power at a lower price than was contracted for to supply the load obligation, resulting in a financial loss. alternatively, a significant increase in load could adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of the load following contracts to provide the energy necessary to fulfill increased demand at the contract price, which could be lower than the cost to procure additional energy on the open market. therefore, any significant decrease or increase in load compared to our forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial position. we may experience disruptions in our fuel supply, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our generation facilities. we purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. disruption in the delivery of fuel and other products consumed during the production of electricity (such as coal, natural gas, oil, water, uranium, lime, limestone and other chemicals), including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. our risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency and counterparty credit and non-performance risks may not work as planned, and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs. we actively manage the market risk inherent in our generation and energy marketing activities, as well as our debt, foreign currency and counterparty credit positions. we have implemented procedures to monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs, including independent validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, portfolio stress tests, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics. nonetheless, our risk management programs may not work as planned. for example, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management calculations. additionally, unforeseen market disruptions could decrea se market depth and liquidity, negatively impacting our ability to enter into new transactions. we enter into financial contracts to hedge commodity basis risk, and as a result are exposed to the risk that the correlation between delivery points could change with actual physical delivery. similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not designed to address. as a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events result in greater losses or costs than our risk models predict or greater volatility in our earnings and financial position. in addition, our trading, marketing and hedging activities are exposed to counterparty credit risk and market liquidity risk. we have adopted a credit risk management policy and program to evaluate counterparty credit risk. however, if counterparties fail to perform, the risk of which has increased due to the economic downturn, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices. in that event, our financial results are likely to be adversely affected. our costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital expenditures for pollution control improvements that, if delayed, would adversely affect our profitability and liquidity. our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection. to comply with existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control measures we may take, we have spent and expect to spend substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and compliance. in order to comply with existing and proposed federal and state environmental laws and regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-fired plants, in 2005 ppl began a program to install scrubbers and other pollution control equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxides with co-benefits for mercury emissions reduction). the cost to install this equipment was approximately $1.6 billion. the scrubbers at our montour and brunner island plants are now in service. many states and environmental groups have challenged certain federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict. as a result, it is possible that state and federal regulations will be adopted that would impose more stringent restrictions than are currently in effect, which could require us to significantly increase capital expenditures for additional pollution control equipment. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for our planned capital projects which are necessary to our business. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted, reduced or subjected to additional costs. furthermore, at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. for more information regarding environmental matters, including existing and proposed federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations to which we are subject, see "environmental matters - domestic" in note 15 to the financial statements. we rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control to deliver our wholesale electricity. if transmission is disrupted, or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver power may be hindered. we depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell in the wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric generation facilities. if transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by isos and rtos, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or we may be unable to sell products at the most favorable terms. the ferc has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that transmission capacity will not be available in the amounts we require. we cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether isos and rtos in applicable markets will efficiently operate transmission networks and provide related services. despite federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or prevent or delay operation of our facilities. our generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market. generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the ferc. the ferc has authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices. the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates. any reduction by the ferc in the rates we may receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations. see "ferc market-based rate authority" in note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the ferc's market-based rate authority program, and "pjm rpm litigation" in note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding the ferc's proceedings that could impact pjm's capacity pricing model. in addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals. if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to additional costs. if market deregulation is reversed or discontinued, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in some markets, state legislators, government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of these markets that have previously been competitive or permit electricity delivery companies to construct or acquire generating facilities. the isos that oversee the transmission systems in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address extremely high prices in the power markets. these types of price limitations and other mechanisms may reduce profits that our wholesale power marketing and trading business would have realized under competitive market conditions absent such limitations and mechanisms. although we generally expect electricity markets to continue to be competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our industry may be made, and legislative or other actions affecting the electric power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or reversed in states in which we currently, or may in the future, operate. see "new jersey capacity legislation" in note 15 to the financial statements. changes in technology may negatively impact the value of our power plants. a basic premise of our generation business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at relatively low prices. there are alternate technologies to produce electricity, most notably fuel cells, micro turbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells, the development of which has been expanded due to global climate change concerns. research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in alternate technologies. it is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternate methods of electricity production to a level that is equal to or below that of certain central station production. also, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by custome rs could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators. these alternative energy sources could result in a decline to the dispatch and capacity factors of our plants. as a result of all of these factors, the value of our generation facilities could be significantly reduced. we are subject to certain risks associated with nuclear generation, including the risk that our susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to increased security or safety requirements that would increase capital and operating expenditures, uncertainties regarding spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its licensed life. nuclear generation accounted for about 29% of our 2010 generation output. the risks of nuclear generation generally include: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. the licenses for our two nuclear units expire in 2042 and 2044. see note 21 to the financial statements for additional information on the aro related to the decommissioning. the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, including security, safety and employee-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. in the event of noncompliance, the nrc has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. in addition, revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital or operating expenditures at our susquehanna nuclear plant. there also remains substantial uncertainty regarding the temporary storage and permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel, which could result in substantial additional costs to ppl that cannot be predicted. in addition, although we have no reason t o anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our susquehanna plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational loss, damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. see note 15 to the financial statements for a discussion of nuclear insurance. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market

november 1, 2010 (date of acquisition) to december 31, 2010. those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for lke, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. in our opinion, based on our audits and, for 2010, the report of other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ppl corporation and subsidiaries at december 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2010, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as

of december 31, 2010, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (the coso criteria). ppl corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting at item 9a. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. as set forth in item 9a, management's report on internal control over financial reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of lg&amp;e and ku energy llc (lke), which is included in the 2010 consolidated financial statements of the company and constituted 32.6% and 47.3% of total assets and net assets, respectively, as of december 31, 2010 and 5.8% and 5.0% of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. our audit of internal control over financial reporting of ppl corporation and subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of lke. in our opinion, ppl corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2010, based on the coso criteria. we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated balance sheets of ppl corporation and subsidiaries as of december 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related

background ppl corporation , headquartered in allentown, pennsylvania, is an energy and utility holding company that was incorporated in 1994. through its subsidiaries, ppl generates electricity from power plants in the northeastern, northwestern and southeastern u.s.; markets wholesale or retail energy primarily in the northeastern and northwestern portions of the u.s.; delivers electricity to customers in pennsylvania, kentucky, virginia, tennessee and the u.k. and natural gas to customers in kentucky. in 2011 and 2010, ppl completed two acquisitions: on april 1, 2011, ppl, through its indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, ppl wem, completed its acquisition of all the outstanding ordinary share capital of central networks east plc and central networks limited, the sole owner of central networks west plc, together with certain other related assets and liabilities (collectively referred to as central networks and subsequently renamed wpd midlands), from subsidiaries of e.on ag. the consideration for the acquisition consisted of cash of $5.8 billion, including the repayment of $1.7 billion of affiliate indebtedness owed to subsidiaries of e.on ag and $800 million of long-term debt assumed through consolidation. wpd midlands operates two regulated distribution networks that serve five million end-users in the midlands area of england. on november 1, 2010, ppl acquired all of the limited liability company interests of e.on u.s. llc from a wholly owned subsidiary of e.on ag. upon completion of the acquisition, e.on u.s. llc was renamed lg&amp;e and ku energy llc (lke). lke is engaged in regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, lg&amp;e and ku. the consideration for the acquisition consisted of cash of $6.8 billion, including the repayment of $4.3 billion of affiliate indebtedness owed to subsidiaries of e.on ag, and $800 million of debt assumed through consolidation. see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information on both acquisitions. the acquisitions of wpd midlands and lke: (1) substantially reapportion the mix of ppl's regulated and competitive businesses by increasing the regulated portion of its business; (2) strengthen ppl's credit profile; and (3) enhance rate-regulated growth opportunities as the regulated businesses make investments to meet environmental compliance requirements and improve infrastructure and customer reliability. the investment in regulated assets also provides earnings stability through regulated returns and the ability to recover prudently incurred capital investments, in contrast to the competitive supply business where earnings and cash flows are subject to market conditions. at december 31, 2011, ppl had: $12.7 billion in operating revenues (including eight months from wpd midlands, which are recorded on a one-month lag) 10.5 million end-users of its utility services (including 5 million end-users served by the wpd midlands companies) approximately 19,000 mw of generation approximately 18,000 full-time employees in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its 100% membership interest in ppl global to its parent, ppl energy funding (the parent holding company of ppl energy supply and ppl global with no other material operations), to better align ppl's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements. the distribution separated the u.s.-based competitive energy marketing and supply business from the u.k.-based regulated electricity distribution business. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information. at december 31, 2011 ppl's principal subsidiaries are shown below (* denotes an sec registrant; lke, lg&amp;e and ku became sec registrants effective june 1, 2011): 3 in addition to ppl corporation, the other sec registrants included in this filing are: ppl energy supply, llc ,

electricity, primarily in the northeastern and northwestern power markets of the u.s. ppl energy supply's major operating subsidiaries are ppl energyplus and ppl generation. as noted above, in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its 100% membership interest in ppl global to its parent, ppl energy funding. for 2010 and 2009, the operating results of ppl global, which represents the international regulated segment, are classified as discontinued operations. at december 31, 2011, ppl energy supply owned or controlled 10,508 mw of electric power generation capacity and is implementing capital projects at certain of its existing generation facilities in pennsylvania and montana to provide 191 mw of additional generating capacity by the end of 2013. ppl electric utilities corporation , headquartered in allentown, pennsylvania, is a direct subsidiary of ppl incorporated in 1920 and a regulated public utility. ppl electric delivers electricity in its pennsylvania service territory and provides electricity supply to retail customers in that territory as a plr under the customer choice act. lg&amp;e and ku energy llc, headquartered in louisville, kentucky, is a holding company with regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, lg&amp;e and ku, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of ppl. lke, formed in 2003, is the successor to a kentucky entity incorporated in 1989. louisville gas and electric company, headquartered in louisville, kentucky, is a regulated utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. lg&amp;e was incorporated in kentucky in 1913. at december 31, 2011, lg&amp;e owned 3,352 mw of electric power generation capacity and, subject to certain regulatory approvals, is implementing capital projects at certain of its existing generation facilities to provide 483 mw of additional generating capacity by 2016. lg&amp;e also anticipates retiring 563 mw of generating capacity by the end of 2015 to meet certain environmental regulations. lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail native load. kentucky utilities company, headquartered in lexington, kentucky, is a regulated utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky, virginia and tennessee. ku was incorporated in kentucky in 1912 and virginia in 1991. ku serves its virginia customers under the old dominion power name while its kentucky and tennessee customers are served under the ku name. at december 31, 2011, ku owned 4,833 mw of electric power generation capacity and, subject to certain regulatory approvals, is implementing capital projects at certain of its existing generation facilities to provide 652 mw of additional generating capacity by 2016. ku also anticipates retiring 234 mw of generating capacity by the end of 2015 to meet certain environmental regulations. ku and lg&amp;e jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail native load. ppl's utility subsidiaries, and to a lesser extent, certain of its competitive supply subsidiaries, are subject to extensive regulation by the ferc including: wholesale sales of power and related transactions, electric transmission service, accounting practices, issuances and sales of securities, acquisitions and sales of utility properties and payments of dividends. ppl and lke are subject to certain ferc regulations as holding companies under puhca and the federal power act, 4 including with respect to accounting and record-keeping, inter-system sales of non-power goods and services and acquisitions of securities in, or mergers with, certain types of electric utility companies. successor and predecessor financial presentation (lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lke's, lg&amp;e's and ku's financial statements and related financial and operating data include the periods before and after ppl's acquisition of lke on november 1, 2010 and have been segregated to present pre-acquisition activity as the predecessor and post-acquisition activity as the successor. predecessor activity covers the time period prior to november 1, 2010. successor activity covers the time period after october 31, 2010. certain accounting and presentation methods were changed to acceptable alternatives to conform to ppl's accounting policies, and the cost bases of certain assets and liabilities were changed as of november 1, 2010 as a result of the application of push-down accounting. consequently, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the successor periods are not comparable to the predecessor periods; however, the core operations of lke, lg&amp;e and ku have not changed as a result of the acquisition. segment information (ppl) following the november 1, 2010 acquisition of lke, ppl is organized into four reportable segments: kentucky regulated, international regulated, pennsylvania regulated and supply. there were no changes to reportable segments in 2011. (ppl energy supply) in 2011, ppl energy supply operated in a single reportable segment. prior to 2011, ppl energy supply's segments consisted of supply and international regulated. in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its 100% membership interest in ppl global to its parent, ppl energy funding, to better align ppl's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements. for 2010 and 2009, the operating results of ppl global, which represent the international regulated segment, are classified as discontinued operations. (ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku each operate in a single reportable segment. (ppl and ppl energy supply) see note 2 to the financial statements for financial information about the segments and geographic financial data. kentucky regulated segment (ppl) consists of the operations of lke, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of lg&amp;e and ku. the kentucky regulated segment also includes interest expense related to the 2010 equity units that were issued to partially finance the acquisition of lke. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lke became a wholly owned subsidiary of ppl on november 1, 2010. lg&amp;e and ku are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky and, in ku's case, virginia and tennessee. lg&amp;e also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. lg&amp;e provides electric service to approximately 394,000 customers in louisville and adjacent areas in kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in 9 counties. lg&amp;e provides natural gas service to approximately 319,000 customers in its electric service area and 7 additional counties in kentucky. ku provides electric service to approximately 512,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western kentucky; approximately 29,000 customers in 5 counties in southwestern virginia; and fewer than 10 customers in tennessee, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. ku also sells wholesale electricity to 12 municipalities in kentucky under load following contracts. in virginia, ku operates under the name old dominion power company. 5 acquisition by ppl in september 2010, the kpsc approved a settlement agreement among ppl and all of the intervening parties to ppl's joint application to the kpsc for approval of its acquisition of ownership and control of lke. in the settlement agreement, the parties agreed that lg&amp;e and ku would commit that no base rate increases would take effect before january 1, 2013. the rate increases for lg&amp;e and ku that took effect on august 1, 2010 (as described below) are not impacted by the settlement. under the terms of the settlement, lg&amp;e and ku retain the right to seek approval for the deferral of "extraordinary and uncontrollable costs." interim rate adjustments will continue to be permissible during that period through existing fuel, environmental and demand side management recovery mechanisms. the agreement also substitutes an acquisition savings shared deferral mechanism for the previous commitment that lg&amp;e and ku file a synergies plan with the kpsc post-closing. this mechanism, which will be in place until the earlier of five years or the first day of the year in which a base rate increase becomes effective, permits lg&amp;e and ku to each earn up to a 10.75% return on equity. any earnings above a 10.75% return on equity will be shared with customers on a 50%/50% basis. the kpsc order and the settlement agreement contained a number of other commitments by lg&amp;e and ku with regard to operations, workforce, community involvement and other matters. in october 2010, both the vscc and the tra approved the transfer of control of lke to ppl. certain of these orders contained additional commitments with regard to operations, workforce, community involvement and other matters. also in october 2010, the ferc approved the application for the transfer of control of the utilities. the approval includes various conditional commitments, such as a continuation of certain existing undertakings with intervenors in prior cases, an agreement not to terminate certain ku municipal customer contracts prior to january 2017, an exclusion of any transaction-related costs from wholesale energy and tariff customer rates to the extent that lg&amp;e and ku have agreed not to seek recovery of the same transaction-related cost from retail customers and agreements to coordinate with intervenors in certain open or ongoing matters. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on regulatory matters related to the acquisition. franchises and licenses lg&amp;e and ku provide electric delivery service, and lg&amp;e provides natural gas distribution service, in their various service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. competition there are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of lke. neither the kentucky general assembly nor the kpsc has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in kentucky. the nature or timing of any legislative or regulatory actions regarding industry restructuring and their impact on lke, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation which implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. ku's operations in virginia have been and remain regulated. alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels provide indirect competition for natural gas revenues of lke. marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. lg&amp;e's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity; therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact profitability. however, some large industrial and commercial customers may physically bypass lg&amp;e's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems. in april 2010, the kpsc commenced a proceeding to investigate the regulatory, financial and operational aspects of natural gas retail competition programs and the potential benefits to kentucky consumers. a number of entities, including lg&amp;e, were parties to the proceeding. in december 2010, the kpsc issued an order in the proceeding declining to endorse natural gas competition at the retail level, noting the existence of a number of transition or oversight costs and an uncertain level of economic benefits in such programs. with respect to existing natural gas transportation programs available to large commercial or industrial users, the order indicates that the kpsc will review utilities' current tariff structures, user thresholds and other terms and conditions of such programs, as part of such utilities' next regular natural gas rate cases. 6 operating revenues lg&amp;e serves approximately 394,000 electricity customers, and its electric transmission and distribution system territory covers more than 700 square miles in 9 counties. ku serves approximately 541,000 electricity customers, and its transmission and distribution system territory covers more than 4,800 non-contiguous square miles in 82 counties. lg&amp;e purchases, transports, distributes or stores natural gas for approximately 319,000 customers in kentucky. lg&amp;e's natural gas service area covers more than 3,600 square miles in 16 counties. in 2011, 27% of lg&amp;e's annual natural gas throughput was purchased by large commercial and industrial customers directly from alternate suppliers for delivery through lg&amp;e's distribution system.

(b) includes intercompany power sales and transmission revenues, which are eliminated upon consolidation at lke. 7 (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) power supply at december 31, 2011, lke owned, controlled or had an ownership interest in generating capacity (summer rating) of 8,185 mw, of which 3,352 mw related to lg&amp;e and 4,833 mw related to ku, in kentucky, indiana, and ohio. see "item 2. properties - kentucky regulated segment" for a complete list of lke's generating facilities. the system capacity of lke's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances. during 2011, lke's power plants generated the following amounts of electricity. thousands of mwhs lke lg&amp;e ku fuel source southeastern midwestern southeastern midwestern southeastern midwestern coal (a) 33,897 1,132 15,291 783 18,606 349 oil / gas 497 175 322 hydro 290 208 82 total 34,684 1,132 15,674 783 19,010 349 overall total (b) 35,816 16,457 19,359 (a) the midwestern generation represents power generated by and purchased from ovec. (b) this generation represents a 1% increase for lke, a 7% decrease for lg&amp;e and an 8% increase for ku from 2010 output. a significant portion of lg&amp;e's and ku's generated electricity was used to supply its retail and municipal customer base. lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail native load. when lg&amp;e has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail native load and its generation cost is lower than that of ku, ku purchases electricity from lg&amp;e. when ku has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail native load and its generation cost is lower than that of lg&amp;e, lg&amp;e purchases electricity from ku. see "item 2. properties - kentucky regulated segment" for additional information regarding lg&amp;e's and ku's plans for capital projects, subject to certain regulatory approvals, that are expected to provide 483 mw and 652 mw of additional electric generating capacity by 2016. lg&amp;e and ku also anticipate retiring 563 mw and 234 mw of generating capacity by the end of 2015 to meet certain environmental regulations. fuel supply coal is expected to be the predominant fuel used by lg&amp;e and ku for baseload generation for the foreseeable future, with natural gas and oil being used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. lg&amp;e and ku have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2016 and normally augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases. for their existing units, lg&amp;e and ku expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western kentucky, southern indiana, southern illinois and ohio. the use of high sulfur coal will increase in 2012 due to the installation of scrubbers at ku's e.w. brown plant. in 2012 and beyond, lg&amp;e and ku may purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from wyoming for blending at tc2. coal is delivered to the generating plants by barge, truck and rail. 8 (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) natural gas supply five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 bcf, are used in providing natural gas service to lg&amp;e's firm sales customers. by using natural gas storage facilities, lg&amp;e avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads. natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. without this storage capacity, lg&amp;e would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are typically at their highest. several suppliers under contracts of varying duration provide competitively priced natural gas. at december 31, 2011, lg&amp;e had an 11 bcf inventory balance of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $53 million. lg&amp;e has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying terms with a number of suppliers designed to meet its firm sales obligations. these natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. in tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. lg&amp;e purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. lg&amp;e has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by lg&amp;e between 2013 and 2018. total winter capacity under these contracts is 195,000 mmbtu/day and summer capacity is 88,000 mmbtu/day. lg&amp;e has a contract with the other pipeline that expires in october 2012. total winter and summer capacity under this contract is 51,000 mmbtu/day during both seasons. that contract has been renegotiated through 2014 for a total capacity of 20,000 mmbtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons beginning in november 2012. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) rates and regulation lg&amp;e is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc and the ferc, and ku is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc, the ferc, the vscc and the tra. lg&amp;e and ku operate under a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff. lg&amp;e and ku contract with the tennessee valley authority, to act as their transmission reliability coordinator, and southwest power pool, inc. (spp), to function as their independent transmission operator, pursuant to ferc requirements. the contract with spp expires on august 31, 2012. lg&amp;e and ku have received ferc approval to transfer from spp to transerv international, inc. as their independent transmission operator beginning september 1, 2012. approval from the kpsc is also required, and an application requesting approval was filed in january 2012. lg&amp;e's and ku's kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and notes payable) including certain adjustments to exclude non-regulated investments and environmental compliance costs recovered separately through the ecr mechanism. as such, regulatory assets generally earn a return. ku's virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of virginia base rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. ku's rates to municipal customers for wholesale requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a rate formula that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms. kentucky rate case in january 2010, lg&amp;e and ku filed applications with the kpsc requesting increases in electric base rates of approximately 12%, or $95 million for lg&amp;e and $135 million for ku annually. in addition, lg&amp;e requested an increase in its natural gas base rates of approximately 8%, or $23 million annually. in june 2010, lg&amp;e and ku and all of the intervenors, except the attorney general, agreed to a stipulation providing for increases in lg&amp;e's electric base rates of $74 million annually, lg&amp;e's natural gas base rates of $17 million annually and ku's electric base rates of $98 million annually. all parties, except the attorney general, jointly filed a request with the kpsc to approve such stipulation. an order in the proceeding 9 was issued in july 2010, approving all of the provisions in the stipulation. the kpsc order determined a return on equity range of 9.75% to 10.75% to be reasonable and noted that the stipulation was within such range. the new rates became effective on august 1, 2010. (ppl, lke and ku) virginia rate case in april 2011, ku filed an application with the vscc requesting an increase in electric base rates for its virginia jurisdictional customers of $9 million annually, or 14%. in september 2011, a settlement stipulation was reached between ku and the vscc staff and filed with the vscc for consideration. in october 2011, the vscc approved the stipulation with two modifications that were accepted by ku. the vscc issued an order closing the proceeding in october 2011. the approved revenue increase was $7 million annually, based on a return on equity of 10.3%, with new base rates effective november 1, 2011. ferc wholesale rate case in september 2008, ku filed an application with the ferc for increases in electric base rates applicable to wholesale power sales contracts or interchange agreements involving, collectively, 12 kentucky municipalities. the application requested a shift from an all-in stated unit charge rate to an unbundled formula rate. this application was approved by the ferc, and annual adjustments are made to the rates charged to the kentucky municipalities with applications being submitted each may and revised rates taking effect on july 1. in may 2011, ku submitted to the ferc the annual adjustments to the formula rate which incorporated certain proposed decreases. these rates became effective as of july 1, 2011, with no issues raised by the wholesale requirements customers or the ferc. international regulated segment (ppl) includes wpd, a regulated electricity distribution company in the u.k. wpd, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, operates four of the 15 distribution networks providing electricity service in the u.k. with the april 2011 acquisition of wpd midlands, the total number of end-users served has more than doubled totaling 7.8 million across 21,585 square miles in wales, southwest and central england. see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information on the acquisition. details of revenue by category for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2011 2010 2009 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue utility revenues (a) $ 1,618 98 $ 727 96 $ 684 96 energy-related businesses 35 2 34 4 32 4 total $ 1,653 100 $ 761 100 $ 716 100 (a) the amounts for 2011 are not comparable to 2010 or 2009 as wpd midlands was acquired in april 2011. 2011 includes eight months of activity as wpd midlands' results are recorded on a one-month lag. wpd's energy-related businesses revenues include ancillary activities that support the distribution business, including telecommunications and real estate. wpd's telecommunication revenues are from the rental of fiber optic cables primarily attached to wpd's overhead electricity distribution network. wpd also provides meter services to businesses across the u.k. franchise and licenses wpd is authorized by ofgem to provide electric distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. for instance, wpd is subject to ofgem regulation of the prices it can charge and the quality of service it must provide, and wpd can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service. 10 competition although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. wpd's four distribution businesses, wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (west midlands) and wpd (east midlands), are thus regulated monopolies which operate under regulatory price controls. revenue and regulation the operations of wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands) are regulated by ofgem under the direction of the gas and electricity markets authority. the electricity act 1989 provides the fundamental legal framework of electricity companies and established licenses that required each of the distribution network operators (dnos) to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. ofgem has established a price control mechanism that restricts the amount of revenue that can be earned by regulated business and provides for an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for exceeding or underperforming against pre-established targets. this regulatory structure is an incentive-based regulatory structure in comparison to the u.s. utility businesses which operate under a cost-based regulatory framework. under the uk regulatory structure, electricity distribution revenues are currently set every five years, but extending to eight years in the next price control period beginning in april 2015. the revenue that dnos can earn in each of the five years is the sum of: i) the regulator's view of efficient operating costs, ii) a return on the capital from the rav plus an annual adjustment for the inflation determined by retail price index (rpi) for the prior calendar year, iii) a return of capital from the rav (i.e. depreciation), and iv) certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control. additionally, incentives are provided for a range of activities including exceeding certain reliability and customer service targets. wpd is currently operating under dpcr5 which was completed in december 2009 and is effective for the period from april 1, 2010 through march 31, 2015. ofgem allowed wpd (south west) and wpd (south wales) an average increase in total revenues, before inflationary adjustments, of 6.9% in each of the five years and wpd midlands an average increase in total revenues, before inflationary adjustments, of 4.5% in each of the five years. the revenue increase includes reimbursement for higher operating and capital costs to be incurred driven by additional requirements. in dpcr5, ofgem decoupled wpd's allowed revenue from volume delivered over the five-year price control period. however, in any fiscal period wpd's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a given period. any under recovery would be recovered in the next regulatory year, but would not be recorded as a receivable in the current period. any over recovery would be reflected in the current period as a liability and would not be included in revenue. in addition to providing a base revenue allowance, ofgem has established incentive mechanisms to provide significant opportunities to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. some of the more significant incentive mechanisms under dpcr5 include: interruptions incentive scheme (iis) - this incentive has two major components: 1) customer interruptions and 2) customer minutes lost and is designed to incentivize the dnos to invest and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages experienced by customers. the target for each dno is based on an average of the data from the prior price control period. beginning april 1, 2012, an additional customer satisfaction incentive mechanism will be implemented that will include a customer satisfaction survey, a complaints metric and a measure of stakeholder engagement. this incentive will replace the customer response telephone performance incentive that was effective april 1, 2010. line loss incentive - this incentive existed in the prior price control review and is designed to incentivize dnos to invest in lower loss equipment, to change the way they operate their systems to reduce losses, and to detect theft and unregistered meters. the targets for each of wpd's four dnos are set based on their performance during dpcr4. in dpcr5, ofgem introduced a two year lag in reporting losses to allow for all settlement data to be received. wpd has a $170 million liability recorded at december 31, 2011, calculated in accordance with an accepted methodology, related to the close-out of line losses for the prior price control period, dpcr4. ofgem is currently consulting on the methodology used to calculate the final line loss incentive/penalty for dpcr4. in october 2011, ofgem issued a consultation paper citing two potential changes to the methodology, both of which would result in a reduction of the liability; however, it is uncertain at this time whether any changes will be made. ofgem is expected to make a decision before the end of 2012. 11 information quality incentive (iqi) - the iqi is designed to incentivize the dnos to provide good quality information when they submit their business plans to ofgem during the price control process and to execute the plan they submitted. the iqi eliminates the distinction between capital expenditure and operating expense and instead looks at total expenditure. total expenditure is allocated 85% to "slow pot" which is added to rav and recovered over 20 years through the regulatory depreciation of the rav and 15% to "fast pot" which is recovered during the current price control review period. the iqi then provides for incentives or penalties at the end of dpcr5 based on the ratio of actual expenditures to the expenditures submitted to ofgem that were the basis for the revenues allowed during the five-year price control review period. at the beginning of dpcr5, wpd was awarded $301 million in incentive revenue of which $222 million will be included in revenue throughout the current price control period with the balance recovered over subsequent price control periods. additional incentive revenue primarily from the iis of $30 million related to performance for the regulatory year ended march 31, 2011 and will be included in revenues for the 2012-2013 regulatory year. in october 2010, ofgem announced a new pricing model that will be effective for the u.k. electricity distribution sector, including wpd, beginning april 2015. the model, known as riio (revenues = incentives + innovation + outputs), is intended to encourage investment in regulated infrastructure. key components of the model are: an extension of the price review period to eight years, increased emphasis on outputs and incentives, enhanced stakeholder engagement including network customers, a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation, expansion of the current low carbon network fund to stimulate innovation and continued use of a single weighted average cost of capital. ofgem has also indicated that the depreciation of the rav for rav additions after april 1, 2015 will change from 20 years to 45 years. at this time, management does not expect the effect of riio to be significant to wpd's financial results. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to international regulated segment." customers the majority of wpd's revenue is known as duos and is derived from charging energy suppliers for the delivery of electricity to end-users and thus its customers are the suppliers to those end-users. ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the distribution connection and use of system agreement. this agreement sets out how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to provide collateral. pennsylvania regulated segment (ppl) includes the regulated electric delivery operations of ppl electric. (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the puc, and certain of its transmission activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the federal power act. ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central pennsylvania. ppl electric also provides electricity supply in this territory as a plr. details of electric revenues by customer class for the years ended december 31, are shown below. 2011 2010 2009 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue residential $ 1,266 67 $ 1,469 60 $ 1,473 45 industrial 62 3 123 5 519 16 commercial 431 23 588 24 1,173 35 other (a) (b) 133 7 275 11 127 4 total $ 1,892 100 $ 2,455 100 $ 3,292 100 (a) includes regulatory over- or under-recovery reconciliation mechanisms, pole attachment revenues, street lighting and net transmission revenues. (b) included in these amounts for 2011, 2010 and 2009 are $11 million, $7 million and $74 million of retail and wholesale electric to affiliate revenue which is eliminated in consolidation for ppl. franchise, licenses and other regulations ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies to which it has succeeded and as a 12 result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. competition pursuant to authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated transmission and distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electricity transmission and distribution businesses. rates and regulation transmission and distribution ppl electric's transmission facilities are within pjm, which operates the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. pjm serves as a ferc-approved rto to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. in addition to operating the electric transmission network, pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary objective of any rto is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the rto directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. ppl electric is entitled to fully recover from customers the charges that it pays to pjm for transmission-related services. ppl electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a ferc tariff that allows recovery of transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update. ppl electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). in november 2004, pennsylvania enacted the alternative energy portfolio standard act (the aeps), which requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers, to obtain a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania from alternative energy sources. under the default service procurement plans approved by the puc, ppl electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the aeps. act 129 became effective in october 2008. the law creates an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new plr generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct, and changes to the existing aeps. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129, other legislative and regulatory impacts and ppl electric's actions to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2009. plr the customer choice act requires electric distribution companies, including ppl electric, to act as a plr of electricity supply and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by such companies pursuant to regulations established by the puc. as part of the puc final order, ppl electric agreed to supply this electricity at predetermined capped rates through 2009. to mitigate the risk that ppl electric would not be able to obtain adequate energy supply at the "capped" rates, ppl electric entered into full-requirement energy supply contracts with ppl energyplus sufficient for ppl electric to meet its plr obligation through the end of 2009. under these contracts, ppl energyplus supplied ppl electric's entire plr load at predetermined prices equal to the capped generation rates that ppl electric was authorized to charge its customers. prior to the expiration of the rate caps, ppl electric's customers had limited incentive to purchase generation supply from other providers because the contracts between ppl electric and ppl energyplus provided a below-market price for these customers. as a result, a limited amount of "shopping" occurred. since the expiration of the rate caps, shopping has increased and at december 31, 2011, the following percentages of ppl electric's customer load were shopping: 43% of residential, 82% of small commercial and industrial and 99% of large commercial and industrial customers. the puc continues to be interested in the competitive market for electricity. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. 13 ppl electric's plr obligation after 2009 is governed by the puc pursuant to the public utility code as amended by act 129, plr regulations and a policy statement regarding interpretation and implementation of those regulations. effective january 1, 2010, ppl electric's cost of electric generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. the puc has approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period january 2011 through may 2013, which includes 14 solicitations for supply beginning january 1, 2011 with a portion extending beyond may 2013. pursuant to this plan, ppl electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, large commercial and large industrial customers who elect to take that service from ppl electric. these solicitations include a mix of spot market purchases and long-term and short-term purchases ranging from five months to ten years to fulfill ppl electric's obligation to provide customer supply as a plr. to date, ppl electric has conducted ten of its 14 planned competitive solicitations. see "energy purchase commitments" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding ppl electric's solicitations for 2011 and its actions to provide default electricity supply for periods after 2011. in addition, alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in ppl electric's service territory. whether its customers purchase supply from these alternative suppliers or from ppl electric as a plr, the purchase of such supply has no impact on the financial results of ppl electric. the cost to purchase plr supply is passed directly by ppl electric to its customers without markup. 2010 rate case in march 2010, ppl electric filed a request with the puc to increase distribution rates by approximately $115 million or approximately 2.4% over ppl electric's projected 2010 revenues, to be effective january 1, 2011. in december 2010, the puc approved a settlement filed by the parties that provides for a rate increase of $77.5 million, or 1.6%, over ppl electric's projected 2010 revenues. the approved rates became effective for service rendered on and after january 1, 2011. in january 2011, the pp&amp;l industrial customers alliance (pplica) filed a petition for reconsideration of the puc's order regarding pplica's proposal for a special rate schedule for certain large commercial and industrial customers. the puc granted reconsideration and assigned the case to an administrative law judge. hearings were held in september 2011. in january 2012, the administrative law judge issued a recommended decision that the puc deny pplica's proposal. pplica filed exceptions to the recommended decision. ppl electric will file reply exceptions. ferc formula rates in march 2012, ppl electric plans to file a request with the ferc seeking recovery, over a 34-year period beginning in june 2012, of its unrecovered regulatory asset related to the deferred state tax liability that existed at the time of the transition from the flow-through treatment of state income taxes to full normalization. this change in tax treatment occurred in 2008 as a result of prior ferc initiatives which transferred regulatory jurisdiction of certain transmission assets from the puc to the ferc. a regulatory asset of $51 million related to this transition, classified as taxes recoverable through future rates, is included in "other noncurrent assets - regulatory assets" on the balance sheet. ppl electric believes recoverability of this regulatory asset is probable based on ferc precedent in similar cases; however, it is reasonably possible that the ferc may limit the recovery of all or part of the claimed asset. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on rate mechanisms. (ppl and ppl energy supply) supply segment owns and operates competitive domestic power plants to generate electricity; markets and trades this electricity, purchased power, and other energy-related products to competitive wholesale and retail markets; and acquires and develops competitive domestic generation projects. consists primarily of the activities of ppl generation and ppl energyplus. ppl energy supply has generation assets that are located in the northeastern and northwestern u.s. markets. the northeastern generating capacity is located primarily in pennsylvania within pjm and northwestern generating capacity is located in montana. ppl energy supply enters into energy and energy-related contracts to hedge the variability of expected cash flows associated with their generating units and marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes. ppl energyplus sells the electricity produced by ppl energy supply's generation plants based on prevailing market rates. details of revenue by category for the years ended december 31, are shown below. 14 2011 2010 2009 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue energy wholesale (a) $ 5,240 82 $ 4,347 85 $ 4,761 90 retail 727 11 415 8 152 3 trading (2) 2 17 total energy 5,965 93 4,764 93 4,930 93 energy-related businesses (b) 464 7 364 7 379 7 total $ 6,429 100 $ 5,128 100 $ 5,309 100 (a) included in these amounts for 2011, 2010, and 2009 are $26 million, $320 million and $1.8 billion of wholesale electric sales to an affiliate which are eliminated in consolidation for ppl. (b) energy-related businesses revenues include activities that primarily support the generation, marketing and trading businesses. these activities include developing renewable energy projects and providing energy-related products and services to commercial and industrial customers through its mechanical contracting and services subsidiaries. in addition to these amounts, for 2011, 2010, and 2009, ppl has $8 million, $11 million and $12 million of revenue which is not applicable to ppl energy supply. power supply ppl energy supply owned or controlled generating capacity (summer rating) of 10,508 mw at december 31, 2011. the system capacity of ppl energy supply's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances. generating capacity controlled by ppl generation and other ppl energy supply subsidiaries includes power obtained through ppl energyplus' tolling or power purchase agreements (including ironwood and other facilities that consist of nugs, wind farms and landfill gas facilities). see "item 2. properties - supply segment" for a complete listing of ppl energy supply's generating capacity. during 2011, ppl energy supply's power plants, excluding renewable facilities that are discussed separately below, generated the following amounts of electricity. thousands of mwhs fuel source northeastern northwestern total nuclear 15,627 15,627 oil / gas (a) 9,033 9,033 coal 21,612 3,842 25,454 hydro (a) 682 3,697 4,379 total (b) 46,954 7,539 54,493 (a) northeastern includes generation from certain non-core generation facilities that were sold in march 2011. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information. (b) this generation represents a 4% decrease from 2010 output, largely attributable to ppl susquehanna's dual-unit turbine blade replacement outages and economic reductions in coal unit output in the western u.s. in 2011. ppl energy supply's generation subsidiaries are ewgs that sell electricity into wholesale markets. ewgs are subject to regulation by the ferc, which has authorized these ewgs to sell the electricity generated at market-based prices. this electricity is sold to ppl energyplus under ferc-jurisdictional power purchase agreements. ppl susquehanna is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of the susquehanna nuclear units. certain of ppl energy supply's other subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of their fossil plants with respect to certain level and density monitoring devices. certain operations of ppl generation's subsidiaries are also subject to osha and comparable state statutes. see note 9 to the financial statements for information on the 2011 sale of certain non-core generation facilities consisting of natural gas-fired facilities in wallingford, connecticut and university park, illinois and an equity interest in safe harbor water power corporation, which owns a hydroelectric facility in conestoga, pennsylvania, the 2010 sale of the long island generation business, consisting of plants in new york and the 2010 and 2009 sales of hydroelectric facilities located in maine. substantially all of ppl energy supply's total expected generation in 2012 is anticipated to be used to meet its committed contractual sales. ppl energy supply has also entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for the years 2013 and beyond. ppl energyplus purchases the capacity, energy and recs from two wind farms in pennsylvania with a combined installed capacity of 50 mw. these contracts extend through 2027. 15 ppl energy supply subsidiaries own or control renewable energy projects located in pennsylvania, new jersey, vermont, connecticut and new hampshire with a generating capacity (summer rating) of 65 mw. ppl energyplus sells the energy, capacity and recs produced by these plants into the wholesale market as well as to commercial, industrial and institutional customers. during 2011, the projects owned and operated by these ppl energy supply subsidiaries generated 166,000 mwhs. see "item 2. properties - supply segment" for additional information regarding ppl generation's plans for capital projects in pennsylvania, montana, and new jersey that are expected to provide 191 mw of additional electric generating capacity by 2013. fuel supply ppl energyplus acts as agent for ppl generation to procure and optimize its various fuels. coal pennsylvania ppl energyplus actively manages ppl's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in central and northern appalachia. during 2011, ppl generation purchased 7.1 million tons of coal required for its wholly owned pennsylvania plants under short-term and long-term contracts. contracts currently in place are expected to provide 7.9 million tons of coal in 2012. the amount of coal in inventory varies from time to time depending on market conditions and plant operations. ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, has agreements in place that will provide more than 31 million tons of ppl generation's projected annual coal needs for the pennsylvania power plants from 2012 through 2018. a ppl generation subsidiary owns a 12.34% interest in the keystone plant and a 16.25% interest in the conemaugh plant. ppl generation owns a 12.34% interest in keystone fuels, llc and a 16.25% interest in conemaugh fuels, llc. the keystone plant contracts with keystone fuels, llc for its coal requirements, which provided 4.4 million tons of coal to the keystone plant in 2011. the conemaugh plant requirements are purchased under contract from conemaugh fuels, llc, which provided 4.5 million tons of coal to the conemaugh plant in 2011. all ppl generation pennsylvania coal plants have scrubbers installed. limestone is necessary to operate the scrubbers. acting as agent for ppl brunner island, llc and ppl montour, llc, ppl energyplus has entered into long-term contracts with limestone suppliers that will provide for those plants' limestone requirements through 2014. during 2011, 529,000 tons of limestone were delivered to brunner island and montour under long-term contracts. annual limestone requirements approximate 600,000 tons. montana ppl montana has a 50% leasehold interest in colstrip units 1 and 2, and a 30% leasehold interest in colstrip unit 3. northwestern owns a 30% leasehold interest in colstrip unit 4. ppl montana and northwestern have a sharing agreement to govern each party's responsibilities regarding the operation of colstrip units 3 and 4, and each party is responsible for 15% of the respective operating and construction costs, regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to colstrip unit 3 or 4. however, each party is responsible for its own fuel-related costs. ppl montana, along with the other owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined coal quality characteristics and specifications. ppl montana, along with the other owners, has a long-term purchase and supply agreement with the current supplier for units 1 and 2, which provides these units 100% of their coal requirements through december 2014, and at least 85% of such requirements from january 2015 through december 2019. the coal supply contract for unit 3's requirements is in effect through december 2019. these units were built with scrubbers and ppl montana has entered into a long-term contract to purchase the lime requirements for these units. the contract extends through december 2030. coal supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality characteristics and specifications for ppl montana's corette plant. the contracts covered 100% of the plant's coal requirements in 2011, and similar contracts are in place to supply 100% of the expected coal requirements through 2012. 16 oil and natural gas pennsylvania ppl generation's martins creek units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas. during 2011, 100% of the physical gas requirements for the martins creek units were purchased on the spot market while oil requirements were supplied from inventory. at december 31, 2011, there were no long-term agreements for oil or natural gas for these units. short-term and long-term gas transportation contracts are in place for approximately 38% of the maximum daily requirements of the lower mt. bethel facility. during 2011, 100% of the physical gas requirements for lower mt. bethel were purchased on the spot market. in 2008, ppl energyplus acquired the rights to an existing long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of the ironwood facility. ppl energyplus has long-term transportation contracts to serve approximately 25% of ironwood's maximum daily requirements, which began in the fourth quarter of 2010. ironwood will be served through a combination of transportation capacity release transactions and delivered supply to the plant. ppl energyplus currently has no long-term physical supply agreements to purchase natural gas for ironwood. during 2011, 100% of the physical gas requirements for ironwood were purchased on the spot market. nuclear the nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. ppl susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services. these contracts are expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of 2016 and unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2017. ppl susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued operation of the nuclear units. federal law requires the u.s. government to provide for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel, but there is no definitive date by which a repository will be operational. as a result, it was necessary to expand susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity. to support this expansion, ppl susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage technology. the facility is modular, so that additional storage capacity can be added as needed. the facility began receiving spent nuclear fuel in 1999. ppl susquehanna estimates that there is sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approximately 2017 under current operating conditions. if necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be discharged through the current licensed life of the plant. in 1996, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit (d.c. circuit court) ruled that the nuclear waste policy act imposed on the doe an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel on or before january 31, 1998. in 1997, the d.c. circuit court ruled that the contracts between the utilities and the doe provide a potentially adequate remedy if the doe failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by january 31, 1998. the doe did not, in fact, begin to accept spent nuclear fuel by that date. the doe continues to contest claims that its breach of contract resulted in recoverable damages. in january 2004, ppl susquehanna filed suit in the u.s. court of federal claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the doe's breach of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel. in may 2011, the parties entered into a settlement agreement which resolved all claims of ppl susquehanna through december 2013. under the settlement agreement, ppl susquehanna received $50 million for its share of claims to recover costs to store spent nuclear fuel at the susquehanna plant through september 30, 2009, and recognized a credit to "fuel" expense in the statement of income in the second quarter of 2011. ppl susquehanna also will be eligible to receive payment of annual claims for allowed costs, as set forth in the settlement agreement, that are incurred thereafter through the december 31, 2013 termination date of the settlement agreement. in exchange, ppl susquehanna has waived any claims against the united states government for costs paid or injuries sustained related to storing spent nuclear fuel at the susquehanna plant through december 31, 2013. 17 energy marketing ppl energyplus sells the capacity and electricity produced by ppl generation subsidiaries, along with purchased power, ftrs, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances and recs in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets. purchases and sales at the wholesale level are made at competitive prices under ferc market-based prices. ppl energyplus is licensed to provide retail electric supply to customers in delaware, maryland, montana, new jersey and pennsylvania and provides retail natural gas supply to customers in pennsylvania, new jersey, delaware and maryland. within the constraints of its hedging policy, ppl energyplus actively manages its portfolios of energy and energy-related products to optimize their value and to limit exposure to price fluctuations. see "commodity volumetric activity" in note 19 to the financial statements for the strategies ppl energy supply employs to optimize the value of its wholesale and retail energy portfolio. competition since the early 1990s, there has been increased competition in u.s. energy markets because of federal and state competitive market initiatives. while some states, such as pennsylvania and montana, have created a competitive market for electricity generation, other states continue to consider different types of regulatory initiatives concerning competition in the power and gas industry. some states that were considering creating competitive markets have slowed their plans or postponed further consideration. in addition, states that have created competitive markets have, from time to time, considered new market rules and re-regulation measures that could result in more limited opportunities for competitive energy suppliers. the activity around re-regulation, however, has slowed due to the current environment of declining power prices. as such, the markets in which ppl energy supply participates are highly competitive. ppl energy supply faces competition in wholesale markets for available energy, capacity and ancillary services. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, congestion along the power grid, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. ppl energy supply primarily competes with other electricity suppliers based on its ability to aggregate generation supply at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. competitors in wholesale power markets include regulated utilities, industrial companies, nugs, competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy marketers. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to supply segment" and ppl's and ppl energy supply's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview" for more information concerning the risks faced with respect to competitive energy markets. franchise and licenses see "energy marketing" above for a discussion of ppl energyplus' licenses in various states. ppl energyplus also has an export license from the doe to sell capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in canada. ppl susquehanna operates units 1 and 2 pursuant to nrc operating licenses that expire in 2042 for unit 1 and in 2044 for unit 2. in 2008, a ppl energy supply subsidiary, ppl bell bend, llc, submitted a cola to the nrc for a new nuclear generating unit (bell bend) to be built adjacent to the susquehanna plant. also in 2008, the cola was accepted for review by the nrc. ppl bell bend, llc does not expect the nrc review of the bell bend project to be completed prior to 2014. see note 8 to financial statements for additional information. ppl holtwood operates the holtwood hydroelectric generating plant pursuant to a ferc-granted license that expires in 2030. in october 2009, the ferc approved the request to expand the holtwood plant. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. ppl holtwood operates the wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating plant pursuant to a ferc-granted license that expires in 2044. in 2010, ppl holtwood owned one-third of the capital stock of safe harbor water power corporation (safe harbor), which held a project license that would extend operation of its hydroelectric generating plant until 2030. in march 2011, ppl energy supply subsidiaries completed the sale of their ownership interests in safe harbor and two other non-core generating facilities. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information. 18 the 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir in montana are licensed by the ferc. the thompson falls and kerr licenses expire in 2025 and 2035, the licenses for the nine missouri-madison facilities expire in 2040, and the license for the mystic facility expires in 2050. in connection with the relicensing of these generating facilities, applicable law permits the ferc to relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee or allow the u.s. government to take over the facility. if the original licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on the kerr dam license. (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) seasonality the demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. as a result, the registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned and the terms of contracts to purchase or sell electricity. financial condition see the registrant's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for this information. capital expenditure requirements see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in the registrants' "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for 2012 through 2016. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures from environmental matters. environmental matters the registrants are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. the epa is in the process of proposing and finalizing an unprecedented number of environmental regulations that will directly affect the electric industry. these initiatives cover air, water and waste. see ppl's, ppl energy supply's, lke's, lg&amp;e's and ku's "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources" in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" for information concerning environmental capital expenditures during 2011 and projected environmental capital expenditures for the years 2012-2016. also, see "environmental matters" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information. to comply with primarily air-related environmental requirements, ppl's forecast for capital expenditures reflects a best estimate projection of expenditures that may be required within the next five years. such projections are $1.6 billion for lg&amp;e, $1.5 billion for ku and $130 million for ppl energy supply. actual costs (including capital, allowance purchases and operational modifications) may be significantly lower or higher depending on the final requirements and market conditions. environmental compliance costs incurred by lg&amp;e and ku are subject to recovery through a rate recovery mechanism. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. the registrants are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities and operations and competitive positions. in complying with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including, among other things, air and water quality, ghg emissions, hazardous and solid waste management and disposal, and regulation of toxic substances, ppl's and lke's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain of their facilities. ppl's and lke's subsidiaries may also incur significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable, but could be significant. employee relations at december 31, 2011, ppl and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees. 19 ppl energy supply ppl generation 2,812 ppl energyplus (a) 1,864

union employees of mechanical contracting subsidiaries, whose numbers tend to fluctuate due to the nature of this business. approximately 5,600 employees, or 49%, of ppl's domestic workforce are members of labor unions, with four international brotherhood of electrical workers (ibew) labor unions representing approximately 4,300 employees. the bargaining agreement with the largest ibew labor union, which expires in may 2014, covers approximately 1,500 ppl electric, 1,600 ppl energy supply and 400 other employees. approximately 700 employees of lg&amp;e and 70 employees of ku are represented by an ibew labor union. both lg&amp;e and ku have three-year labor agreements with the ibew, which expire in november 2014 and august 2012. ku's agreement includes annual wage reopeners. approximately 80 employees of ku are represented by a united steelworkers of america (uswa) labor union. ku and the uswa have agreed in principle on a labor agreement effective through august 2014, which was ratified by the members in february 2012. ppl montana's largest bargaining unit, an ibew labor union, represents approximately 270 employees at the colstrip plant. the four-year labor agreement expires in april 2012. ppl montana's second largest bargaining unit, also an ibew labor union, represents approximately 80 employees at hydroelectric facilities and the corette plant. in 2011, this four-year labor agreement was extended one year and expires in april 2013. approximately 4,100 or 65%, of ppl's u.k. workforce are members of labor unions. wpd recognizes four unions, the largest of which represents 26% of its union workforce. wpd's electricity business agreement, which covers approximately 4,000 union employees, may be amended by agreement between wpd and the unions and is terminable with 12 months notice by either side. see "separation benefits - international regulated segment" in note 10 to the financial statements for information on a 2011 reorganization designed to transition the wpd midlands companies to the same operating structure as wpd (south west) and wpd (south wales). see "separation benefits" in note 13 to the financial statements for information on a 2009 cost reduction initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 200 domestic management and staff positions at ppl. available information ppl's internet website is www.pplweb.com. on the investor center page of that website, ppl provides access to all sec filings of the registrants (including annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(d) or 15(d)) free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec. additionally, the registrants' filings are available at the sec's website (www.sec.gov) and at the sec's public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, dc 20549, or by calling 1-800-sec-0330. 20 item 1a. risk factors the registrants face various risks associated with their businesses. our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. in addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 15 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. as used in this item 1a., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to ppl energy supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the supply segment discussions, or ppl electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania regulated segment discussion, or lke and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the kentucky regulated segment discussion. risks related to all segments ( ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku ) we plan to selectively pursue growth of generation, transmission and distribution capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. we plan to pursue expansion of our generation, transmission and distribution capacity over the next several years through power uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the potential construction of new power plants, the potential acquisition of existing plants, the potential construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure. we will rigorously scrutinize opportunities to expand our generating capability and may determine not to proceed with any expansion. these types of projects involve numerous risks. any planned power uprates could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs. with respect to the construction of new plants, the acquisition of existing plants, or the construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. expansion in our regulated businesses is dependent on future load or service requirements and subject to applicable regulatory processes. the success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory operating contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals. if we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project. furthermore, we might be unable to operate any new or acquired plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings. adverse conditions in the economic and financial markets in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. adverse conditions in the financial markets during 2008 and the associated contraction of liquidity in the wholesale energy markets contributed significantly to declines in wholesale energy prices, significantly impacting our earnings during the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009. the breadth and depth of these negative economic conditions had a wide-ranging impact on the u.s. and international business environment, including our businesses. as a result of the economic downturn, demand for energy commodities has declined significantly. this reduced demand will continue to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets we serve (such as pjm) and our pennsylvania and kentucky utility businesses. the combination of lower demand for power and natural gas and other fuels has put downward price pressure on wholesale energy markets in general, further impacting our energy marketing results. in general, current economic and commodity market conditions will continue to challenge predictability regarding our unhedged future energy margins, liquidity and overall financial condition. our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and capital, among other things, for capital expenditures and providing collateral to support hedging in our energy marketing business. global bank credit capacity declined and the cost of renewing or establishing new credit facilities increased significantly in 2008, primarily as a result of general credit concerns nationwide, thereby introducing uncertainties as to our businesses' ability to enter into long-term energy commitments or reliably estimate the longer-term cost and availability of credit. although bank credit conditions have improved since mid-2009, and we currently expect to have adequate access to needed credit and capital based on current conditions, deterioration in the financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. additionally, regulations to be adopted to implement the dodd-frank act may impose requirements on our businesses and the businesses of others with whom we 21 contract such as banks or other counterparties, or simply result in increased costs to conduct our business or access sources of capital and liquidity upon which the conduct of our businesses is dependent. our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of extreme weather conditions. our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold, unseasonably mild weather or severe storms occur. the patterns of these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity. operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters. weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs. storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues or increase expenses, due to reduced usage and higher restoration charges. in addition, weather and other disturbances may affect capital markets and general economic conditions and impact future growth. our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change. climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electric power. temperature increases could result in increased overall electricity consumption or peaks and precipitation changes could result in altered availability of water for hydro generation or plant cooling operations. these or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electric power, particularly power generated by fossil-fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies. reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered should consumers' preferences or market factors move toward favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electric usage generally. we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "legal matters," "regulatory issues" and "environmental matters - domestic" in note 15 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. we could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our bond credit ratings or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets. in the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing means to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt interest or maturities and operating needs. as a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rate levels; credit rating considerations; insurance, security or collateral requirements; market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased liquidity to our regulated utility businesses. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. credit ratings assigned by moody's, fitch and s&amp;p to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. although we do not expect these ratings to limit our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs or access new long-term debt, any ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs and access new long-term debt. see "item 7. management's 22 discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - ratings triggers" for additional information on the impact of a downgrade in our credit rating. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting and reducing where possible our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. we provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. we may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings. under gaap, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. although no goodwill impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2011, we are unable to predict whether future impairment charges may be necessary. we also review our long-lived assets, including equity investments, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. see notes 9 and 18 to the financial statements for additional information on impairment charges taken during the reporting periods. we are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future years. we may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations. in connection with various divestitures, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities and with respect to certain transactions. these indemnities and guarantees relate to, among other things, liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated the divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture. we are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution businesses. the conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or caused by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties. our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse effect on our financial performance. operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. these events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently or lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue or increased expense, including higher maintenance costs which may not be recoverable from customers. planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. 23 although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us fully in the event losses occur. the operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risk. numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. the operation of our generation plants, including the susquehanna nuclear plant, and of our energy and fuel trading businesses, as well as our transmission and distribution operations are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive actions, principally by terrorists or vandals, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. as a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages and costs to replace or repair damaged equipment. we are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations. changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations. we are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, property, sales and use and employment-related taxes. we also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits. due to the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered. we cannot predict whether such tax legislation or regulation will be introduced or enacted or the effect of any such changes on our businesses. if enacted, any changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we are subject to the risk that our workforce and its knowledge base may become depleted in coming years. ppl is experiencing an increase in attrition due primarily to the number of retiring employees. over the next five years, 38% of ppl's workforce is projected to leave the company, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed personnel due to a declining trend in the number of available workers and an increase in competition for such workers. (ppl, ppl energy supply and lke) risk related to registrant holding companies ppl's, ppl energy supply's and lke's cash flows and ability to meet their obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and ppl's ability to pay dividends, largely depends on the financial performance of their subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries. ppl, ppl energy supply and lke are holding companies and conduct their operations primarily through subsidiaries. substantially all of the consolidated assets of these registrants are held by such subsidiaries. accordingly, their cash flows and ability to meet their debt and guaranty obligations, as well as ppl's ability to pay dividends, are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or advances or repayment of loans and advances. the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due from their parents or to make any funds available for such a payment. the ability of the subsidiaries of the registrants to pay dividends or distributions to such registrants in the future will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory requirements, including restrictions on the ability of ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku to pay dividends under section 305(a) of the federal power act. because ppl, ppl energy supply and lke are holding companies, their debt and guaranty obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of their subsidiaries. therefore, ppl's, ppl energy supply's and lke's rights and the rights of their creditors, including rights of any debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of their subsidiaries, in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors. although certain agreements to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, ppl, ppl energy supply and lke and their subsidiaries retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities. in addition, if ppl elects to receive distributions of earnings from its foreign 24 operations, ppl may incur u.s. income taxes, net of any available foreign tax credits, on such amounts. distributions to ppl from its international projects are, in some countries, also subject to withholding taxes. (ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) risks related to domestic regulated utility operations our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to the kentucky regulated segment and the pennsylvania regulated segment. set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments. our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments. regulators may not approve the rates we request. we currently provide services to our utility customers at rates approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including those commissions referred to below. while such regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the rates that we may charge our regulated generation, transmission and distribution customers are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities. there can be no assurance that such regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments. while our rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. with respect to ppl's november 1, 2010 acquisition of lke, each of lg&amp;e and ku has agreed with the kpsc, subject to certain limited exceptions such as fuel and environmental cost recoveries, that no base rate increases would take effect for their kentucky retail customers before january 1, 2013. our regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will require rate increase requests to the regulators. if our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse affect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation. various federal and state entities, including but not limited to the ferc, kpsc, vscc, tra and puc regulate many aspects of the domestic utility operations of ppl, including: the rates that we may charge and the terms and conditions of our service and operations; financial and capital structure matters; siting, construction and operation of facilities; mandatory reliability and safety standards and other standards of conduct; accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies; tax matters; affiliate restrictions; acquisition and disposal of utility assets and securities; and various other matters. such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties. in any rate-setting proceedings, federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our rate requests, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we seek. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. under the energy policy act of 2005, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are now subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the nerc and enforced by the ferc. compliance with reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures, and violations of these standards could result in substantial penalties which may not be recoverable from customers. changes in transmission and wholesale power market structures could increase costs or reduce revenues. wholesale revenues fluctuate with regional demand, fuel prices and contracted capacity. changes to transmission and wholesale power market structures and prices may occur in the future, are not predictable and may result in unforeseen 25 effects on energy purchases and sales, transmission and related costs or revenues. these can include commercial or regulatory changes affecting power pools, exchanges or markets in which ppl participates. our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs. the domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of lg&amp;e and ku) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. the completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including: approval, licensing and permitting; land acquisition and the availability of suitable land; skilled labor or equipment shortages; construction problems or delays, including disputes with third party intervenors; increases in commodity prices or labor rates; contractor performance; environmental considerations and regulations; weather and geological issues; and political, labor and regulatory developments. failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators. risks specific to kentucky regulated segment ( ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku ) the costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are significant and are subject to continuing changes. extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to lg&amp;e's and ku's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, among other business-related activities; and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted but could be material. in addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures or other restrictions. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products or demand for our services. on-going changes in environmental regulations or their implementation requirements and our compliance strategies relating thereto entail a number of uncertainties. the environmental standards governing lg&amp;e's and ku's businesses, particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to ongoing rulemakings and other regulatory developments, legislative activities, and litigation. the uncertainties associated with these developments introduce risks to our management of operations and regulatory compliance. environmental developments, including revisions to applicable standards, changes in compliance deadlines, and invalidation of rules on appeal may require major changes in compliance strategies, operations or assets or adjustments to prior plans. depending on the extent, frequency and timing of such changes, the companies may be subject to inconsistent requirements under multiple regulatory programs, compressed windows for decision-making and short compliance deadlines that may require aggressive schedules for construction, permitting, and other regulatory approvals. under such circumstances, the companies may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, or increased costs of implementation. 26 risks specific to pennsylvania regulated segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) we may be subject to higher transmission costs and other risks as a result of pjm's regional transmission expansion plan (rtep) process. pjm and the ferc have the authority to require upgrades or expansion of the regional transmission grid, which can result in substantial expenditures for transmission owners. as discussed in note 8 to the financial statements, we expect to make substantial expenditures to construct the susquehanna-roseland transmission line that pjm has determined is necessary for the reliability of the regional transmission grid. although the ferc has granted our request for incentive rate treatment of such facilities, we cannot be certain that all costs that we may incur will be recoverable. in addition, the date when these facilities will be in service, which can be significantly impacted by delays related to public opposition or other factors, is subject to the outcome of future events that are not all within our control. as a result, we cannot predict the ultimate financial or operational impact of this project or other rtep projects on ppl electric. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to pennsylvania conservation and energy efficiency programs. act 129 became effective in october 2008. this law created requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposed new plr electricity supply procurement rules, provided remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing alternative energy portfolio standard. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified dates (2011 and 2013). utilities not meeting these requirements of act 129 are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. see "regulatory issues - energy policy act of 2005 - reliability standards" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information. cost recovery remains subject to political risks. although prior initiatives have not resulted in the enactment of such legislation, the possibility remains that certain pennsylvania legislators could introduce legislation to reinstate generation rate caps or otherwise limit cost recovery through rates for pennsylvania utilities. if such legislation were introduced and ultimately enacted, ppl electric could face severe financial consequences including operating losses and significant cash flow shortfalls. in addition, continuing uncertainty regarding ppl electric's ability to recover its market supply and other costs of operating its business could adversely affect its credit quality, financing costs and availability of credit facilities necessary to operate its business. ( ppl ) risks related to international regulated segment our u.k. delivery business is subject to risks with respect to rate regulation and operational performance. our u.k. delivery business is rate regulated and operates under an incentive-based regulatory framework. in addition, its ability to manage operational risk is critical to its financial performance. disruption to the distribution network could reduce profitability both directly through the higher costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that ofgem has in place relating to customer service levels. in december 2009, ofgem completed its rate review for the five-year period from april 1, 2010 through march 31, 2015, thus reducing regulatory rate risk in the international regulated segment until the next rate review which will be effective april 1, 2015. the regulated income of the international regulated segment and also the rav are to some extent linked to movements in the retail price index (rpi). reductions in the rpi would adversely impact revenues and the debt/rav ratio. our u.k. distribution business exposes us to risks related to u.k. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and political conditions and policies of the u.k. government. these risks may reduce the results of operations from our u.k. distribution business. 27 the acquisition, financing, development and operation of projects in the u.k. entail significant financial risks including: changes in laws or regulations relating to u.k. operations, including tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies; severe weather and natural disaster impacts on the electric sector and our assets; changes in labor relations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and in converting u.k. revenues to u.s. dollars, which can increase our expenses and/or impair our ability to meet such expenses, and difficulty moving funds out of the country in which the funds were earned; and compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws. the wpd midlands acquisition may not achieve its intended results, including anticipated cost savings, efficiencies and other benefits. although we completed the wpd midlands acquisition with the expectation that it will result in various benefits, including a significant amount of cost savings and other financial and operational benefits, there can be no assurance regarding the extent to which we will be able to realize these cost-savings or other benefits. achieving the anticipated benefits, including cost savings, is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses acquired can be operated in the manner we intend. events outside of our control, including but not limited to regulatory changes or developments in the u.k., could also adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the wpd midlands acquisition. thus, the integration process may be unpredictable, subject to delays or changed circumstances, and we can give no assurance that the acquired businesses will perform in accordance with our expectations. additional unanticipated costs may also arise during the integration process. the integration of the wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands) businesses may place an additional burden on our management and internal resources, and the diversion of management's attention during the integration and restructuring process could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and expected operating results. the wpd midlands acquisition exposes us to additional risks and uncertainties with respect to the acquired businesses and their operations. the wpd midlands acquisition will rebalance our business mix to a greater percentage of regulated operations. while we believe this should help mitigate our exposure to downturns in the wholesale power markets, it will increase our dependence on rate-of-return regulation. although we are already exposed to risks relating to rate-of-return regulation, the wpd midlands acquisition will increase these risks. the acquired businesses will generally be subject to risks similar to those to which we are subject to in our pre-acquisition u.k. businesses. these include: there are various changes being contemplated by ofgem to the current electricity distribution, gas transmission and gas distribution regulatory frameworks in the u.k. and there can be no assurance as to the effects such changes will have on our u.k. regulated businesses in the future, including the acquired businesses. in particular, in october 2010, ofgem announced a new regulatory framework that is expected to become effective in april 2015 for the electricity distribution sector in the u.k. the framework, known as riio (revenues = incentives + innovation + outputs), focuses on sustainability, environmental-focused output measures, promotion of low carbon energy networks and financing of new investments. the new regulatory framework is expected to have a wide-ranging effect on electricity distribution companies operating in the u.k., including changes to price controls and price review periods. our u.k. regulated businesses' compliance with this new regulatory framework may result in significant additional capital expenditures, increases in operating and compliance costs and adjustments to our pricing models. ofgem has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license. we are not currently aware of any planned modification to any of our u.k. regulated businesses distribution licenses that would result in a material adverse change to the u.k. regulated businesses and ppl. there can, however, be no assurance that a restrictive modification will not be introduced in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the u.k. regulated businesses and ppl. 28 a failure to operate our u.k. networks properly could lead to compensation payments or penalties, or a failure to make capital expenditures in line with agreed investment programs could lead to deterioration of the network. while our u.k. regulated businesses' investment programs are targeted to maintain asset conditions over a five-year period and reduce customer interruptions and customer minutes lost over that period, no assurance can be provided that these regulatory requirements will be met. a failure by any of our u.k. regulated businesses to comply with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by ofgem that could have an adverse impact on ppl. ofgem has powers to levy fines of up to 10 percent of revenue for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may be revoked. unless terminated in the circumstances mentioned above, a distribution license continues indefinitely until revoked by ofgem following no less than 25 years' written notice. we will be subject to increased foreign currency exchange rate risks because a greater portion of our cash flows and reported earnings will be generated by our u.k. business operations. these risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value of the british pound sterling and the u.s. dollar between the time we initially invest u.s. dollars in our u.k. businesses and the time that cash is repatriated to the u.s. from the u.k., including cash flows from our u.k. businesses that may be distributed as future dividends to our shareholders. in addition, our consolidated reported earnings on a u.s. gaap basis may be subject to increased earnings translation risk, which is the result of the conversion of earnings as reported in our u.k. businesses on a british pound sterling basis to a u.s. dollar basis in accordance with u.s. gaap requirements. environmental costs and liabilities associated with aspects of the acquired businesses may differ from those of our existing business. risks related to supply segment ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) we face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. unlike our regulated utility businesses, our energy supply business is dependent on our ability to operate in a competitive environment and is not assured of any rate of return on capital investments through a predetermined rate structure. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. these competitive factors may negatively impact our ability to sell electricity and related products and services, as well as the prices that we may charge for such products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow our business. we sell our available energy and capacity into the competitive wholesale markets through contracts of varying duration. competition in the wholesale power markets occurs principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and availability. we believe that the commencement of commercial operation of new electric facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity and the evolution of demand side management resources will continue to increase competition in the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on the prices we receive for electricity. we also face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary services. we primarily compete with other electricity suppliers based on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. we also compete against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to credit sources, and our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. competitors in the wholesale power markets in which ppl generation subsidiaries and ppl energyplus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators and competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities. in the past, the puhca significantly restricted mergers and acquisitions and other investments in the electric utility sector. entirely new competitors, including financial institutions, have entered the energy markets as a result of the repeal of the original puhca in 2006. the repeal of the original puhca also may lead to consolidation in our industry, resulting in competitors with significantly greater financial resources than we have. 29 adverse changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. our energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power exceed our costs to supply power, are impacted by changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, recs, electricity transmission and related congestion charges and other costs. unlike most commodities, the limited ability to store electric power requires that it must be consumed at the time of production. as a result, wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable. among the factors that influence such prices are: supply and demand for electricity available from current or new generation resources; variable production costs, primarily fuel (and the associated fuel transportation costs) and emission allowance expense for the generation resources used to meet the demand for electricity; transmission capacity and service into, or out of, markets served; changes in the regulatory framework for wholesale power markets; liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, as well as general creditworthiness of key participants in the market; and weather and economic conditions impacting demand for or the price of electricity or the facilities necessary to deliver electricity. we do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price volatility. we attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity sales obligations by either reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and services through competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts. we also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements and other electricity-related commodities. however, based on economic and other considerations, we may decide not to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price risk. to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price risk, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. we are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale and retail electricity markets. we purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based tariffs authorized by ferc throughout the u.s. and also enter into short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price fluctuations. if we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay damages. these damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of any undelivered capacity or electricity. depending on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be significant. extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, environmental compliance costs, transmission disruptions, and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and electricity. our wholesale power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post collateral for the benefit of our counterparties if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. we currently believe that we have sufficient credit to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these power contracts. our obligation to post collateral could exceed the amount of our facilities or our ability to increase our facilities could be limited by financial markets or other factors. see note 7 to the financial statements for a discussion of ppl's credit facilities. we also face credit risk that parties with whom we contract in both the wholesale and retail markets will default in their performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the time of contract. whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these risks using various means, including agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract price in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. however, there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance risk, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our obligations to other parties, which could in turn subject us to claims for damages. the load following contracts that ppl energyplus is awarded do not provide for specific levels of load and actual load significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy margins. 30 we generally hedge our load following obligations with energy purchases from third parties, and to a lesser extent with our own generation. if the actual load is significantly lower than the expected load, we may be required to resell power at a lower price than was contracted for to supply the load obligation, resulting in a financial loss. alternatively, a significant increase in load could adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of the load following contracts to provide the energy necessary to fulfill increased demand at the contract price, which could be lower than the cost to procure additional energy on the open market. therefore, any significant decrease or increase in load compared with our forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. we may experience disruptions in our fuel supply, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our generation facilities. we purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. disruption in the delivery of fuel and other products consumed during the production of electricity (such as coal, natural gas, oil, water, uranium, lime, limestone and other chemicals), including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. our risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency and counterparty credit and non-performance risks may not work as planned, and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs. we actively manage the market risk inherent in our generation and energy marketing activities, as well as our debt, foreign currency and counterparty credit positions. we have implemented procedures to monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs, including independent validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, portfolio stress tests, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics. nonetheless, our risk management programs may not work as planned. for example, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management calculations. additionally, unforeseen market disruptions could decrease market depth and liquidity, negatively impacting our ability to enter into new transactions. we enter into financial contracts to hedge commodity basis risk, and as a result are exposed to the risk that the correlation between delivery points could change with actual physical delivery. similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not designed to address. as a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events result in greater losses or costs than our risk models predict or greater volatility in our earnings and financial position. in addition, our trading, marketing and hedging activities are exposed to counterparty credit risk and market liquidity risk. we have adopted a credit risk management policy and program to evaluate counterparty credit risk. however, if counterparties fail to perform, the risk of which has increased due to the economic downturn, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices. in that event, our financial results are likely to be adversely affected. our costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital expenditures for pollution control improvements that, if delayed, would adversely affect our profitability and liquidity. our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection. to comply with existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control measures we may take, we have spent and expect to spend substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and compliance. in order to comply with existing and proposed federal and state environmental laws and regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-fired plants, in 2005 ppl began a program to install scrubbers and other pollution control equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxides with co-benefits for mercury emissions reduction). the cost to install this equipment was approximately $1.6 billion. the scrubbers at our montour and brunner island plants are now in service. many states and environmental groups have challenged certain federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict. as a result, it is possible that state and federal regulations will be adopted that would impose more stringent restrictions than are currently in effect, which could require us to significantly increase capital expenditures for additional pollution control equipment. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for our planned capital projects which are necessary to our business. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we 31 fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted, reduced or subjected to additional costs. furthermore, at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. for more information regarding environmental matters, including existing and proposed federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations to which we are subject, see "environmental matters - domestic" in note 15 to the financial statements. we rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control to deliver our wholesale electricity. if transmission is disrupted, or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver power may be hindered. we depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell in the wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric generation facilities. if transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by isos and rtos, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or we may be unable to sell products at the most favorable terms. the ferc has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that transmission capacity will not be available in the amounts we require. we cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether isos and rtos in applicable markets will efficiently operate transmission networks and provide related services. despite federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or prevent or delay operation of our facilities. our generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market. generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the ferc. the ferc has authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices. the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates. any reduction by the ferc in the rates we may receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations. see "ferc market-based rate authority" in note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the ferc's market-based rate authority program. in addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals. if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to additional costs. if market deregulation is reversed or discontinued, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in some markets, state legislators, government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of these markets that have previously been competitive or permit electricity delivery companies to construct or acquire generating facilities. the isos that oversee the transmission systems in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address extremely high prices in the power markets. these types of price limitations and other mechanisms may reduce profits that our wholesale power marketing and trading business would have realized under competitive market conditions absent such limitations and mechanisms. although we generally expect electricity markets to continue to be competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our industry may be made, and legislative or other actions affecting the electric power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or reversed in states in which we currently, or may in the future, operate. see "new jersey capacity legislation" in note 15 to the financial statements. changes in technology may negatively impact the value of our power plants. a basic premise of our generation business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at relatively low prices. there are alternate technologies to produce electricity, most notably fuel 32 cells, micro turbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells, the development of which has been expanded due to global climate change concerns. research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in alternate technologies. it is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternate methods of electricity production to a level that is equal to or below that of certain central station production. also, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators. these alternative energy sources could result in a decline to the dispatch and capacity factors of our plants. as a result of all of these factors, the value of our generation facilities could be significantly reduced. we are subject to certain risks associated with nuclear generation, including the risk that our susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to increased security or safety requirements that would increase capital and operating expenditures, uncertainties regarding spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its licensed life. nuclear generation accounted for about 28% of our 2011 generation output. the risks of nuclear generation generally include: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. the licenses for our two nuclear units expire in 2042 and 2044. see note 21 to the financial statements for additional information on the aro related to the decommissioning. the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, including security, safety and employee-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. in the event of noncompliance, the nrc has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. in addition, revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital or operating expenditures at our susquehanna nuclear plant. there also remains substantial uncertainty regarding the temporary storage and permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel, which could result in substantial additional costs to ppl that cannot be predicted. in addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our susquehanna plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational loss, damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. see note 15 to the financial statements for a discussion of nuclear insurance. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppl corporation, ppl energy supply, llc, ppl

company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. we did not audit the 2010 financial statements of lg&amp;e and ku energy llc (lke), a wholly owned subsidiary, which statements reflect total assets of $10,719 million as of december 31, 2010, and total revenues of $493 million for the period november 1, 2010 (date of acquisition) to december 31, 2010. those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for lke, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. in our opinion, based on our audits and, for 2010, the report of other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ppl corporation and subsidiaries at december 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2011, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted

established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (the coso criteria). ppl corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting at item 9a. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. as set forth in item 9a, management's report on internal control over financial reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of wpd midlands, which is included in the 2011 consolidated financial statements of ppl corporation and subsidiaries and constituted 19% and 27% of total assets and net assets, respectively, as of december 31, 2011 and 6% and 9% of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. our audit of internal control over financial reporting of ppl corporation

headquartered in allentown, pennsylvania, is an energy and utility holding company that was incorporated in 1994. through subsidiaries, ppl generates electricity from power plants in the northeastern, northwestern and southeastern u.s.; markets wholesale or retail energy primarily in the northeastern and northwestern portions of the u.s.; delivers electricity to customers in pennsylvania, kentucky, virginia, tennessee and the u.k.; and delivers natural gas to customers in kentucky. ppl's overall strategy is to achieve stable, long-term growth in its regulated electricity delivery businesses through efficient operations and strong customer and regulatory relations, and disciplined optimization of energy supply margins in its energy supply business while mitigating volatility in both cash flows and earnings. in pursuing this strategy, in 2011 and 2010, ppl completed two significant acquisitions that have reduced ppl's overall business risk profile and reapportioned the mix of ppl's regulated and competitive businesses by increasing the regulated portion of its business: on april 1, 2011, ppl, through an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, ppl wem, completed its acquisition of all the outstanding ordinary share capital of central networks east plc and central networks limited, the sole owner of central networks west plc, together with certain other related assets and liabilities (collectively referred to as central networks and subsequently renamed wpd midlands), from subsidiaries of e.on ag. wpd midlands operates two regulated distribution networks that serve five million end-users in the midlands area of england. on november 1, 2010, ppl acquired all of the limited liability company interests of e.on u.s. llc from a wholly owned subsidiary of e.on ag. upon completion of the acquisition, e.on u.s. llc was renamed lg&amp;e and ku energy llc (lke). lke is engaged in regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, lg&amp;e and ku. see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information on both acquisitions. each rate-regulated business plans to make material capital investments over the next several years to improve infrastructure and customer reliability. see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources" for information on each registrant's capital expenditure projections. a key objective of ppl's business strategy is to maintain a strong credit profile. ppl's recent growth in rate-regulated businesses has provided the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through ppl capital funding, that further enables ppl to support targeted credit profiles cost effectively across all of ppl's rated companies. as a result, ppl plans to further utilize ppl capital funding in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies, as appropriate. at december 31, 2012, ppl had: $12.3 billion in operating revenues for the year (56% from regulated businesses), 10.5 million end-users of its utility services, approximately 19,000 mw of generation (44% within regulated businesses), and approximately 18,000 full-time employees. ppl's principal subsidiaries at december 31, 2012 are shown below (* denotes an sec registrant). 3 ppl corporation* ppl capital funding lke*

subsidiaries, lg&amp;e and ku, and is a subsidiary of ppl. lke, formed in 2003, is the successor to a kentucky entity incorporated in 1989. louisville gas and electric company, headquartered in louisville, kentucky, is a regulated utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. lg&amp;e was incorporated in kentucky in 1913. at december 31, 2012, lg&amp;e owned 3,354 mw of electric power generation capacity and is implementing capital projects at an existing generation facility to provide 141 mw of additional generating capacity by the end of 2015. lg&amp;e also anticipates retiring 563 mw of coal-fired generating capacity by the end of 2015 to meet certain environmental regulations. lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail native load. kentucky utilities company, headquartered in lexington, kentucky, is a regulated utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky, virginia and tennessee. ku was incorporated in kentucky in 1912 and virginia in 1991. ku serves its virginia customers under the old dominion power name while its kentucky and tennessee customers are served under the ku name. at december 31, 2012, ku owned 4,833 mw of electric power generation capacity and is implementing capital projects at an existing generation facility owned by lg&amp;e to provide 499 mw of additional generating capacity by the end of 2015. ku retired the remaining 71 mw unit at the tyrone plant in february 2013. ku also anticipates retiring 163 mw of coal-fired generating capacity by the end of 2015 to meet certain environmental regulations. ku and lg&amp;e jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail native load. ppl electric utilities corporation , headquartered in allentown, pennsylvania, is a direct subsidiary of ppl incorporated in pennsylvania in 1920 and a regulated public utility. ppl electric delivers electricity in its pennsylvania service territory and provides electricity supply to retail customers in that territory as a plr under the customer choice act. 4 ppl energy supply, llc , headquartered in allentown, pennsylvania, is an indirect subsidiary of ppl formed in 2000 and is an energy company engaged through its subsidiaries in the generation and marketing of electricity, primarily in the northeastern and northwestern power markets of the u.s. ppl energy supply's major operating subsidiaries are ppl energyplus and ppl generation. in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its entire membership interest in ppl global to its parent, ppl energy funding (the parent holding company of ppl energy supply and ppl global with no other material operations), to better align ppl's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages these businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements. the distribution separated the u.s.-based competitive energy marketing and supply business from the u.k.-based regulated electricity distribution business. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information. the 2010 operating results of ppl global, which represented the u.k. regulated segment (formerly international regulated), are classified as discontinued operations. at december 31, 2012, ppl energy supply owned or controlled 10,591 mw of electric power generation capacity and is implementing capital projects at certain of its existing generation facilities in pennsylvania and montana to provide 153 mw of additional generating capacity by the end of 2013. ppl's utility subsidiaries, and to a lesser extent, certain competitive supply subsidiaries, are subject to extensive regulation by the ferc related to wholesale power sales and related transactions, electricity transmission service, accounting practices, issuances and sales of securities, acquisitions and sales of utility properties and payments of dividends. ppl and lke are subject to certain ferc regulations as holding companies under puhca and the federal power act, including with respect to accounting and record-keeping, inter-system sales of non-power goods and services and acquisitions of securities in, or mergers with, certain types of electric utility companies. successor and predecessor financial presentation (lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lke's, lg&amp;e's and ku's financial statements and related financial and operating data include the periods before and after ppl's acquisition of lke on november 1, 2010 and have been segregated to present pre-acquisition activity as the predecessor and post-acquisition activity as the successor. certain accounting and presentation methods were changed to acceptable alternatives to conform to ppl's accounting policies, and the cost bases of certain assets and liabilities were changed as of november 1, 2010 as a result of the application of push-down accounting. consequently, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the successor periods are not comparable to the predecessor periods; however, the core operations of lke, lg&amp;e and ku have not changed as a result of the acquisition. segment information (ppl) ppl is organized into four reportable segments: kentucky regulated, u.k. regulated (name changed in 2012 from international regulated), pennsylvania regulated and supply. there were no changes to reportable segments in 2012 other than the name change noted above. a comparison of ppl's three regulated segments is shown below: ky regulated (a) u.k. regulated (b) pa regulated (c) for the year ended december 31, 2012: operating revenues (in billions) $2.8 $2.3 $1.8 net income attributable to ppl shareowners (in millions) $177 $803 $132 electric energy delivered (gwh) 30,908 77,467 36,023 at

generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas. (b) business activities include the distribution of electricity. (c) business activities include the transmission and distribution of electricity. (d) represents rav for u.k. regulated, capitalization for ky regulated and rate base for pa regulated. 5 (ppl energy supply) ppl energy supply has operated in a single reportable segment since 2011. prior to 2011, ppl energy supply's segments consisted of supply and u.k. regulated (formerly international regulated). in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its 100% membership interest in ppl global to its parent, ppl energy funding, to better align ppl's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages its businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements. the distribution separated the u.s.-based competitive energy marketing and supply business from the u.k.-based regulated electricity distribution business. the 2010 operating results of ppl global, which represented the u.k. regulated segment, are classified as discontinued operations for ppl energy supply. (ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku each operate within a single reportable segment. (ppl) see note 2 to the financial statements for financial information about the segments. kentucky regulated segment (ppl) consists of the operations of lke, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of lg&amp;e and ku. the kentucky regulated segment also includes interest expense related to the 2010 equity units that were issued to partially finance the acquisition of lke. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lke became a wholly owned subsidiary of ppl on november 1, 2010. lg&amp;e and ku are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky and, in ku's case, virginia and tennessee. lg&amp;e also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. lg&amp;e provides electric service to approximately 393,000 customers in louisville and adjacent areas in kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in 9 counties. lg&amp;e provides natural gas service to approximately 318,000 customers in its electric service area and 7 additional counties in kentucky. ku provides electric service to approximately 510,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western kentucky; approximately 29,000 customers in 5 counties in southwestern virginia; and fewer than 10 customers in tennessee, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. ku also sells wholesale electricity to 12 municipalities in kentucky under load following contracts. in virginia, ku operates under the name old dominion power company. acquisition by ppl in september 2010, the kpsc approved a settlement agreement among ppl and all of the intervening parties to ppl's joint application to the kpsc for approval of its acquisition of ownership and control of lke. in the settlement agreement, the parties agreed that lg&amp;e and ku would commit that no base rate increases would take effect before january 1, 2013. under the terms of the settlement, lg&amp;e and ku retained the right to seek approval for the deferral of "extraordinary and uncontrollable costs." interim rate adjustments continued to be permissible during that period through existing fuel, environmental and demand side management recovery mechanisms. in october 2010, both the vscc and the tra approved the transfer of control of lke to ppl. the orders and the settlement agreement approved by the kpsc contained certain other commitments by lg&amp;e and ku with regard to operations, workforce, community involvement and other matters. also in october 2010, the ferc approved the application for the transfer of control of the utilities. the approval included various conditional commitments, such as a continuation of certain existing undertakings with intervenors in prior cases, an agreement not to terminate certain ku municipal customer contracts prior to january 2017, an exclusion of any transaction-related costs from wholesale energy and tariff customer rates to the extent that lg&amp;e and ku have agreed not to seek recovery of the same transaction-related costs from retail customers and agreements to coordinate with intervenors in certain pending matters. see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information on regulatory matters related to the acquisition. 6 franchises and licenses lg&amp;e and ku provide electricity delivery service, and lg&amp;e provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. competition there are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of lke. from time to time, bills are introduced into the kentucky general assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. neither the kentucky general assembly nor the kpsc has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in kentucky. the nature or timing of any legislative or regulatory actions regarding industry restructuring and their impact on lke, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. ku's operations in virginia have been and remain regulated. alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels provide indirect competition for natural gas revenues of lke. marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. lg&amp;e's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity; therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact profitability. however, some large industrial and commercial customers may physically bypass lg&amp;e's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems. operating revenues details of operating revenues by customer class are shown below. successor predecessor year ended year ended two months ended ten months ended december 31, 2012 december 31, 2011 december 31, 2010 october 31, 2010 % of % of % of % of revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue lke (a) commercial $ 723 26 $ 719 26 $ 123 25 $ 573 26 industrial 551 20 533 19 86 17 424 19 residential 1,071 39 1,087 39 219 44 886 40 retail - other 270 10 269 9 43 9 212 10 wholesale - municipal 102 4 104 4 15 3 88 4 wholesale - other (b) 42 1 81 3 8 2 31 1 total $ 2,759 100 $ 2,793 100 $ 494 100 $ 2,214 100 lg&amp;e commercial $ 374 28 $ 372 27 $ 66 26 $ 287 27 industrial 170 13 152 11 26 10 122 12 residential 548 41 561 41 113 44 446 42 retail - other 131 10 130 10 22 9 98 9 wholesale - other (b) (c) 101 8 149 11 27 11 104 10 total $ 1,324 100 $ 1,364 100 $ 254 100 $ 1,057 100 ku commercial $ 349 23 $ 347 22 $ 57 22 $ 286 23 industrial 381 25 381 25 60 23 302 24 residential 523 34 526 34 106 40 440 35 retail - other 139 9 139 9 21 8 114 9 wholesale - municipal 102 7 104 7 15 6 88 7 wholesale - other (b) (c) 30 2 51 3 4 1 18 2 total $ 1,524 100 $ 1,548 100 $ 263 100 $ 1,248 100 (a) the lke successor information also represents ppl's kentucky regulated segment.

(b) this generation represents a 4% decrease for lke, a 4% decrease for lg&amp;e and a 3% decrease for ku from 2011 output. a significant portion of lg&amp;e's and ku's generated electricity was used to supply its retail and municipal customer base. lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail native load. when lg&amp;e has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail native load and its generation cost is lower than that of ku, ku purchases electricity from lg&amp;e. when ku has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail native load and its generation cost is lower than that of lg&amp;e, lg&amp;e purchases electricity from ku. see "item 2. properties - kentucky regulated segment" for additional information regarding lg&amp;e's and ku's plans for development of cane run unit 7. ku retired the remaining 71 mw unit at the tyrone plant in february 2013. lg&amp;e and ku also anticipate retiring 563 mw and 163 mw of coal-fired generating capacity by the end of 2015 to meet certain environmental regulations. fuel supply coal is expected to be the predominant fuel used by lg&amp;e and ku for baseload generation for the foreseeable future. however, natural gas will play a more significant role starting in 2015 when cane run unit 7 is expected to be placed into operation. this unit is expected to be used for baseload generation. natural gas and oil will continue to be used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. to enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, lg&amp;e and ku have secured long-term pipeline capacity on the interstate pipeline serving the new combined cycle unit and six simple cycle combustion turbine units. lg&amp;e and ku have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2017 and normally augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. for their existing units, lg&amp;e and ku expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western kentucky, southern indiana, southern illinois and ohio. the use of high sulfur coal increased during 2012 due to the installation of scrubbers and the sulfuric acid mist mitigation system at ku's e.w. brown plant. in 2013 and beyond, lg&amp;e and ku may purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from wyoming for blending at tc2. coal is delivered to the generating plants by barge, truck and rail. 8 (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) natural gas supply five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 bcf, are used in providing natural gas service to lg&amp;e's firm sales customers. by using natural gas storage facilities, lg&amp;e avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads. natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. without this storage capacity, lg&amp;e would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are typically at their highest. several suppliers under contracts of varying duration provide competitively priced natural gas. at december 31, 2012, lg&amp;e had a 12 bcf inventory balance of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $42 million. lg&amp;e has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying terms with a number of suppliers designed to meet its firm sales obligations. these natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. in tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. lg&amp;e purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. lg&amp;e has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by lg&amp;e between 2015 and 2018. total winter capacity under these contracts is 194,900 mmbtu/day and summer capacity is 88,000 mmbtu/day. lg&amp;e has a contract with another pipeline that expires in october 2014. total winter and summer capacity under this contract is 20,000 mmbtu/day during both seasons. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) rates and regulation lg&amp;e is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc and the ferc, and ku is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc, the ferc, the vscc and the tra. lg&amp;e and ku operate under a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff. lg&amp;e and ku contract with the tennessee valley authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator. lg&amp;e and ku contracted with southwest power pool, inc. (spp), to function as their independent transmission operator, pursuant to ferc requirements under a contract that expired on august 31, 2012. after receiving ferc approval, lg&amp;e and ku transferred from spp to transerv international, inc. as their independent transmission operator beginning september 1, 2012. in february 2013, lg&amp;e and ku submitted a compliance filing to the ferc reflecting their participation with other utilities in the southeastern regional transmission planning relating to certain ferc order 1000 requirements. ferc order 1000, issued in july 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electric transmission planning activities. lg&amp;e's and ku's kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including certain adjustments to exclude non-regulated investments and costs recovered separately through other rate mechanisms. as such, lg&amp;e and ku earn a return on the net cash invested in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities. ku's virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of virginia base rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. ku's rates to municipal customers for wholesale requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a rate formula that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms. 9 2012 kentucky rate case in june 2012, lg&amp;e and ku filed requests with the kpsc for increases in annual base electric rates of approximately $62 million at lg&amp;e and approximately $82 million at ku and an increase in annual base gas rates of approximately $17 million at lg&amp;e. in november 2012, lg&amp;e and ku along with all of the parties filed a unanimous settlement agreement. among other things, the settlement provided for increases in annual base electric rates of $34 million at lg&amp;e and $51 million at ku and an increase in annual base gas rates of $15 million at lg&amp;e. the settlement agreement also included revised depreciation rates that result in reduced annual electric depreciation expense of approximately $9 million for lg&amp;e and approximately $10 million for ku. the settlement agreement included an authorized return on equity at lg&amp;e and ku of 10.25%. on december 20, 2012, the kpsc issued orders approving the provisions in the settlement agreement. the new rates became effective on january 1, 2013. in addition to the increased base rates, the kpsc approved a gas line tracker mechanism for lg&amp;e to provide for recovery of costs associated with lg&amp;e's gas main replacement program, gas service lines and risers. ferc wholesale rates in may 2012, ku submitted to the ferc the annual adjustments to the formula rate which incorporated certain proposed increases. these rates became effective as of july 1, 2012. u.k. regulated segment (ppl) includes wpd, a regulated electricity distribution business in the u.k. wpd, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, operates four of the 15 regulated distribution networks providing electricity service in the u.k. with the april 2011 acquisition of wpd midlands, the number of end-users served has more than doubled totaling 7.8 million across 21,400 square miles in wales, southwest and central england. see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information on the acquisition. details of revenue by category for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2012 2011 2010 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue utility revenues (a) $ 2,289 98 $ 1,618 98 $ 727 96 energy-related businesses 47 2 35 2 34 4 total $ 2,336 100 $ 1,653 100 $ 761 100 (a) the above years are not comparable as wpd midlands was acquired in april 2011. 2011 includes eight months of activity as wpd midlands' results are recorded on a one-month lag. wpd's energy-related businesses revenues include ancillary activities that support the distribution business, including telecommunications and real estate. wpd's telecommunication revenues are from the rental of fiber optic cables primarily attached to wpd's overhead electricity distribution network. wpd also provides meter services to businesses across the u.k. franchise and licenses wpd is authorized by ofgem to provide electric distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. for instance, wpd is subject to ofgem regulation of the regulated revenue it can earn and the quality of service it must provide, and wpd can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service. competition although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. wpd's four distribution businesses, wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (west midlands) and wpd (east midlands), are thus regulated monopolies which operate under regulatory price controls. 10 revenue and regulation the operations of wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands) are regulated by ofgem under the direction of the gas and electricity markets authority. the electricity act 1989 provides the fundamental legal framework of electricity companies and established licenses that required each of the dnos to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. ofgem has established a price control mechanism that restricts the amount of revenue that can be earned by regulated business and provides for an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for exceeding or underperforming against pre-established targets. this regulatory structure is an incentive-based regulatory structure in comparison to the u.s. utility businesses which operate under a cost-based regulatory framework. under the uk regulatory structure, electricity distribution revenues are currently set every five years, but extending to eight years in the next price control period beginning in april 2015. the revenue that dnos can earn in each of the five years is the sum of: i) the regulator's view of efficient operating costs, ii) a return on the capital from the rav plus an annual adjustment for the inflation determined by retail price index (rpi) for the prior calendar year, iii) a return of capital from the rav (i.e. depreciation), and iv) certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control. additionally, incentives are provided for a range of activities including exceeding certain reliability and customer service targets. wpd is currently operating under dpcr5 which was completed in december 2009 and is effective for the period from april 1, 2010 through march 31, 2015. ofgem allowed wpd (south west) and wpd (south wales) an average increase in total revenues, before inflationary adjustments, of 6.9% in each of the five years and wpd midlands an average increase in total revenues, before inflationary adjustments, of 4.5% in each of the five years. the revenue increase includes reimbursement for higher operating and capital costs to be incurred driven by additional requirements. in dpcr5, ofgem decoupled wpd's allowed revenue from volume delivered over the five-year price control period. however, in any fiscal period wpd's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a given period. under recoveries are recovered in the next regulatory year, however, ppl does not record a receivable for under recoveries in the current period. over recoveries are reflected in the current period as a liability and are not included in revenue. in addition to providing a base regulated revenue allowance, ofgem has established incentive mechanisms to provide significant opportunities to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. some of the more significant incentive mechanisms under dpcr5 include: interruptions incentive scheme (iis) - this incentive has two major components: 1) customer interruptions and 2) customer minutes lost and is designed to incentivize the dnos to invest and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages experienced by customers. the target for each dno is based on a benchmark of data from the last four years of the prior price control period. effective april 1, 2012, an additional customer satisfaction incentive mechanism was implemented that includes a customer satisfaction survey, a complaints metric and a measure of stakeholder engagement. this incentive replaced the customer response telephone performance incentive that was effective april 1, 2010. line loss incentive - this incentive existed in the prior price control review, dpcr4, and was designed to incentivize dnos to invest in lower loss equipment, to change the way they operate their systems to reduce losses, and to detect theft and unregistered meters. in november 2012, ofgem issued a decision not to activate the dpcr5 line loss incentive. see note 6 to the financial statements for information on ofgem's review of line loss calculations. information quality incentive (iqi) - the iqi is designed to incentivize the dnos to provide good quality information when they submit their business plans to ofgem during the price control process and to execute the plan they submitted. the iqi eliminates the distinction between capital expenditure and operating expense and instead looks at total expenditure. total expenditure is allocated 85% to "slow pot" which is added to rav and recovered over 20 years through the regulatory depreciation of the rav and 15% to "fast pot" which is recovered during the current price control review period. the iqi then provides for incentives or penalties at the end of dpcr5 based on the ratio of actual expenditures to the expenditures submitted to ofgem that were the basis for the revenues allowed during the five-year price control review period. 11 at the beginning of dpcr5, wpd was awarded $301 million in incentive revenue of which $222 million will be included in revenue throughout the current price control period with the balance recovered over subsequent price control periods. since the beginning of dpcr5, wpd earned additional incentive revenue, primarily from iis of $83 million and $30 million for the regulatory years ended march 31, 2012 and 2011, which will be included in revenue for the 2013-14 and 2012-13 regulatory years. in october 2010, ofgem announced a new pricing model that will be effective for the u.k. electricity distribution sector, including wpd, beginning april 2015. the model, known as riio (revenues = incentives + innovation + outputs), is intended to encourage investment in regulated infrastructure. the next electricity distribution price control review is referred to as riio-ed1. in september 2012, ofgem published a strategy consultation document providing an overview of its approach for riio-ed1 and is expected to publish a policy decision document in february 2013. key components of the riio-ed1 are: an extension of the price review period to eight years, increased emphasis on outputs and incentives, enhanced stakeholder engagement including network customers, a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation, expansion of the current low carbon network fund to stimulate innovation and continued use of a single weighted average cost of capital. ofgem has also indicated that the depreciation of the rav for rav additions after april 1, 2015 will change from 20 years to 45 years. management is in the process of creating the "well-justified business plans" required by ofgem for wpd's four dnos. these plans are expected to be submitted to ofgem in july 2013 as part of the riio-ed1 review process. once the business plans are complete, management will be in a better position to determine the effect of riio-ed1 on future financial results. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to u.k. regulated segment." customers the majority of wpd's revenue is known as duos and is derived from charging energy suppliers for the delivery of electricity to end-users and thus its customers are the suppliers to those end-users. ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the distribution connection and use of system agreement. this agreement sets out how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to provide collateral. pennsylvania regulated segment (ppl) includes the regulated electric delivery operations of ppl electric. (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the puc, and certain of its transmission activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the federal power act. ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central pennsylvania. ppl electric also provides electricity supply in this territory as a plr. details of electric revenues by customer class for the years ended december 31, are shown below. 2012 2011 2010 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue residential $ 1,108 63 $ 1,266 67 $ 1,469 60 industrial 53 3 62 3 123 5 commercial 366 21 431 23 588 24 other (a) (b) 236 13 133 7 275 11 total $ 1,763 100 $ 1,892 100 $ 2,455 100 (a) includes regulatory over- or under-recovery reconciliation mechanisms, pole attachment revenues, street lighting and net transmission revenues. (b) included in these amounts for 2012, 2011 and 2010 are $3 million, $11 million and $7 million of retail and wholesale electric to affiliate revenue which is eliminated in consolidation for ppl. franchise, licenses and other regulations ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies to which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. 12 competition pursuant to authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electric distribution business. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under the purview of the ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to competition from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to building and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. no authority has yet been promulgated that sets forth the parameters of non-incumbent competition. rates and regulation transmission and distribution ppl electric's transmission facilities are within pjm, which operates the electric transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. pjm serves as a ferc-approved rto to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. in addition to operating the electric transmission network, pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary objective of any rto is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the rto directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. as a transmission owner, ppl electric's transmission revenues are billed to pjm in accordance with a ferc tariff that allows recovery of transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update. as a plr, ppl electric also purchases transmission services from pjm. see "plr" below. in april 2010, the ferc issued an order concluding that under the pjm open access transmission tariff, pjm may, but is not required to, designate an entity other than the incumbent pjm transmission owner to own and construct economic expansion projects and receive cost-of-service based compensation for the use of its facilities. additionally, the ferc directed pjm to file tariff changes necessary for non-incumbent transmission owners to be provided opportunity to propose and construct transmission projects in accordance with exclusions specified in the april 2010 order and consistent with state and local laws and regulations. pjm tariff changes are currently under review by the ferc. ppl electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions such as materials and supplies inventories and customer deposits and advances) plus certain operating expenses. operating expenses included in ppl electric's distribution base rates include wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and taxes. in november 2004, pennsylvania enacted the aeps, which requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania from alternative energy sources. under the default service procurement plans approved by the puc, ppl electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the aeps. act 129 creates an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new plr generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct, and changes to the existing aeps. act 11 authorizes the puc to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms - the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, a dsic. in august 2012, the puc issued a final implementation order adopting procedures, guidelines and a model tariff for implementation of act 11. act 11 requires utilities to file an ltiip as a prerequisite to filing for recovery through the dsic. the ltiip is mandated to be a five- to ten-year plan describing projects eligible for inclusion in the dsic. ppl electric filed its ltiip in september 2012 and the puc subsequently approved the ltiip on january 10, 2013. ppl electric filed a petition requesting permission to establish a dsic on january 15, 2013 with rates proposed to be effective beginning may 1, 2013. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129, act 11 and other legislative and regulatory impacts. 13 plr the customer choice act requires electric distribution companies (edcs), including ppl electric, to act as a plr of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the plr pursuant to regulations established by the puc. as of december 31, 2012, the following percentages of ppl electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 46% of residential, 84% of small commercial and industrial and 99% of large commercial and industrial customers. the puc continues to be interested in expanding the competitive market for electricity. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. ppl electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period january 2011 through may 2013, which includes 14 solicitations for electricity supply beginning january 1, 2011 with a portion extending beyond may 2013. pursuant to this plan, ppl electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, large commercial and large industrial customers who elect to take that service from ppl electric. these solicitations include a mix of spot market purchases and long-term and short-term purchases ranging from five months to ten years to fulfill ppl electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a plr. to date, ppl electric has concluded all of its planned competitive solicitations under the plan. the puc has directed all edcs to file default service procurement plans for the period june 1, 2013 through may 31, 2015. ppl electric filed its plan in may 2012. in that plan, ppl electric proposed a process to obtain supply for its default service customers and a number of initiatives designed to encourage more customers to purchase electricity supply from the competitive retail market. in its january 24, 2013 final order, the puc approved ppl electric's plan with modifications and directed ppl electric to establish collaborative processes to address several retail competition issues. numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in ppl electric's service territory. whether its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers or from ppl electric as a plr, the purchase of such supply has no impact on the financial results of ppl electric. the costs to purchase plr supply, including charges paid to pjm for related transmission services, are passed directly by ppl electric to its plr customers without markup. see "energy purchase commitments" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding ppl electric's solicitations. rate cases 2012 rate case in march 2012, ppl electric filed a request with the puc to increase distribution rates by approximately $105 million, effective january 1, 2013. on december 28, 2012, in its final order, the puc approved a 10.4% return on equity and a total distribution revenue increase of about $71 million. the approved rates became effective january 1, 2013. also in its december 28, 2012 final order, the puc directed ppl electric to file a proposed storm damage expense rider within 90 days following the order. ppl electric plans to file a proposed storm damage expense rider with the puc and, as part of that filing, request recovery of the $28 million of qualifying storm costs incurred as a result of the october 2012 landfall of hurricane sandy. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities - storm costs" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on hurricane sandy. ferc formula rates transmission rates are regulated by the ferc. ppl electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. ppl electric has initiated its formula rate 2012, 2011 and 2010 annual updates. each update has been subsequently challenged by a group of municipal customers. in august 2011, the ferc issued an order substantially rejecting the 2010 formal challenge and the municipal customers filed a request for rehearing of that order. in september 2012, the ferc issued an order setting for evidentiary hearings and settlement judge procedures a number of issues raised in the 2010 and 2011 formal challenges. settlement conferences were held in late 2012 and early 2013. in february 2013, the ferc set for evidentiary hearings and settlement judge procedures a number of issues in the 2012 formal challenge and consolidated that 14 challenge with the 2010 and 2011 challenges. ppl electric anticipates that there will be additional settlement conferences held in 2013. ppl and ppl electric cannot predict the outcome of the foregoing proceedings, which remain pending before the ferc. in march 2012, ppl electric filed a request with the ferc seeking recovery of its regulatory asset related to the deferred state tax liability that existed at the time of the transition from the flow-through treatment of state income taxes to full normalization. this change in tax treatment occurred in 2008 as a result of prior ferc initiatives that transferred regulatory jurisdiction of certain transmission assets from the puc to ferc. at december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011, $52 million and $53 million are classified as taxes recoverable through future rates and included on the balance sheets in "other noncurrent assets - regulatory assets." in may 2012, the ferc issued an order approving ppl electric's request to recover the deferred tax regulatory asset over a 34-year period beginning june 1, 2012. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on rate mechanisms. (ppl and ppl energy supply) supply segment owns and operates competitive domestic power plants to generate electricity; markets and trades this electricity, purchased power, and other energy-related products to competitive wholesale and retail markets; and acquires and develops competitive domestic generation projects. consists primarily of the activities of ppl generation and ppl energyplus. ppl energy supply has generation assets that are located in the northeastern and northwestern u.s. markets. the northeastern generating capacity is located primarily in pennsylvania within pjm and northwestern generating capacity is located in montana. ppl energy supply enters into energy and energy-related contracts to hedge the variability of expected cash flows associated with its generating units and marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes. ppl energyplus sells the electricity produced by ppl energy supply's generation plants based on prevailing market rates. ppl energy supply's total expected generation in 2013 is anticipated to be used to meet its committed contractual sales. ppl energy supply has entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for 2014 and beyond. details of revenue by category for the years ended december 31, are shown below. 2012 2011 2010 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue energy wholesale (a) $ 4,200 76 $ 5,240 82 $ 4,347 85 retail 848 16 727 11 415 8 trading 4 (2) 2 total energy 5,052 92 5,965 93 4,764 93 energy-related businesses (b) 448 8 464 7 364 7 total $ 5,500 100 $ 6,429 100 $ 5,128 100 (a) included in these amounts for 2012, 2011, and 2010 are $78 million, $26 million and $320 million of wholesale electricity sales to an affiliate, ppl electric, which are eliminated in consolidation for ppl.

these plants into the wholesale market as well as to commercial, industrial and institutional customers. ppl energy supply's generation subsidiaries are ewgs that sell electricity into wholesale markets. ewgs are subject to regulation by the ferc, which has authorized these ewgs to sell the electricity generated at market-based prices. this electricity is sold to ppl energyplus under ferc-jurisdictional power purchase agreements. ppl susquehanna is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of the susquehanna nuclear units. certain of ppl energy supply's other subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of their fossil plants with respect to certain level and density monitoring devices. certain operations of ppl generation's subsidiaries are also subject to osha and comparable state statutes. see note 9 to the financial statements for information on the 2011 sale of certain non-core generation facilities, the 2010 sale of the long island generation business and the 2010 completion of the sale of the maine hydroelectric generation business. see "item 2. properties - supply segment" for additional information regarding ppl generation's plans for capital projects in pennsylvania and montana that are expected to provide 153 mw of additional electric generating capacity by the end of 2013. fuel supply ppl energyplus acts as agent for ppl generation to procure and optimize its various fuels. coal pennsylvania ppl energyplus actively manages ppl energy supply's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in northern appalachia. during 2012, ppl generation purchased 5.6 million tons of coal required for its wholly owned pennsylvania plants under short-term and long-term contracts. the amount of coal in inventory varies from time to time depending on market conditions and plant operations. ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, has agreements in place that will provide more than 23 million tons of ppl generation's projected coal needs for the pennsylvania power plants from 2013 through 2018. a ppl generation subsidiary owns a 12.34% interest in the keystone plant and a 16.25% interest in the conemaugh plant. ppl generation owns a 12.34% interest in keystone fuels, llc and a 16.25% interest in conemaugh fuels, llc. the keystone plant contracts with keystone fuels, llc for its coal requirements, which provided 4.3 million tons of coal to the keystone plant in 2012. the conemaugh plant requirements are purchased under contract from conemaugh fuels, llc, which provided 4.1 million tons of coal to the conemaugh plant in 2012. all ppl generation coal plants within pennsylvania are equipped with scrubbers, which use limestone in their operations. acting as agent for ppl generation, ppl energyplus has entered into contracts with limestone suppliers that will provide for those plants' limestone requirements through 2014. during 2012, 382,000 tons of limestone were delivered to brunner island and montour under these contracts. annual limestone requirements approximate 400,000-500,000 tons. 16 montana ppl montana has a 50% leasehold interest in colstrip units 1 and 2, and a 30% leasehold interest in colstrip unit 3. northwestern owns a 30% interest in colstrip unit 4. ppl montana and northwestern have a sharing agreement that governs each party's responsibilities and rights relating to the operation of colstrip units 3 and 4. under the terms of that agreement, each party is responsible for 15% of the total non-coal operating and construction costs of colstrip units 3 and 4, regardless of whether a particular cost is specific to colstrip unit 3 or 4 and is entitled to take up to 15% of the available generation from units 3 and 4. each party is responsible for its own coal costs. ppl montana, along with the other colstrip owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined coal quality characteristics and specifications. ppl montana, along with the other colstrip units 1 and 2 owner, has a long-term purchase and supply agreement with the current supplier for units 1 and 2, which provides these units 100% of their coal requirements through december 2014, and at least 85% of such requirements from january 2015 through december 2019. ppl montana, along with the other colstrip units 3 and 4 owners, has a long-term coal supply contract for units 3 and 4, which provides these units 100% of their coal requirements through december 2019. these units were originally built with scrubbers and ppl montana has entered into a long-term contract to purchase the limestone requirements for these units. the contract extends through december 2030. coal supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality characteristics and specifications for ppl montana's corette plant. the contracts covered 100% of the plant's coal requirements in 2012 and similar contracts are in place to supply 100% of the expected coal requirements through 2014. oil and natural gas pennsylvania ppl generation's martins creek units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas. during 2012, 100% of the physical gas requirements for the martins creek units were purchased on the spot market while oil requirements were supplied from inventory. at december 31, 2012, there were no long-term agreements for oil or natural gas for these units. short-term and long-term gas transportation contracts are in place for approximately 38% of the maximum daily requirements of the lower mt. bethel facility. during 2012, 100% of the physical gas requirements were purchased on the spot market. in 2008, ppl energyplus acquired the rights to an existing long-term tolling agreement associated with the capacity and energy of the ironwood facility. in april 2012, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of ppl energy supply completed the acquisition of the equity interests in the owner and operator of the ironwood facility. see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information. beginning in 2010, ppl energyplus has long-term transportation contracts that can deliver up to approximately 25% of ironwood's maximum daily gas requirements. daily gas requirements can also be met through a combination of short-term transportation capacity release transactions coupled with upstream supply. ppl energyplus currently has no long-term physical gas contracts. during 2012, 100% of the physical gas requirements were purchased on the spot market. nuclear the nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. ppl susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services. these contracts are expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of 2016 and unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2017. ppl susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued operation of the nuclear units. 17 federal law requires the u.s. government to provide for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel, but there is no definitive date by which a repository will be operational. as a result, it was necessary to expand susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity. to support this expansion, ppl susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage technology. the facility is modular, so that additional storage capacity can be added as needed. the facility began receiving spent nuclear fuel in 1999. ppl susquehanna estimates, under current operating conditions, that there is sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approximately 2017. if necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be discharged through the current licensed life of the plant. in 1996, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled that the nuclear waste policy act imposed on the doe an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel on or before january 31, 1998. in january 2004, ppl susquehanna filed suit in the u.s. court of federal claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the doe's breach of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel. in may 2011, the parties entered into a settlement agreement which resolved all claims of ppl susquehanna through december 2013. ppl susquehanna has received payments for claims through 2011. ppl susquehanna is eligible to receive payment of annual claims for allowed costs, as set forth in the settlement agreement, that are incurred through december 31, 2013. in exchange, ppl susquehanna has waived any claims against the united states government for costs paid or injuries sustained related to storing spent nuclear fuel at the susquehanna plant through december 31, 2013. energy marketing ppl energyplus sells the capacity and electricity produced by ppl generation subsidiaries, along with purchased power, ftrs, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances and recs in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets. purchases and sales at the wholesale level are made at competitive prices under ferc market-based prices. ppl energyplus is licensed to provide retail electric supply to customers in delaware, the district of columbia, maryland, new jersey, montana and pennsylvania and licensed to provide retail natural gas supply to customers in delaware, maryland, new jersey, new york and pennsylvania. within the constraints of its hedging policy, ppl energyplus actively manages its portfolios of energy and energy-related products to optimize their value and to limit exposure to price fluctuations. see "commodity volumetric activity" in note 19 to the financial statements for the strategies ppl energy supply employs to optimize the value of its wholesale and retail energy portfolio. competition since the early 1990s, there has been increased competition in u.s. energy markets because of federal and state competitive market initiatives. while some states, such as pennsylvania and montana, have created a competitive market for electricity generation, other states continue to consider different types of regulatory initiatives concerning competition in the power and gas industry. some states that were considering creating competitive markets have slowed their plans or postponed further consideration. in addition, states that have created competitive markets have, from time to time, considered new market rules and re-regulation measures that could result in more limited opportunities for competitive energy suppliers. interest in re-regulation, however, has slowed due to the current environment of declining power prices. as such, the markets in which ppl energy supply participates are highly competitive. ppl energy supply faces competition in wholesale markets for available energy, capacity and ancillary services. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, congestion along the power grid, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. ppl energy supply primarily competes with other electricity suppliers based on its ability to aggregate generation supply at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. competitors in wholesale power markets include regulated utilities, industrial companies, nugs, competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy marketers. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to supply segment" and ppl's and ppl energy supply's "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview" and note 15 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks faced with respect to competitive energy markets. 18 franchise and licenses see "energy marketing" above for a discussion of ppl energyplus' licenses in various states. ppl energyplus also has an export license from the doe to sell capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in canada. ppl susquehanna operates units 1 and 2 pursuant to nrc operating licenses that expire in 2042 for unit 1 and in 2044 for unit 2. in 2008, a ppl energy supply subsidiary, ppl bell bend, llc, submitted a cola to the nrc for a new nuclear generating unit (bell bend) to be built adjacent to the susquehanna plant. also in 2008, the cola was formally docketed and accepted for review by the nrc. ppl bell bend, llc does not expect to complete the cola review process with the nrc prior to 2015. see note 8 to financial statements for additional information. ppl holtwood operates the holtwood hydroelectric generating plant pursuant to a ferc-granted license that expires in 2030. in october 2009, the ferc approved the request to expand the holtwood plant. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. ppl holtwood operates the wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating plant pursuant to a ferc-granted license that expires in 2044. ppl's 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir in montana are licensed by the ferc. the thompson falls and kerr licenses expire in 2025 and 2035, the licenses for the nine missouri-madison facilities expire in 2040, and the license for the mystic facility expires in 2050. in connection with the relicensing of these generating facilities, applicable law permits the ferc to relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee or allow the u.s. government to take over the facility. if the original licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on the kerr dam license. other corporate functions (ppl) ppl services provides corporate functions such as financial, legal, human resources and information technology services. most of ppl services' costs are charged directly to the respective ppl subsidiaries for the services provided or are indirectly charged to applicable subsidiaries based on an average of the subsidiaries' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees. ppl capital funding, ppl's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of ppl and certain subsidiaries, but ppl capital funding's costs are not charged to any registrant other than ppl. ppl capital funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of lke and wpd midlands. the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other ppl capital funding securities, have been and will continue to be assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of ppl management's assessment of segment performance. ppl's recent growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through ppl capital funding, that further enables ppl to support targeted credit profiles cost effectively across all of ppl's rated companies. as a result, ppl plans to further utilize ppl capital funding in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies, as appropriate. beginning in 2013, the proceeds and the financing costs associated primarily with ppl capital funding's future securities issuances are not expected to be directly assignable or allocable to any segment. also, the costs of certain other miscellaneous corporate level activities are not charged to any subsidiaries or allocated or assigned to any segment for purposes of assessing performance by ppl management. (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) seasonality the demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. as a result, the registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or extreme winter weather make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned and the terms of contracts to purchase or sell electricity. see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - environmental matters" in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for additional information regarding climate change. 19 financial condition see the registrants' "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for this information. capital expenditure requirements see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in the registrants' "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for 2013 through 2017. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures from environmental matters. environmental matters the registrants are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. the epa is in the process of proposing and finalizing an unprecedented number of environmental regulations that will directly affect the electricity industry. these initiatives cover air, water and waste. see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in the registrants' "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information concerning environmental capital expenditures during 2012 and projected environmental capital expenditures for the years 2013-2017. also, see "environmental matters" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information. to comply with primarily air-related environmental requirements, ppl's forecast for capital expenditures reflects a best estimate projection of expenditures that may be required within the next five years. such projections are $1.1 billion for lg&amp;e, $1.2 billion for ku and $246 million for ppl energy supply. actual costs (including capital, allowance purchases and operational modifications) may be significantly lower or higher depending on the final requirements and market conditions. environmental compliance costs incurred by lg&amp;e and ku are subject to recovery through a rate recovery mechanism. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. the registrants are unable to predict the ultimate effect of evolving environmental laws and regulations upon their existing and proposed facilities and operations and competitive positions. in complying with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies involving environmental matters, including, among other things, air and water quality, ghg emissions, hazardous and solid waste management and disposal, and regulation of toxic substances, ppl's and lke's subsidiaries may be required to modify, replace or cease operating certain of their facilities. ppl's and lke's subsidiaries may also incur significant capital expenditures and operating expenses in amounts which are not now determinable but could be significant. employee relations at december 31, 2012, ppl and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees. ppl energy supply (a) 4,733 ppl electric 2,311 lke ku 931 lg&amp;e 991 lks 1,380 total lke 3,302 ppl global (primarily wpd) 6,116 ppl services and other 1,267 total ppl 17,729 (a) includes labor union employees of mechanical contracting subsidiaries, whose numbers tend to fluctuate due to the nature of this business. approximately 5,600 employees, or 48%, of ppl's domestic workforce are members of labor unions, with four ibew labor unions representing approximately 4,300 employees. the bargaining agreement with the largest ibew labor union, which expires in may 2014, covers approximately 1,500 ppl electric, 1,600 ppl energy supply and 400 other employees. approximately 700 employees of lg&amp;e and 70 employees of ku are represented by an ibew labor union. both lg&amp;e and ku have three-year labor agreements with the ibew, which expire in november 2014 and august 2015. the ku ibew agreement includes a wage reopener in 2014. approximately 70 employees of ku are represented by a united steelworkers of america (uswa) labor union, under an agreement that expires in august 2014. ppl montana's largest bargaining unit, an ibew labor union, represents approximately 260 employees at the colstrip plant. the four-year labor agreement expires in april 2016. ppl montana's second largest bargaining unit, also an ibew labor union, represents approximately 80 employees at hydroelectric facilities and the corette plant, under an agreement that expires in april 2013. 20 approximately 3,900, or 64%, of ppl's u.k. workforce are members of labor unions. wpd recognizes four unions, the largest of which represents 41% of its union workforce. wpd's electricity business agreement, which covers approximately 3,850 union employees, may be amended by agreement between wpd and the unions and is terminable with 12 months' notice by either side. available information ppl's internet website is www.pplweb.com. on the investor center page of that website, ppl provides access to all sec filings of the registrants (including annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(d) or 15(d)) free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec. additionally, the registrants' filings are available at the sec's website (www.sec.gov) and at the sec's public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, dc 20549, or by calling 1-800-sec-0330. 21 item 1a. risk factors the registrants face various risks associated with their businesses. our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. in addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 15 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. as used in this item 1a., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to ppl energy supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the supply segment discussions, or ppl electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania regulated segment discussion, or lke and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the kentucky regulated segment discussion. risks related to all segments ( ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku ) we plan to selectively pursue growth of generation, transmission and distribution capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. we plan to pursue expansion of our generation, transmission and distribution capacity over the next several years through power uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the potential construction of new power plants, the potential acquisition of existing plants, the potential construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure. we will rigorously scrutinize opportunities to expand our generating capability and may determine not to proceed with any expansion. these types of projects involve numerous risks. any planned power uprates could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs. with respect to the construction of new plants, the acquisition of existing plants, or the construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. expansion in our regulated businesses is dependent on future load or service requirements and subject to applicable regulatory processes. the success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory operating contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals. if we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project. furthermore, we might be unable to operate any new or acquired plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings. adverse conditions in the economic and financial markets in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. adverse conditions in the financial markets during 2008 and the associated contraction of liquidity in the wholesale energy markets contributed significantly to declines in wholesale energy prices, and has significantly impacted our earnings since the second half of 2008. the breadth and depth of these negative economic conditions had a wide-ranging impact on the u.s. and u.k. business environment, including our businesses. as a result of the economic downturn, demand for energy commodities declined significantly. this reduced demand continues to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets we serve (such as pjm) and our pennsylvania and kentucky utility businesses. the combination of lower demand for power and increased supply of natural gas has put downward price pressure on wholesale energy markets in general, further impacting our energy marketing results. in general, current economic and commodity market conditions will continue to challenge predictability regarding our unhedged future energy margins, liquidity and overall financial condition. our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and capital, among other things, for capital expenditures and providing collateral to support hedging in our energy marketing business. global bank credit capacity declined and the cost of renewing or establishing new credit facilities increased significantly in 2008, primarily as a result of general credit concerns nationwide, introducing uncertainties as to our businesses' ability to enter into long-term energy commitments or reliably estimate the longer-term cost and availability of credit. although bank credit conditions have improved since mid-2009, and we currently expect to have adequate access to needed credit and capital based on current conditions, deterioration in the financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. additionally, regulations to be adopted to implement the dodd-frank act and basel iii in europe may impose requirements on our businesses and the businesses of others with whom we contract such as banks or other counterparties, or simply result in increased costs to conduct our business or access sources of capital and liquidity upon which the conduct of our businesses is dependent. 22 our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of extreme weather conditions. our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold, unseasonably mild weather or severe storms occur. the patterns of these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity. operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters. weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs. storm outages and damage often either or both directly decrease revenues and increase expenses, due to reduced usage and higher restoration charges. in addition, weather and other disturbances may affect capital markets and general economic conditions and impact future growth. our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change. climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electric power. temperature increases could result in increased summer or decreased winter overall electricity consumption and precipitation changes could result in altered availability of water for hydro generation or plant cooling operations. these or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electric power, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies. reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered should consumers' preferences or market factors move toward favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electric usage. we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "legal matters," "regulatory issues" and "environmental matters - domestic" in note 15 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. we could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our bond credit ratings or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets. in the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt service and operating needs. as a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rate levels; credit rating considerations; insurance, security or collateral requirements; market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased liquidity to our regulated utility businesses. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. credit ratings assigned by moody's, fitch and s&amp;p to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. although we do not expect these ratings to limit our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs or access new long-term debt, any ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund short-term liquidity needs and access new long-term debt. see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - ratings triggers" for additional information on the impact of a downgrade in our credit rating. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. 23 we continually focus on limiting and reducing where possible our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. we provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, inflation rates, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. we may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings. under gaap, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. although no goodwill impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2012, we are unable to predict whether future impairment charges may be necessary. we also review our long-lived assets, including equity investments, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. see notes 1, 9 and 18 to the financial statements for additional information on impairment charges taken during the reporting periods. we are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future years. we may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations. in connection with various divestitures, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities and with respect to certain transactions. these indemnities and guarantees relate, among other things, to liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated the divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture. we are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution businesses. the conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties. our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses and decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial performance. operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. these events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently and lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance costs which may not be recoverable from customers. planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us fully in the event losses occur. 24 the operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risk. numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. the operation of our generation plants, including the susquehanna nuclear plant, and of our energy and fuel trading businesses, as well as our transmission and distribution operations are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive actions, principally by terrorists or vandals, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. as a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages and costs to replace or repair damaged equipment. we are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations. changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations. we are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, property, sales and use, employment-related and other taxes. we also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits. due to the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered. we cannot predict whether such tax legislation or regulation will be introduced or enacted or the effect of any such changes on our businesses. if enacted, any changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we are subject to the risk that our workforce and its knowledge base may become depleted in coming years. ppl is experiencing an increase in attrition due primarily to the number of retiring employees. over the period from 2014 through 2018, 23.5% of ppl's total workforce is projected to leave the company, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed personnel due to a declining trend in the number of available skilled workers and an increase in competition for such workers. (ppl, ppl energy supply and lke) risk related to registrant holding companies ppl's, ppl energy supply's and lke's cash flows and ability to meet their obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and ppl's ability to pay dividends, largely depends on the financial performance of their subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries. ppl, ppl energy supply and lke are holding companies and conduct their operations primarily through subsidiaries. substantially all of the consolidated assets of these registrants are held by such subsidiaries. accordingly, their cash flows and ability to meet their debt and guaranty obligations, as well as ppl's ability to pay dividends, are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or advances or repayment of loans and advances. the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due from their parents or to make any funds available for such a payment. the ability of the subsidiaries of the registrants to pay dividends or distributions to such registrants in the future will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory requirements, including restrictions on the ability of ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku to pay dividends under section 305(a) of the federal power act. because ppl, ppl energy supply and lke are holding companies, their debt and guaranty obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of their subsidiaries. therefore, ppl's, ppl energy supply's and lke's rights and the rights of their creditors, including rights of any debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of their subsidiaries, in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors. although certain agreements to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, ppl, ppl energy supply and lke and their subsidiaries retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities. in addition, if ppl elects to receive distributions of earnings from its foreign operations, ppl may incur u.s. income taxes, net of any available foreign tax credits, on such amounts. 25 (ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) risks related to domestic regulated utility operations our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to the kentucky regulated segment and the pennsylvania regulated segment. set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments. our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments. regulators may not approve the rates we request. we currently provide services to our utility customers at rates approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including those commissions referred to below. while such regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the rates that we may charge our regulated generation, transmission and distribution customers are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities. there can be no assurance that such regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments. while our rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year or based on future projected costs, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. our regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will likely require rate increase requests to the regulators. if our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation. various federal and state entities, including but not limited to the ferc, kpsc, vscc, tra and puc regulate many aspects of the domestic utility operations of ppl, including: the rates that we may charge and the terms and conditions of our service and operations; financial and capital structure matters; siting, construction and operation of facilities; mandatory reliability and safety standards and other standards of conduct; accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies; tax matters; affiliate restrictions; acquisition and disposal of utility assets and securities; and various other matters. such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties. in any rate-setting proceedings, federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our rate requests, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we seek. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. under the energy policy act of 2005, owners and operators of the bulk power electricity system are now subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the nerc and enforced by the ferc. compliance with reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures, and violations of these standards could result in substantial penalties which may not be recoverable from customers. changes in transmission and wholesale power market structures could increase costs or reduce revenues. wholesale revenues fluctuate with regional demand, fuel prices and contracted capacity. changes to transmission and wholesale power market structures and prices may occur in the future, are not predictable and may result in unforeseen effects on energy purchases and sales, transmission and related costs or revenues. these can include commercial or regulatory changes affecting power pools, exchanges or markets in which ppl participates. our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs. 26 the domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of lg&amp;e and ku) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. the completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including: approval, licensing and permitting; land acquisition and the availability of suitable land; skilled labor or equipment shortages; construction problems or delays, including disputes with third party intervenors; increases in commodity prices or labor rates; contractor performance; environmental considerations and regulations; weather and geological issues; and political, labor and regulatory developments. failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators. risks specific to kentucky regulated segment ( ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku ) the costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are significant and are subject to continuing changes. extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to lg&amp;e's and ku's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, among other business-related activities; and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted but could be material. in addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures or other restrictions. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products and demand for our services. ongoing changes in environmental regulations or their implementation requirements and our compliance strategies relating thereto entail a number of uncertainties. the environmental standards governing lg&amp;e's and ku's businesses, particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to ongoing rulemakings and other regulatory developments, legislative activities and litigation. the uncertainties associated with these developments introduce risks to our management of operations and regulatory compliance. environmental developments, including revisions to applicable standards, changes in compliance deadlines and invalidation of rules on appeal may require major changes in compliance strategies, operations or assets and adjustments to prior plans. depending on the extent, frequency and timing of such changes, the companies may be subject to inconsistent requirements under multiple regulatory programs, compressed windows for decision-making and short compliance deadlines that may require aggressive schedules for construction, permitting, and other regulatory approvals. under such circumstances, the companies may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, or increased costs of implementation. risks specific to pennsylvania regulated segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) we may be subject to higher transmission costs and other risks as a result of pjm's regional transmission expansion plan (rtep) process. 27 pjm and the ferc have the authority to require upgrades or expansion of the regional transmission grid, which can result in substantial expenditures for transmission owners. as discussed in note 8 to the financial statements, we expect to make substantial expenditures to construct the susquehanna-roseland transmission line that pjm has determined is necessary for the reliability of the regional transmission grid. although the ferc has granted our request for incentive rate treatment of such facilities, we cannot be certain that all costs that we may incur will be recoverable. in addition, the date when these facilities will be in service, which can be significantly impacted by delays related to public opposition or other factors, is subject to the outcome of future events that are not all within our control. as a result, we cannot predict the ultimate financial or operational impact of this project or other rtep projects on ppl electric. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to pennsylvania conservation and energy efficiency programs. ppl electric is subject to act 129 which contains requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposes new plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing aeps. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified dates (2011 and 2013 for phase 1 and by 2016 for phase 2). utilities not meeting these requirements of act 129 are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. ( ppl ) risks related to u.k. regulated segment our u.k. delivery business is subject to risks with respect to rate regulation and operational performance. our u.k. delivery business is rate-regulated and operates under an incentive-based regulatory framework. in addition, its ability to manage operational risk is critical to its financial performance. disruption to the distribution network could reduce profitability both directly through the higher costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that ofgem has in place relating to customer service levels. in december 2009, ofgem completed its rate review for the five-year period from april 1, 2010 through march 31, 2015, reducing regulatory rate uncertainty in the u.k. regulated segment until the next rate review which will be effective april 1, 2015. the regulated income of the u.k. regulated segment and also the rav are to some extent linked to movements in the retail price index (rpi), a measure of inflation. reductions in the rpi would adversely impact revenues and the debt-to-rav ratio. our u.k. distribution business exposes us to risks related to u.k. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and political conditions and policies of the u.k. government. these risks may reduce the results of operations from our u.k. distribution business: changes in laws or regulations relating to u.k. operations, including tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies; severe weather and natural disaster impacts on the electric sector and our assets; changes in labor relations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and in converting u.k. revenues to u.s. dollars, which can increase our expenses and/or impair our ability to meet such expenses, and difficulty moving funds out of the country in which the funds were earned; and compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws. the wpd midlands acquisition may not achieve its intended results, including anticipated cost savings, efficiencies and other benefits. 28 although we completed the wpd midlands acquisition with the expectation that it will result in various benefits, including a significant amount of cost savings and other financial and operational benefits, there can be no assurance regarding the extent to which we will be able to realize these cost-savings or other benefits. achieving the anticipated benefits, including cost savings, is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses acquired can be operated in the manner we intend. events outside of our control, including but not limited to regulatory changes or developments in the u.k., could also adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the wpd midlands acquisition. the wpd midlands acquisition exposes us to additional risks and uncertainties with respect to the acquired businesses and their operations. although the wpd midlands acquisition increased our relative investment in regulated operations, which we believe should help mitigate our exposure to downturns in the wholesale power markets, it will increase our dependence on rate-of-return regulation. the wpd businesses generally are subject to risks similar to those to which we were subject in our pre-acquisition u.k. businesses. these include: there are various changes being contemplated by ofgem to the current electricity distribution, gas transmission and gas distribution regulatory frameworks in the u.k. and there can be no assurance as to the effects such changes will have on our u.k. regulated businesses in the future, including the acquired businesses. in particular, in october 2010, ofgem announced a new regulatory framework that is expected to become effective in april 2015 for the electricity distribution sector in the u.k. the framework, known as riio (revenues = incentives + innovation + outputs), focuses on sustainability, environmental-focused output measures, promotion of low carbon energy networks and financing of new investments. the new regulatory framework is expected to have a wide-ranging effect on electricity distribution companies operating in the u.k., including changes to price controls and price review periods. our u.k. regulated businesses' compliance with this new regulatory framework may result in significant additional capital expenditures, increases in operating and compliance costs and adjustments to our pricing models. ofgem has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license. we are not currently aware of any planned modification to any of our u.k. regulated businesses distribution licenses that would result in a material adverse change to the u.k. regulated businesses and ppl. there can, however, be no assurance that a restrictive modification will not be introduced in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the u.k. regulated businesses and ppl. a failure to operate our u.k. networks properly could lead to compensation payments or penalties, or a failure to make capital expenditures in line with agreed investment programs could lead to deterioration of the network. while our u.k. regulated businesses' investment programs are targeted to maintain asset conditions over a five-year period and reduce customer interruptions and customer minutes lost over that period, no assurance can be provided that these regulatory requirements will be met. a failure by any of our u.k. regulated businesses to comply with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by ofgem that could have an adverse impact on ppl. ofgem has powers to levy fines of up to 10 percent of revenue for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may be revoked. unless terminated in the circumstances mentioned above, a distribution license continues indefinitely until revoked by ofgem following no less than 25 years' written notice. we will be subject to increased foreign currency exchange rate risks because a greater portion of our cash flows and reported earnings will be generated by our u.k. business operations. these risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value of the british pound sterling and the u.s. dollar between the time we initially invest u.s. dollars in our u.k. businesses and the time that cash is repatriated to the u.s. from the u.k., including cash flows from our u.k. businesses that may be distributed as future dividends to our shareholders or repayments of intercompany loans. in addition, our consolidated reported earnings on a u.s. gaap basis may be subject to increased earnings translation risk, which is the result of the conversion of earnings as reported in our u.k. businesses on a british pound sterling basis to a u.s. dollar basis in accordance with u.s. gaap requirements. environmental costs and liabilities associated with aspects of the acquired businesses may differ from those of our existing business. 29 risks related to supply segment ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) we face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. unlike our regulated utility businesses, our energy supply business is dependent on our ability to operate in a competitive environment and is not assured of any rate of return on capital investments through a predetermined rate structure. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. these competitive factors may negatively impact our ability to sell electricity and related products and services, as well as the prices that we may charge for such products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow our business. we sell our available energy and capacity into the competitive wholesale markets through contracts of varying duration. competition in the wholesale power markets occurs principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and availability. we believe that the commencement of commercial operation of new electricity generating facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity and the evolution of demand side management resources will continue to increase competition in the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on capacity prices and the prices we receive for electricity. we also face competition in the wholesale markets for electricity capacity and ancillary services. we primarily compete with other electricity suppliers based on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. we also compete against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to credit sources, and our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. competitors in the wholesale power markets in which ppl generation subsidiaries and ppl energyplus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators, competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities and financial institutions. adverse changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. our energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power exceed our costs to supply power, are impacted by changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, recs, electricity transmission and related congestion charges and other costs. unlike most commodities, the limited ability to store electric power requires that it must be consumed at the time of production. as a result, wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable. among the factors that influence such prices are: demand for electricity; supply and demand for electricity available from current or new generation resources; variable production costs, primarily fuel (and the associated fuel transportation costs) and emission allowance expense for the generation resources used to meet the demand for electricity; transmission capacity and service into, or out of, markets served; changes in the regulatory framework for wholesale power markets; liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, as well as general creditworthiness of key participants in the market; and weather and economic conditions impacting demand for or the price of electricity or the facilities necessary to deliver electricity. we do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price volatility. we attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity sales obligations by either reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and services through competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts. we also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements and other electricity-related commodities. however, based on economic and other considerations, we may decide not to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price risk. to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price risk, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. 30 we are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale and retail electricity markets. we purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based tariffs authorized by ferc throughout the u.s. and also enter into short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price fluctuations. if we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay damages. these damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of any undelivered capacity or electricity. depending on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be significant. extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, environmental compliance costs, transmission disruptions, and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and electricity. our wholesale power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post collateral for the benefit of our counterparties if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. we currently believe that we have sufficient credit to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these power contracts. however, our obligation to post collateral could exceed the amount of our facilities or our ability to increase our facilities could be limited by financial markets or other factors. see note 7 to the financial statements for a discussion of ppl's credit facilities. we also face credit risk that parties with whom we contract in both the wholesale and retail markets will default in their performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the time of contract. whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these risks using various means, including agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract price in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. however, there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance risk, including bankruptcy, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our obligations to other parties, which could in turn subject us to claims for damages. the load following contracts that ppl energyplus is awarded do not provide for specific levels of load and actual load significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy margins. we generally hedge our load following obligations with energy purchases from third parties, and to a lesser extent with our own generation. if the actual load is significantly lower than the expected load, we may be required to resell power at a lower price than was contracted for to supply the load obligation, resulting in a financial loss. alternatively, a significant increase in load could adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of the load following contracts to provide the energy necessary to fulfill increased demand at the contract price, which could be lower than the cost to procure additional energy on the open market. therefore, any significant decrease or increase in load compared with our forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we may experience disruptions in our fuel supply, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our generation facilities. we purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. disruption in the delivery of fuel and other products consumed during the production of electricity (such as coal, natural gas, oil, water, uranium, lime, limestone and other chemicals), including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. unforeseen changes in the price of coal and natural gas could cause us to incur excess coal inventories and contract termination costs. extraordinarily low natural gas prices during 2012 caused natural gas to be the more cost competitive fuel compared to coal for generating electricity. because we enter into guaranteed supply contracts to provide for the amount of coal needed to operate our base load coal-fired generating facilities, we may experience periods where we hold excess amounts of coal if fuel pricing results in our reducing or idling coal-fired generating facilities in favor of operating available alternative natural gas-fired generating facilities. in addition, we may incur costs to terminate supply contracts for coal in excess of our generating requirements. our risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices, interest rates and counterparty credit and non-performance risks may not work as planned, and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs. 31 we actively manage the market risk inherent in our generation and energy marketing activities, as well as our debt and counterparty credit positions. we have implemented procedures to monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs, including independent validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, portfolio stress tests, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics. nonetheless, our risk management programs may not work as planned. for example, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management calculations. additionally, unforeseen market disruptions could decrease market depth and liquidity, negatively impacting our ability to enter into new transactions. we enter into financial contracts to hedge commodity basis risk, and as a result are exposed to the risk that the correlation between delivery points could change with actual physical delivery. similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not designed to address. as a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events result in greater losses or costs than our risk models predict or greater volatility in our earnings and financial position. in addition, our trading, marketing and hedging activities are exposed to counterparty credit risk and market liquidity risk. we have adopted a credit risk management policy and program to evaluate counterparty credit risk. however, if counterparties fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices. in that event, our financial results are likely to be adversely affected. our costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital expenditures for pollution control improvements that, if delayed, would adversely affect our profitability and liquidity. our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection. to comply with existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control measures we may take, we have spent and expect to spend substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and compliance. in order to comply with existing and previously proposed federal and state environmental laws and regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-fired plants, since 2005 ppl has spent more than $1.6 billion to install scrubbers and other pollution control equipment (primarily aimed at sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxides with co-benefits for mercury emissions reduction) in its competitive generation fleet. many states and environmental groups have challenged certain federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict. as a result, state and federal regulations have been adopted that would impose more stringent restrictions than are currently in effect, which could require us significantly to increase capital expenditures for additional pollution control equipment. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for our planned capital projects which are necessary to our business. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted, reduced or subjected to additional costs. furthermore, at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. for more information regarding environmental matters, including existing and proposed federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations to which we are subject, see "environmental matters - domestic" in note 15 to the financial statements. we rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control to deliver our wholesale electricity. if transmission is disrupted, or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver power may be hindered. we depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell in the wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electricity generation facilities. if transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by isos and rtos, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or we may be unable to sell products at the most favorable terms. the ferc has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that transmission capacity will not be available in the amounts we require. we cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether isos and rtos in applicable markets will efficiently operate transmission networks and provide related services. 32 despite federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or prevent or delay operation of our facilities. our generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market. generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the ferc. the ferc has authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices. the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates. any reduction by the ferc in the rates we may receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations. see "ferc market-based rate authority" in note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the ferc's market-based rate authority program. in addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals. if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to additional costs. if market deregulation is reversed or discontinued, our business prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in some markets, state legislators, government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of these markets that have previously been competitive or permit electricity delivery companies to construct, contract for, or acquire generating facilities. the isos that oversee the transmission systems in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address extremely high prices in the power markets. these types of price limitations and other mechanisms may reduce profits that our wholesale power marketing and trading business would have realized under competitive market conditions absent such limitations and mechanisms. although we generally expect electricity markets to continue to be competitive, other proposals to re-regulate our industry may be made, and legislative or other actions affecting the electric power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or reversed in states in which we currently, or may in the future, operate. see "new jersey capacity legislation" and "maryland capacity order" in note 15 to the financial statements. changes in technology may negatively impact the value of our power plants. a basic premise of our generation business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at relatively low prices. there are alternate technologies to produce electricity, most notably fuel cells, micro turbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells, the development of which has been expanded due to global climate change concerns. research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in alternate technologies. it is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternate methods of electricity production to a level that is equal to or below that of certain central station production. also, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators. these alternative energy sources could result in a decline to the dispatch and capacity factors of our plants. as a result of all of these factors, the value of our generation facilities could be significantly reduced. we are subject to certain risks associated with nuclear generation, including the risk that our susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to increased security or safety requirements that would increase capital and operating expenditures, uncertainties regarding spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its licensed life. nuclear generation accounted for about 31% of our 2012 generation output. the risks of nuclear generation generally include: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. the licenses for our two nuclear units expire in 2042 and 2044. see note 21 to the financial statements for additional information on the aro related to the decommissioning. 33 the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, including security, safety and employee-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. in the event of noncompliance, the nrc has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. in addition, revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital or operating expenditures at our susquehanna nuclear plant. there also remains substantial

subsidiary, which statements reflect total revenues of $494 million for the period november 1, 2010 (date of acquisition) to december 31, 2010. those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for lke, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes

corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2012, based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (the coso criteria). ppl corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting at item 9a. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. in our opinion, ppl corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2012 based on the coso criteria. we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated balance sheets of ppl corporation and subsidiaries as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash

(ppl and ppl energy supply) in april 2012, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of ppl energy supply completed the ironwood acquisition. see note 10 for additional information. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lke is a holding company with cost-based rate-regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, lg&amp;e and ku, and is subject to puhca. lg&amp;e and ku are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. lg&amp;e also engages in the regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. lg&amp;e and ku maintain their separate identities and serve customers in kentucky under their respective names. ku also serves customers in virginia (under the old dominion power name) and in tennessee. (lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lke's, lg&amp;e's and ku's financial statements and related financial and operating data include the periods before and after ppl's acquisition of lke on november 1, 2010 and have been segregated to present pre-acquisition activity as the predecessor and post-acquisition activity as the successor. certain accounting and presentation methods were changed to acceptable alternatives to conform to ppl's accounting policies, and the cost bases of certain assets and liabilities were changed as of november 1, 2010 as a result of the application of push-down accounting. consequently, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the successor periods are not comparable to the predecessor periods; however, the core operations of lke, lg&amp;e and ku have not changed as a result of the acquisition. 245 (ppl and ppl energy supply) ppl generation owns and operates a portfolio of competitive domestic power generating assets. these power plants are located in pennsylvania and montana and use well-diversified fuel sources including coal, uranium, natural gas, oil and water. ppl energyplus sells electricity produced by ppl generation subsidiaries, participates in wholesale market load-following auctions, and markets various energy products and commodities such as: capacity, transmission, ftrs, coal, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances, recs and other commodities in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets, primarily in the northeastern and northwestern u.s. (ppl energy supply) in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its membership interest in ppl global, representing all of the outstanding membership interest of ppl global, to ppl energy supply's parent, ppl energy funding. the distribution was made based on the book value of the assets and liabilities of ppl global with financial effect as of january 1, 2011. see note 9 for additional information. (ppl, ppl energy supply and lke) "income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes)" on the statements of income includes the activities of various businesses that were sold or distributed. see note 9 for additional information. the statements of cash flows do not separately report the cash flows of the discontinued operations, except for the lke predecessor period, which separately discloses these cash flows within operating, investing and financing activities, consistent with lke's pre-acquisition accounting policy. (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric is a cost-based rate-regulated subsidiary of ppl. ppl electric's principal business is the regulated transmission and distribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central pennsylvania and the regulated supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a plr. (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the financial statements of the registrants include each company's own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest. entities for which a controlling financial interest is not demonstrated through voting interests are evaluated based on accounting guidance for vies. the registrants consolidate a vie when they are determined to have a controlling interest in the vie, and thus are the primary beneficiary of the entity. for ppl and ppl energy supply, see note 22 for information regarding a consolidated vie. investments in entities in which a company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method. all other investments are carried at cost or fair value. all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. any noncontrolling interests are reflected in the financial statements. the financial statements of ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku include their share of any undivided interests in jointly owned facilities, as well as their share of the related operating costs of those facilities. see note 14 for additional information. (ppl) ppl consolidates wpd, including wpd midlands, on a one-month lag. material intervening events, such as debt issuances that occur in the lag period, are recognized in the current period financial statements. events that are significant but not material are disclosed. 246 regulation (ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku are cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulators to enable ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. rates are generally established based on a historical test period adjusted to exclude unusual or nonrecurring items. as a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by gaap and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. the effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. in certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. the accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the ferc or the applicable state regulatory commissions. see note 6 for additional details regarding regulatory matters. (ppl) wpd operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under distribution licenses granted by ofgem. electricity distribution revenues are set by ofgem every five years through price control reviews that are not directly based on cost recovery. the price control formula that governs wpd's allowed revenue is designed to provide economic incentives to minimize operating, capital and financing costs. as a result, wpd is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by gaap and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities. accounting records (ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the system of accounts for domestic regulated entities is maintained in accordance with the uniform system of accounts prescribed by the ferc and adopted by the applicable state regulatory commissions. (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. loss accruals potential losses are accrued when (1) information is available that indicates it is "probable" that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. accounting guidance defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event or events are likely to occur." the registrants continuously assess potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events. loss accruals for environmental remediation are discounted when appropriate. the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded, unless realization is assured. changes in classification the classification of certain amounts in the 2011 and 2010 financial statements have been changed to conform to the current presentation. the changes in classification did not affect the registrants' net income or equity. 247 comprehensive income (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) comprehensive income, which includes net income and oci, is shown on the statements of comprehensive income. aoci, which is presented on the balance sheets of ppl and included in member's equity on the balance sheets of ppl energy supply and lke, consisted of the following after-tax gains (losses).

(a predecessor period). lg&amp;e had no aoci balances at december 31, 2010, 2011 or 2012 (successor periods). during the ten months ended october 31, 2010 (a predecessor period), lg&amp;e had $10 million of gains on qualifying derivatives that were recorded in oci. ku had no aoci balances at december 31, 2009 (a predecessor period), 2010 or 2011 (successor periods). ku had an aoci balance that was a gain of $1 million at december 31, 2012 (a successor period) related to an equity investee's aoci. ku recorded $2 million of losses related to an equity investee's oci during the ten months ended october 31, 2010 (a predecessor period), which were eliminated with the effect of the ppl acquisition. 248 earnings per share (ppl) eps is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method for computing eps that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common shareowners. share-based payment awards that provide recipients a non-forfeitable right to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities. price risk management (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) energy and energy-related contracts are used to hedge the variability of expected cash flows associated with the generating units and marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes. interest rate contracts are used to hedge exposures to changes in the fair value of debt instruments and to hedge exposures to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing floating-rate debt instruments or forecasted fixed-rate issuances of debt. foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign currency exchange exposures, primarily associated with ppl's investments in u.k. subsidiaries. similar derivatives may receive different accounting treatment, depending on management's intended use and documentation. certain energy and energy-related contracts meet the definition of a derivative, while others do not meet the definition of a derivative because they lack a notional amount or a net settlement provision. in cases where there is no net settlement provision, markets are periodically assessed to determine whether market mechanisms have evolved that would facilitate net settlement. certain derivative energy contracts have been excluded from the requirements of derivative accounting treatment because they meet the definition of npns. these contracts are accounted for using accrual accounting. all other contracts that have been classified as derivative contracts are reflected on the balance sheet at their fair value. these contracts are recorded as "price risk management assets" and "price risk management liabilities" on the balance sheets. the portion of derivative positions that deliver within a year are included in "current assets" and "current liabilities," while the portion of derivative positions that deliver beyond a year are recorded in "other noncurrent assets" and "deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities." energy and energy-related contracts are assigned a strategy and accounting classification. processes exist that allow for subsequent review and validation of the contract information. these strategies are discussed in more detail in note 19. the accounting department provides the traders and the risk management department with guidelines on appropriate accounting classifications for various contract types and strategies. some examples of these guidelines include, but are not limited to: physical coal, limestone, lime, uranium, electric transmission, gas transportation, gas storage and renewable energy credit contracts are not derivatives due to the lack of net settlement provisions. only contracts where physical delivery is deemed probable throughout the entire term of the contract can qualify for npns. physical transactions that permit cash settlement and financial transactions do not qualify for npns because physical delivery cannot be asserted; however, these transactions can receive cash flow hedge treatment if they lock in the future cash flows for energy-related commodities. certain purchased option contracts or net purchased option collars may receive hedge accounting treatment. those that are not eligible are recorded at fair value through earnings. derivative transactions that do not qualify for npns or hedge accounting treatment are recorded at fair value through earnings. a similar process is also followed by the treasury department as it relates to interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. examples of accounting guidelines provided to the treasury department staff include, but are not limited to: transactions to lock in an interest rate prior to a debt issuance can be designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent the forecasted debt issuances remain probable of occurring. cross-currency transactions to hedge interest and principal repayments can be designated as cash flow hedges. transactions entered into to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of existing debt can be designated as fair value hedges. transactions entered into to hedge the value of a net investment of foreign operations can be designated as net investment hedges. 249 derivative transactions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to fair value through earnings. these transactions generally include foreign currency swaps and options to hedge gbp earnings translation risk associated with ppl's u.k. subsidiaries that report their financial statements in gbp. as such, these transactions reduce earnings volatility due solely to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. derivative transactions may be marked to fair value through regulatory assets/liabilities if approved by the appropriate regulatory body. these transactions generally include the effect of interest rate swaps that are included in customer rates. cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing activities on the statements of cash flows, depending on the underlying nature of the hedged items. ppl and its subsidiaries have elected not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements. ppl energy supply reflects its net realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in "net energy trading margins" on the statements of income. see notes 18 and 19 for additional information on derivatives. (ppl and ppl electric) to meet its obligation as a plr to its customers, ppl electric has entered into certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative. however, these contracts qualify for npns. see notes 18 and 19 for additional information. revenue utility revenue (ppl) for the years ended december 31, the statements of income "utility" line item contains rate-regulated revenue from the following: 2012 2011 2010 domestic electric and gas revenue (a) $ 4,519 $ 4,674 $ 2,941 u.k. electric revenue (b) 2,289 1,618 727 total $ 6,808 $ 6,292 $ 3,668 (a) represents revenue from regulated generation, transmission and/or distribution in pennsylvania, kentucky, virginia and tennessee, including regulated wholesale revenue. 2010 includes two months of revenue for lke. (b) represents electric distribution revenue from the operation of wpd's distribution networks. 2011 includes eight months of revenue for wpd midlands. revenue recognition (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) operating revenues, except for certain energy and energy-related contracts that meet the definition of derivative instruments and "energy-related businesses," are recorded based on energy deliveries through the end of the calendar month. unbilled retail revenues result because customers' meters are read and bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than all being read at the end of the month. unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kwh by the estimated average cents per kwh. unbilled wholesale energy revenues are recorded at month-end to reflect estimated amounts until actual dollars and mwhs are confirmed and invoiced. any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month. 250 certain ppl subsidiaries participate primarily in the pjm rto, as well as in other rtos and isos. in pjm, ppl energyplus is a marketer, a load-serving entity and a seller for ppl energy supply's generation subsidiaries. a function of interchange accounting is to match participants' mwh entitlements (generation plus scheduled bilateral purchases) against their mwh obligations (load plus scheduled bilateral sales) during every hour of every day. if the net result during any given hour is an entitlement, the participant is credited with a spot-market sale to the rto at the respective market price for that hour; if the net result is an obligation, the participant is charged with a spot-market purchase at the respective market price for that hour. ppl energy supply records the hourly net sales in its statements of income as "wholesale energy marketing" if in a net sales position and "energy purchases" if in a net purchase position. (ppl) wpd's revenue is primarily from charges to suppliers to use its distribution system to deliver electricity to the end-user. wpd's allowed revenue is not dependent on volume delivered over the five-year price control period. however, in any fiscal period, wpd's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a given period. under recoveries are recovered and recorded in the next regulatory year. over recoveries are reflected in the current period as a liability and are not included in revenue. (ppl and ppl energy supply) ppl energy supply records non-derivative energy marketing activity in the period when the energy is delivered. generally, sales contracts held for non-trading purposes are reported gross on the statements of income within "wholesale energy marketing" and "unregulated retail electric and gas." however, non-trading physical sales and purchases of electricity at major market delivery points (which is any delivery point with liquid pricing available, such as the pricing hub for pjm west), are netted and reported in the statements of income within "wholesale energy marketing" or "energy purchases," depending on the net hourly position. certain energy and energy-related contracts that meet the definition of derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue or expense (see note 19), unless hedge accounting is applied. if derivatives meet cash flow hedging criteria, changes in fair value are recorded in aoci. derivative and non-derivative contracts that are designated as proprietary trading activities are reported net on the statements of income within "net energy trading margins." "energy-related businesses" revenue primarily includes revenue from the mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries. the mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries record revenue from construction contracts on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, measured by the actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost for each contract. accordingly, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded within "unbilled revenues" on the balance sheets, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are recorded within "other current liabilities" on the balance sheets. the amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings was $12 million and $15 million at december 31, 2012 and 2011, and the amount of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings was $70 million and $59 million at december 31, 2012 and 2011. accounts receivable (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) accounts receivable are reported on the balance sheets at the gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts. accounts receivable that are acquired are initially recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. see note 10 for information related to the acquisitions of wpd midlands and lke. (ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric) in accordance with a puc-approved purchase of accounts receivable program, ppl electric purchases certain accounts receivable from alternative suppliers (including ppl energyplus) at a nominal discount, which reflects a provision for uncollectible accounts. the alternative suppliers have no continuing involvement or interest in the purchased accounts receivable. the purchased accounts receivable are initially recorded at fair value using a market approach based on the purchase price paid and are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. ppl electric receives a nominal fee for administering its program. during 2012, 2011 and 2010, ppl electric purchased $848 million, $875 million and $617 million of accounts receivable from unaffiliated third parties. during 2012, 2011 and 2010, ppl electric purchased $313 million, $264 million and $215 million of accounts receivable from ppl energyplus. 251 allowance for doubtful accounts (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) accounts receivable collectability is evaluated using a combination of factors, including past due status based on contractual terms, trends in write-offs, the age of the receivable, counterparty creditworthiness and economic conditions. specific events, such as bankruptcies, are also considered. adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made when necessary based on the results of analysis, the aging of receivables and historical and industry trends. accounts receivable are written off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible. recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when it is known they will be received. the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts were: additions balance at charged to balance at beginning of period charged to income other accounts deductions (a) end of period ppl 2012 $ 54 $ 55 (c) $ 45 $ 64 2011 55 65 (c) 66 (d) 54 2010 37 42 (b) $ 7 (b) (e) 31 55 (b) ppl energy supply 2012 $ 15 $ 12 (c) $ 4 $ 23 2011 20 14 (c) 19 (d) 15 2010 21 1 2 20 ppl electric 2012 $ 17 $ 32 $ 31 $ 18 2011 17 33 33 17 2010 16 30 29 17 lke 2012 - successor $ 17 $ 9 $ 7 $ 19 2011 - successor 17 15 15 17 2010 - successor 10 $ 7 (e) 17 2010 - predecessor 4 10 10 4 lg&amp;e 2012 - successor $ 2 $ 2 $ 3 $ 1 2011 - successor 2 5 5 2 2010 - successor 1 $ 2 (e) 1 2 2010 - predecessor 2 4 4 2 ku 2012 - successor $ 2 $ 4 $ 4 $ 2 2011 - successor 6 6 10 2 2010 - successor 1 $ 6 (e) 1 6 2010 - predecessor 3 6 6 3 (a) primarily related to uncollectible accounts written off. (b) includes amounts associated with lke activity since the november 1, 2010 acquisition date. see note 10 for additional information related to the acquisition of lke. (c) includes amounts related to the smgt bankruptcy. see note 15 for additional information. (d) includes amounts related to the june 2011, ferc approved settlement agreement between ppl and the california iso related to the sales made to the california iso during the period october 2000 through june 2001 that were not paid to ppl subsidiaries. therefore, the receivable and the related allowance for doubtful accounts were reversed and the settlement recorded. (e) primarily related to capital projects, thus the provision was recorded as an adjustment to construction work in progress. cash (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) cash equivalents all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. 252 restricted cash and cash equivalents bank deposits and other cash equivalents that are restricted by agreement or that have been clearly designated for a specific purpose are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents. the change in restricted cash and cash equivalents is reported as an investing activity on the statements of cash flows. on the balance sheets, the current portion of restricted cash and cash equivalents is shown as "restricted cash and cash equivalents" for ppl and ppl energy supply and included in "other current assets" for ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku while the noncurrent portion is included in "other noncurrent assets" for all registrants. at december 31, the balances of restricted cash and cash equivalents included the following. ppl ppl energy supply ppl electric lke lg&amp;e 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 margin deposits posted to counterparties $ 43 $ 137 $ 43 $ 137 cash collateral posted to counterparties 32 29 $ 32 $ 29 $ 32 $ 29 low carbon network fund (a) 14 9 captive insurance reserves (b) 6 6 funds deposited with a trustee (c) 13 12 $ 13 $ 12 ironwood debt service reserves 17 17 other 10 16 3 8 1 total $ 135 $ 209 $ 63 $ 145 $ 13 $ 13 $ 32 $ 29 $ 32 $ 29 (a) funds received by wpd, which are to be spent on approved initiatives to support a low carbon environment. (b) funds required by law to be held by wpd's captive insurance company to meet claims. (c) funds deposited with a trustee to defease ppl electric's 1945 first mortgage bonds. fair value measurements (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the registrants value certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value. generally, the most significant fair value measurements relate to price risk management assets and liabilities, investments in securities including investments in the ndt funds and defined benefit plans, and cash and cash equivalents. ppl and its subsidiaries use, as appropriate, a market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models) and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) to measure the fair value of an asset or liability. these valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. these inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. the registrants classify fair value measurements within one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy. the level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. level 3 - unobservable inputs that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to measure the asset or liability at fair value. assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment that considers factors specific to the asset or liability. as such, the registrants' assessment of the significance of a particular input may affect how the assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy. 253 investments (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) generally, the original maturity date of an investment and management's intent and ability to sell an investment prior to its original maturity determine the classification of investments as either short-term or long-term. investments that would otherwise be classified as short-term, but are restricted as to withdrawal or use for other than current operations or are clearly designated for expenditure in the acquisition or construction of noncurrent assets or for the liquidation of long-term debts, are classified as long-term. short-term investments short-term investments generally include certain deposits as well as securities that are considered highly liquid or provide for periodic reset of interest rates. investments with original maturities greater than three months and less than a year, as well as investments with original maturities of greater than a year that management has the ability and intent to sell within a year, are included in "short-term investments" or "other current assets" on the balance sheets. investments in debt and equity securities investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and measured at amortized cost when there is an intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. debt and equity securities held principally to capitalize on fluctuations in their value with the intention of selling them in the near-term are classified as trading. all other investments in debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale. both trading and available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. the specific identification method is used to calculate realized gains and losses on debt and equity securities. any unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. the criteria for determining whether a decline in fair value of a debt security is other than temporary and whether the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings or reported in oci require that when a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and: there is an intent or a requirement to sell the security before recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized currently in earnings; or there is no intent or requirement to sell the security before recovery, the portion of the other-than-temporary impairment that is considered a credit loss is recognized currently in earnings and the remainder of the other-than-temporary impairment is reported in oci, net of tax; or there is no intent or requirement to sell the security before recovery and there is no credit loss, the unrealized loss is reported in oci, net of tax. unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale equity securities are reported, net of tax, in oci. when an equity security's decline in fair value below amortized cost is determined to be an other-than-temporary impairment, the unrealized loss is recognized currently in earnings. see notes 18 and 23 for additional information on investments in debt and equity securities. equity method investment (ppl, lke and ku) investments in entities over which ppl, lke and ku have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reported in "other investments" on ppl's balance sheet and in "investments" on lke's and ku's balance sheets. in accordance with the accounting guidance for equity method investments, the recoverability of the investment is periodically assessed. if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an impairment evaluation, the fair value of the investment is assessed. the difference between the carrying amount of the investment and its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss when the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary and such loss is included in "other-than-temporary impairments" on the statements of income. ku owns 20% of the common stock of eei, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. ku's direct exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with eei is generally limited to the value of its investment. during 2012, ku recorded gains (losses) of $(8) million from its share of eei's operating results. in december 2012, ku concluded that an other-than-temporary decline in the value of its investment in eei had occurred. ku recorded an impairment charge of $25 million ($15 million, after-tax) which reduced the investment balance to zero, the estimated fair value at december 31, 2012. see note 18 for additional information. 254 cost method investment (lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lg&amp;e and ku each have an investment in ovec, which is accounted for using the cost method. the investment is recorded in "investments" on the lke and ku balance sheets, in "other noncurrent assets" on the lg&amp;e balance sheets and in "other investments" on the ppl balance sheets. lg&amp;e and ku and ten other electric utilities are equity owners of ovec. ovec's power is currently supplied to lg&amp;e and ku and 11 other companies affiliated with the various owners. lg&amp;e and ku own 5.63% and 2.5% of ovec's common stock. pursuant to a power purchase agreement, lg&amp;e and ku are contractually entitled to their ownership percentage of ovec's output, which is approximately 134 mw for lg&amp;e and approximately 60 mw for ku. lg&amp;e's and ku's combined investment in ovec is not significant. the direct exposure to loss as a result of lg&amp;e's and ku's involvement with ovec is generally limited to the value of their investments; however, lg&amp;e and ku may be conditionally responsible for a pro-rata share of certain ovec obligations. as part of ppl's acquisition of lke, the value of the power purchase contract was recorded as an intangible asset with an offsetting regulatory liability, both of which are being amortized using the units-of-production method until march 2026, the expiration date of the agreement. see notes 15 and 20 for additional discussion on the power purchase agreement. long-lived and intangible assets property, plant and equipment (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) pp&amp;e is recorded at original cost, unless impaired. pp&amp;e acquired in a business combination is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition. if impaired, the asset is written down to fair value at that time, which becomes the new cost basis of the asset. original cost includes material, labor, contractor costs, certain overheads and financing costs, where applicable. the cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. the registrants record costs associated with planned major maintenance projects in the period in which the costs are incurred. no costs associated with planned major maintenance projects are accrued in advance of the period in which the work is performed. lg&amp;e and ku accrue costs of removal net of estimated salvage value through depreciation, which is included in the calculation of customer rates over the assets' depreciable lives in accordance with regulatory practices. cost of removal amounts accrued through depreciation rates are accumulated as a regulatory liability until the removal costs are incurred. see "asset retirement obligations" below and note 6 for additional information. (ppl and ppl energy supply) the original cost for the pp&amp;e acquired in the ironwood acquisition is its fair value on april 13, 2012. see note 10 for additional information on the acquisition. (ppl) the original cost for the pp&amp;e acquired in the wpd midlands acquisition is its fair value on april 1, 2011, which approximated rav as of the acquisition date. see note 10 for additional information on the acquisition. (ppl, ppl electric, lke and ku) afudc is capitalized as part of the construction costs for cost-based rate-regulated projects for which a return on such costs is recovered after the project is placed in service. the debt component of afudc is credited to "interest expense" and the equity component is credited to "other income (expense) - net" on the statements of income. lke and ku have not recorded significant afudc as a return has been provided during the construction period for most projects. (ppl and ppl energy supply) nuclear fuel-related costs, including fuel, conversion, enrichment, fabrication and assemblies, are capitalized as pp&amp;e. such costs are amortized as the fuel is spent using the units-of-production method and included in "fuel" on the statements of income. ppl energy supply capitalizes interest costs as part of construction costs. capitalized interest, excluding afudc for ppl, is as follows. 255 ppl ppl energy supply 2012 $ 53 $ 47 2011 51 47 2010 30 33 depreciation (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) depreciation is recorded over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods. when a component of pp&amp;e that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. when all or a significant portion of an operating unit that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired or sold, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by regulators. following are the weighted-average rates of depreciation at december 31. 2012 ppl energy ppl ppl supply electric lke lg&amp;e ku regulated utility plant 3.12 2.57 4.39 4.91 4.06 non-regulated pp&amp;e - generation 3.05 3.05 2011 ppl energy ppl ppl supply electric lke lg&amp;e ku regulated utility plant 3.03 2.49 4.54 5.11 4.17 non-regulated pp&amp;e - generation 2.88 2.88 (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the kpsc approved new lower depreciation rates for lg&amp;e and ku as part of the rate-case settlement agreement reached in november 2012. the new rates became effective january 1, 2013 and will result in lower depreciation of approximately $19 million ($9 million for lg&amp;e and $10 million for ku) in 2013, exclusive of net additions to pp&amp;e. (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. other acquired intangible assets are initially measured based on their fair value. intangibles that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used. costs incurred to obtain an initial license and renew or extend terms of licenses are capitalized as intangible assets. when determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including intangible assets that are renewed or extended, ppl and its subsidiaries consider the expected use of the asset; the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life of the intangible asset may relate; legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life; the company's historical experience as evidence of its ability to support renewal or extension; the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors; and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. 256 ppl and ppl energy supply account for recs as intangible assets. ppl and ppl energy supply buy and/or sell recs and also create recs through owned renewable energy generation facilities. in any period, ppl and ppl energy supply can be a net purchaser or seller of recs depending on their contractual obligations to purchase or deliver recs and the production of recs from their renewable energy generation facilities. the carrying value of recs created from their renewable energy generation facilities is initially recorded at zero value and purchased recs are initially recorded based on their purchase price. when recs are consumed to satisfy an obligation to deliver recs to meet a state's renewable portfolio standard obligation or when recs are sold to third parties, they are removed from the balance sheet at their weighted-average carrying value. since the economic benefits of recs are not diminished until they are consumed, recs are not amortized; rather, they are expensed when consumed or a gain or loss is recognized when sold. such expense is included in "energy purchases" on the statements of income. gains and losses on the sale of recs are included in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku account for emission allowances as intangible assets. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku are allocated emission allowances by states based on their generation facilities' historical emissions experience, and have purchased emission allowances generally when it is expected that additional allowances will be needed. the carrying value of allocated emission allowances is initially recorded at zero value and purchased allowances are initially recorded based on their purchase price. when consumed or sold, emission allowances are removed from the balance sheet at their weighted-average carrying value. since the economic benefits of emission allowances are not diminished until they are consumed, emission allowances are not amortized; rather, they are expensed when consumed or a gain or loss is recognized when sold. such expense is included in "fuel" on the statements of income. gains and losses on the sale of emission allowances are included in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income. asset impairment (excluding investments) the registrants review long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. see note 18 for a discussion of impairments related to certain intangible assets. a long-lived asset classified as held and used is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if impaired, the asset's carrying value is written down to its fair value. see note 15 for a discussion of the corette coal-fired plant in montana which was determined to not be impaired. a long-lived asset classified as held for sale is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. if impaired, the asset's (disposal group's) carrying value is written down to its fair value less cost to sell. see notes 9 and 18 for a discussion of impairment charges recorded associated with long-lived assets classified as held for sale. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value. additionally, goodwill must be tested for impairment in circumstances when a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of. ppl's, ppl energy supply's, lke's, lg&amp;e's and ku's reporting units are at the operating segment level. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill must be calculated in the same manner as goodwill in a business combination. the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. the goodwill recognized upon the acquisition of lke, although entirely recorded at lg&amp;e and ku, was assigned for impairment testing by ppl to its reporting units expected to benefit from the acquisition, which were the kentucky regulated segment and the supply segment. the goodwill recognized upon the acquisition of wpd midlands was assigned for impairment testing by ppl to its u.k. regulated segment. see note 10 for additional information regarding the acquisition. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku tested the goodwill of all of their reporting units for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2012 and no impairment was recognized. 257 asset retirement obligations ppl and its subsidiaries record liabilities to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. initially, this obligation is measured at fair value and offset with an increase in the value of the capitalized asset, which is depreciated over the asset's useful life. until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased to reflect changes in the obligation due to the passage of time through the recognition of accretion expense classified within "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income. the accretion and depreciation related to lg&amp;e's and ku's aros are offset with a regulatory credit on the income statement, such that there is no earnings impact. the regulatory asset created by the regulatory credit is relieved when the aro is settled. estimated aro costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the aro and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the aro. any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. see note 21 for additional information on aros. compensation and benefits defined benefits (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) certain ppl subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. an asset or liability is recorded to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to oci or, for lg&amp;e, ku and ppl electric, to regulatory assets or liabilities. consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the balance sheets. the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is calculated by rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions, disbursements and long-term expected return on investments. one-fifth of the difference between the actual value and the expected value is added (or subtracted if negative) to the expected value to determine the new market-related value. ppl uses an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans. under the accelerated method, actuarial gains and losses in excess of 30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over one-half of the expected average remaining service of active plan participants. actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets and less than 30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected average remaining service period of active plan participants. see note 13 for a discussion of defined benefits. stock-based compensation (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric and lke) ppl has several stock-based compensation plans for purposes of granting stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to certain employees as well as stock units and restricted stock units to directors. ppl grants most stock-based awards in the first quarter of each year. ppl and its subsidiaries recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the fair value method. stock options that vest in installments are valued as a single award. ppl grants stock options with an exercise price that is not less than the fair value of ppl's common stock on the date of grant. see note 12 for a discussion of stock-based compensation. all awards are recorded as equity or a liability on the balance sheets. stock-based compensation is primarily included in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income. stock-based compensation expense for ppl energy supply, ppl electric and lke includes an allocation of ppl services' expense. other debt issuance costs (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) debt issuance costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the interest method or another method, generally straight-line, if the results obtained are not materially different than those that would result from the interest method. 258 income taxes (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated u.s. federal income tax return. prior to ppl's acquisition of lke, lke and its subsidiaries were included in e.on us investments corp.'s consolidated u.s. federal income tax return. significant management judgment is required in developing the registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns and the determination of deferred tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowances. significant management judgment is also required to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain tax position. the registrants use a two-step process to evaluate tax positions. the first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. this determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. the second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. the benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%. the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements of the registrants in future periods. deferred income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. the registrants record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. the registrants consider the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in initially recording and subsequently reevaluating the need for valuation allowances. if the registrants determine that they are able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of recorded net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. likewise, if the registrants determine that they are not able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. the registrants defer investment tax credits when the credits are utilized and amortize the deferred amounts over the average lives of the related assets. the registrants recognize interest and penalties in "income taxes" on their statements of income. see note 5 for additional discussion regarding income taxes. (ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the provision for ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku's deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the regulators. the difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under gaap is deferred and included on the balance sheet in noncurrent "regulatory assets" or "regulatory liabilities." ( ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the income tax provision for ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku is calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing agreement which provides that taxable income be calculated as if ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e, ku and any domestic subsidiaries each filed a separate return. tax benefits are not shared between companies. the entity that generates a tax benefit is the entity that is entitled to the tax benefit. the effect of ppl filing a consolidated tax return is taken into account in the settlement of current taxes and the recognition of deferred taxes. at december 31, the following intercompany tax receivables (payables) were recorded. 259 2012 2011 ppl energy supply $ (38) $ (50) ppl electric 22 22 lke (12) 3 lg&amp;e 5 4 ku (15) 5 taxes, other than income (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the registrants present sales taxes in "other current liabilities" and ppl presents value-added taxes in "taxes" on the balance sheets. these taxes are not reflected on the statements of income. see note 5 for details on taxes included in "taxes, other than income" on the statements of income. leases (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the registrants evaluate whether arrangements entered into contain leases for accounting purposes. see note 11 for a discussion of arrangements under which ppl energy supply, lg&amp;e and ku are lessees for accounting purposes. fuel, materials and supplies (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) fuel, natural gas stored underground and materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method. fuel costs for electric generation are charged to expense as used. for lg&amp;e, natural gas supply costs are charged to expense as delivered to the distribution system. see note 6 for further discussion of the fuel adjustment clause and gas supply clause. (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) "fuel, materials and supplies" on the balance sheets consisted of the following at december 31. ppl ppl energy supply lke lg&amp;e ku 2012 2011 2012 2011

supply's natural gas stored underground is available for resale. guarantees (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) generally, the initial measurement of a guarantee liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception. however, there are certain guarantees excluded from the scope of accounting guidance and other guarantees that are not subject to the initial recognition and measurement provisions of accounting guidance that only require disclosure. see note 15 for further discussion of recorded and unrecorded guarantees. treasury stock (ppl and ppl electric) ppl and ppl electric restore all shares of common stock acquired to authorized but unissued shares of common stock upon acquisition. foreign currency translation and transactions (ppl) wpd's functional currency is the gbp, which is the local currency in the u.k. as such, assets and liabilities are translated to u.s. dollars at the exchange rates on the date of consolidation and related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period included in ppl's results of operations. adjustments resulting from foreign currency translation are recorded in oci. 260 gains or losses relating to foreign currency transactions are recognized in "other income (expense) - net" on the statements of income. see note 17 for additional information. new accounting guidance adopted (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) fair value measurements effective january 1, 2012, the registrants prospectively adopted accounting guidance that was issued to clarify existing fair value measurement guidance and to enhance fair value disclosures. the additional disclosures required by this guidance include quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used for level 3 measurements, qualitative information about the sensitivity of recurring level 3 measurements, information about any transfers between levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, information about when the current use of a non-financial asset is different from the highest and best use, and the fair value hierarchy classification for assets and liabilities whose fair value is disclosed only in the notes to the financial statements. the adoption of this standard resulted in additional disclosures but did not have a significant impact on the registrants. see note 18 for additional disclosures required by this guidance. testing goodwill for impairment effective january 1, 2012, the registrants prospectively adopted accounting guidance which allows an entity to elect the option to first make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill. if, based on this assessment, the entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not necessary. however, the first step of the impairment test is required if an entity concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment. the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the registrants. 2. segment and related information (ppl) since the acquisition of lke on november 1, 2010, ppl is organized into four segments: kentucky regulated, u.k. regulated (name change in 2012 from international regulated to more specifically reflect the focus of the segment), pennsylvania regulated and supply. other than the name change for the u.k. regulated segment, there were no other changes to this segment. ppl's segments are split between its regulated and competitive businesses with its regulated businesses further segmented by geographic location. the kentucky regulated segment consists primarily of lke's regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution operations, primarily in kentucky. this segment also includes lke's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. in addition, the kentucky regulated segment is allocated certain financing costs. see note 10 for additional information regarding the acquisition. the u.k. regulated segment primarily consists of the regulated electric distribution operations in the u.k. this includes the operating results and assets of wpd midlands since the april 1, 2011 acquisition date, recorded on a one-month lag. the u.k. regulated segment is also allocated certain wpd midlands acquisition-related costs and financing costs. see note 10 for additional information regarding the acquisition. the pennsylvania regulated segment includes the regulated electric transmission and distribution operations of ppl electric. the supply segment primarily consists of the domestic energy marketing and trading activities, as well as the competitive generation operations of ppl energy supply. the results of operations of several facilities and businesses have been classified as discontinued operations on the statements of income. see note 9 for additional information on these discontinued operations. therefore, with the exception of "net income attributable to ppl shareowners" the operating results from these facilities and businesses have been excluded from the income statement data tables below. 261 "corporate and other" represents costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, which is presented to reconcile segment information to ppl's consolidated results. for 2012 and 2011, there were no significant costs in this category. for 2010, these costs represent lke acquisition-related costs including advisory, accounting and legal fees, certain internal costs and 2010 bridge facility costs. beginning in 2013, ppl anticipates more costs to be included in the corporate and other category primarily due to an anticipated increase in the use of financing issued by ppl capital funding not directly attributable to a particular segment. ppl's recent growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through ppl capital funding, that further enables ppl to support targeted credit profiles cost effectively across all of ppl's rated companies. as a result, ppl plans to further utilize ppl capital funding in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies, as appropriate. the financing costs associated primarily with ppl capital funding's future securities issuances are not expected to be directly assignable or allocable to any segment and generally will be reflected in corporate and other beginning in 2013. financial data for the segments are: income statement data 2012 2011 2010

(ppl electric) ppl electric is authorized to issue up to 629,936 shares of 4-1/2% preferred stock and 10 million shares of series preferred stock. in april 2010, ppl electric redeemed all of its outstanding preferred stock (247,524 shares of 4-1/2% preferred stock and 257,665 shares of four series of preferred stock), with a par value in the aggregate of $51 million, for $54 million including accumulated dividends. (lg&amp;e) lg&amp;e is authorized to issue up to 1,720,000 shares of preferred stock at a $25 par value and 6,750,000 shares of preferred stock without par value. lg&amp;e had no preferred stock issued or outstanding in 2012, 2011 or 2010. (ku) ku is authorized to issue up to 5,300,000 shares of preferred stock without par value. ku had no preferred stock issued or outstanding in 2012, 2011 or 2010. preference stock (ppl electric) ppl electric is authorized to issue up to 10 million shares of preference stock and had 2.5 million shares of 6.25% series preference stock (preference shares) issued and outstanding at december 31, 2011 and 2010. in june 2012, ppl electric redeemed all 2.5 million shares of its outstanding preference shares, par value of $100 per share. the price paid for the redemption was the par value, without premium ($250 million in the aggregate). the preference shares were held by a bank that acted as depositary for 10 million depositary shares, each of which represented a one-quarter interest in a preference share. holders of the depositary shares were entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the preference shares, including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights, exercised through the bank acting as a depositary. the preference shares ranked senior to ppl electric's common stock but had no voting rights, except as provided by law, and they had a liquidation preference of $100 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share). (ku) ku is authorized to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preference stock without par value. ku had no preference stock issued or outstanding in 2012, 2011 or 2010. 264 4. earnings per share (ppl) basic eps is computed by dividing income available to ppl common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed by dividing income available to ppl common shareowners by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding that are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive non-participating securities were converted to common shares as calculated using the treasury stock method. in 2012, 2011 and 2010, these securities included stock options and performance units granted under incentive compensation plans and the purchase contracts associated with the 2011 and 2010 equity units. for 2012, these securities also included the ppl common stock forward sale agreements. see note 7 for additional information on the forward sale agreements. the forward sale agreements were dilutive under the treasury stock method for 2012 because the average stock price of ppl's common shares exceeded the forward sale price indicated in the forward sale agreements. the purchase contracts are dilutive under the treasury stock method if the average vwap of ppl common stock for a certain period exceeds approximately $30.99 and $28.80 for the 2011 and 2010 purchase contracts. the 2010 purchase contracts were dilutive for 2012 and 2011. subject to antidilution adjustments at december 31, 2012, the maximum number of shares issuable to settle the purchase contracts was 93.8 million shares, including 86.6 million shares that could be issued under standard provisions of the purchase contracts and 7.2 million shares that could be issued under make-whole provisions in the event of early settlement upon a fundamental change. see note 7 for additional information on the 2011 and 2010 equity units. reconciliations of the amounts of income and shares of ppl common stock (in thousands) for the periods ended december 31 used in the eps calculation are: 2012 2011 2010 income (numerator) income from continuing operations after income taxes attributable to ppl shareowners $ 1,532 $ 1,493 $ 955 less amounts allocated to participating securities 8 6 4 less issuance costs on subsidiary's preferred securities redeemed 6 income from continuing operations after income taxes available to ppl common shareowners $ 1,518 $ 1,487 $ 951 income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) available to ppl common shareowners $ (6) $ 2 $ (17) net income attributable to ppl shareowners $ 1,526 $ 1,495 $ 938 less amounts allocated to participating securities 8 6 4 less issuance costs on subsidiary's preferred securities redeemed 6 net income available to ppl common shareowners $ 1,512 $ 1,489 $ 934 shares of common stock (denominator) weighted-average shares - basic eps 580,276 550,395 431,345 add incremental non-participating securities: stock options and performance units 563 400 224 2010 purchase contracts 195 157 forward sale agreements 592 weighted-average shares - diluted eps 581,626 550,952 431,569 basic eps available to ppl common shareowners: income from continuing operations after income taxes $ 2.62 $ 2.70 $ 2.21 income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) (0.01) 0.01 (0.04) net income $ 2.61 $ 2.71 $ 2.17 diluted eps available to ppl common shareowners: income from continuing operations after income taxes $ 2.61 $ 2.70 $ 2.20 income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) (0.01) (0.03) net income $ 2.60 $ 2.70 $ 2.17 265 during 2012, ppl issued 936,218 shares of common stock related to the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units and conversion of stock units granted to directors under its stock-based compensation plans. in addition, ppl issued 279,945 and 2,326,917 shares of common stock related to its esop and drip during 2012. see note 12 for a discussion of ppl's stock-based compensation plans. the following stock options to purchase ppl common stock and performance units were excluded from the computations of diluted eps for the years ended december 31 because the effect would have been antidilutive.

(b) primarily related to a $101 million valuation allowance that was recorded against certain deferred tax assets as a result of the 2011 acquisition of wpd midlands. see note 10 for additional information on the acquisition. (c) the reduction of the u.k. statutory income tax rate resulted in a $35 million reduction in deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowances. see "reconciliation of income tax expense" below for more information on the impact of the u.k. finance act of 2011. (d) resulting from the projected revenue increase in connection with the expiration of the pennsylvania generation rate caps in 2010, the valuation allowance related to state net operating loss carryforwards over the remaining carryforward period was reduced by $72 million. ppl global does not pay or record u.s. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of wpd, with the exception of certain financing entities, as management has determined that the earnings are indefinitely reinvested. historically, dividends paid by wpd have been distributions from current year's earnings. wpd's long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future require reinvestment of wpd's undistributed earnings, and wpd would have to issue debt or access credit facilities to fund any distributions in excess of current earnings. additionally, u.s. long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future do not require or contemplate distributions from wpd in excess of some portion of future wpd earnings. the cumulative undistributed earnings are included in "earnings reinvested" on the balance sheets. the amounts considered indefinitely reinvested at december 31, 2012 and 2011 were $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion. if the wpd undistributed earnings were remitted as dividends, ppl global could be subject to additional u.s. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that could be payable on these foreign earnings. details of the components of income tax expense, a reconciliation of federal income taxes derived from statutory tax rates applied to "income from continuing operations before income taxes" to income taxes for reporting purposes, and details of "taxes, other than income" were: 267 2012 2011 2010 income tax expense (benefit) current -

(federal) (a) 1997 and prior 1997 and prior 1997 and prior 10/31/2010 and prior 10/31/2010 and prior 10/31/2010 and prior pennsylvania (state) 2008 and prior 2008 and prior 2008 and prior kentucky (state) 2008 and prior 2010 and prior 2010 and prior 2010 and prior montana (state) 2008 and prior 2008 and prior u.k. (foreign) 2010 and prior (a) for lke, lg&amp;e and ku 2009, as well as the ten month period ending october 31, 2010, remain open under the standard three year statute of limitations; however, the irs has completed its audit of these periods under the compliance assurance process, effectively closing them to audit adjustments. no issues remain outstanding. other (ppl and ppl energy supply) ppl changed its method of accounting for repair expenditures for tax purposes effective for its 2008 tax year for pennsylvania operations. ppl made the same change for its montana operations for tax year 2009. in 2011, the irs issued guidance on repair expenditures related to network assets providing a safe harbor method of determining whether the repair expenditures can be currently deducted for tax purposes. the irs has not yet issued guidance to provide a safe harbor method related to generation property. the irs may assert and ultimately conclude that ppl's deduction for generation-related expenditures should be disallowed in whole or in part. ppl believes that it has established an adequate reserve for this contingency. tax legislation (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) on january 2, 2013, h.r. 8, the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, was signed into law. the most significant extension of tax relief under this act applicable to ppl is the extension of bonus depreciation. this provision extends the current 50% expensing provision for qualifying property purchased and placed in service before january 1, 2014 (before january 1, 2015 for certain longer-lived and transportation assets). ppl is still evaluating the changes. however, ppl does not expect that the changes related to this legislation will have a material impact on income tax expense. 279 6. utility rate regulation regulatory assets and liabilities (ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) as discussed in note 1 and summarized below, ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku reflect the effects of regulatory actions in the financial statements for their cost-based rate-regulated utility operations. regulatory assets and liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire amount related to that item will be recovered or refunded within a year of the balance sheet date. as such, the primary items classified as current are related to rate mechanisms that periodically adjust to account for over- or under-collections. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lg&amp;e is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc and ferc, and ku is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc, ferc, vscc and tra. lg&amp;e's and ku's kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including certain adjustments to exclude non-regulated investments and costs recovered separately through other rate mechanisms. as such, lg&amp;e and ku earn a return on the net cash invested in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities. as a result of purchase accounting requirements, certain fair value amounts related to contracts that had favorable or unfavorable terms relative to market were recorded on the balance sheets with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. lg&amp;e and ku recover in customer rates the cost of coal contracts, power purchases and emission allowances. as a result, management believes the regulatory assets and liabilities created to offset the fair value amounts at lke's acquisition date meet the recognition criteria established by existing accounting guidance and eliminate any rate making impact of the fair value adjustments. lg&amp;e's and ku's customer rates will continue to reflect the original contracted prices for these contracts. (ppl, lke and ku) ku's virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of virginia base rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. ku's rates to municipal customers for wholesale requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a rate formula that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). ppl electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a ferc tariff that allows for recovery of transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update. see "transmission formula rate" below for additional information on this tariff. all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from distribution and transmission return on investment calculations; therefore, generally no return is earned on ppl electric's regulatory assets. (ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the following tables provide information about the regulatory assets and liabilities of cost-based rate-regulated utility operations. 280 ppl ppl electric 2012 2011 2012 2011 current regulatory assets: gas supply clause $ 11 $ 6 fuel adjustment clause 6 3 other 2 total current regulatory assets $ 19 $ 9 noncurrent regulatory assets: defined benefit plans $ 730 $ 615 $ 362 $ 276 taxes recoverable through future rates 293 289 293 289 storm costs 168 154 59 31 unamortized loss on debt 96 110 65 77 interest rate swaps 67 69 accumulated cost of removal of utility plant 71 53 71 53 coal contracts (a) 4 11 aros 26 18 other 28 30 3 3 total noncurrent regulatory assets $ 1,483 $ 1,349 $ 853 $ 729 current regulatory liabilities: generation supply charge $ 27 $ 42 $ 27 $ 42 ecr 4 7 gas supply clause 4 6 transmission service charge 6 2 6 2 transmission formula rate 5 5 universal service rider 17 1 17 1 other 3 10 2 3 total current regulatory liabilities $ 61 $ 73 $ 52 $ 53 noncurrent regulatory liabilities: accumulated cost of removal of utility plant $ 679 $ 651 coal contracts (a) 141 180 power purchase agreement - ovec (a) 108 116 net deferred tax assets 34 39 act 129 compliance rider 8 7 $ 8 $ 7 defined benefit plans 17 9 interest rate swaps 14 other 9 8 total noncurrent regulatory liabilities $ 1,010 $ 1,010 $ 8 $ 7 lke lg&amp;e ku 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 current regulatory assets: gas supply clause $ 11 $ 6 $ 11 $ 6 fuel adjustment clause 6 3 6 3 other 2 2 total current regulatory assets $ 19 $ 9 $ 19 $ 9 noncurrent regulatory assets: defined benefit plans $ 368 $ 339 $ 232 $ 225 $ 136 $ 114 storm costs 109 123 59 66 50 57 unamortized loss on debt 31 33 20 21 11 12 interest rate swaps 67 69 67 69 coal contracts (a) 4 11 2 5 2 6 aros 26 18 15 11 11 7 other 25 27 5 6 20 21 total noncurrent regulatory assets $ 630 $ 620 $ 400 $ 403 $ 230 $ 217 current regulatory liabilities: ecr $ 4 $ 7 $ 4 $ 7 gas supply clause 4 6 $ 4 $ 6 other 1 7 4 1 3 total current regulatory liabilities $ 9 $ 20 $ 4 $ 10 $ 5 $ 10 281 lke lg&amp;e ku 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 noncurrent regulatory liabilities: accumulated cost of removal of utility plant $ 679 $ 651 $ 297 $ 286 $ 382 $ 365 coal contracts (a) 141 180 61 78 80 102 power purchase agreement - ovec (a) 108 116 75 80 33 36 net deferred tax assets 34 39 28 31 6 8 defined benefit plans 17 9 17 9 interest rate swaps 14 7 7 other 9 8 3 3 6 5 total noncurrent regulatory liabilities $ 1,002 $ 1,003 $ 471 $ 478 $ 531 $ 525 (a) these regulatory assets and liabilities were recorded as offsets to certain intangible assets and liabilities that were recorded at fair value upon the acquisition of lke. following is an overview of selected regulatory assets and liabilities detailed in the preceding tables. specific developments with respect to certain of these regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed in "regulatory matters." (ppl and ppl electric) generation supply charge the generation supply charge is a cost recovery mechanism that permits ppl electric to recover costs incurred to provide generation supply to plr customers who receive basic generation supply service. the recovery includes charges for generation supply (energy and capacity and ancillary services), as well as administration of the acquisition process. in addition, the generation supply charge contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior quarters is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent quarter. universal service rider (usr ) ppl electric's distribution rates permit recovery of applicable costs associated with the universal service programs provided to ppl electric's residential customers. universal service programs include low-income programs, such as ontrack and winter relief assistance program (wrap). ontrack is a special payment program for low-income households within the federal poverty level who have difficulty paying their electric bills. this program is funded by residential customers and administered by community-based organizations. customers who participate in ontrack receive assistance in the form of reduced payment arrangements, protection against termination of electric service and referrals to other community programs and services. the wrap program reduces electric bills and improves living comfort for low-income customers by providing services such as weatherization measures and energy education services. the usr is applied to distribution charges for each customer who receives distribution service under ppl electric's residential service rate schedules. the usr contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from the current year is refunded to or recovered from residential customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year. taxes recoverable through future rates taxes recoverable through future rates represent the portion of future income taxes that will be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory practices. accordingly, this regulatory asset is recognized when the offsetting deferred tax liability is recognized. for general-purpose financial reporting, this regulatory asset and the deferred tax liability are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately. this regulatory asset is expected to be recovered over the period that the underlying book-tax timing differences reverse and the actual cash taxes are incurred. act 129 compliance rider in compliance with pennsylvania's act 129 of 2008 and implementing regulations, ppl electric's energy efficiency and conservation plan was approved by a puc order in october 2009. the order allows ppl electric to recover the maximum $250 million cost of the program ratably over the life of the plan, from january 1, 2010 through may 31, 2013. the plan includes programs intended to reduce electricity consumption. the recoverable costs include direct and indirect charges, including design and development costs, general and administrative costs and applicable state evaluator costs. the rates are applied to customers who receive distribution service through the act 129 compliance rider. the actual program costs are reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered at the end of the program. see below under "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" for additional information on act 129. 282 transmission service charge (tsc) ppl electric is charged by pjm for transmission service-related costs applicable to its plr customers. ppl electric passes these costs on to customers, who receive basic generation supply service through the puc-approved tsc cost recovery mechanism. the tsc contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year. transmission formula rates ppl electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. the formula rate is based on prior year expenditures and forecasted current calendar year transmission plant additions. an adjustment to the prior year expenditures is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. (ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) defined benefit plans recoverable costs of defined benefit plans represent the portion of unrecognized transition obligation, prior service cost and net actuarial losses that will be recovered in defined benefit plans expense through future base rates based upon established regulatory practices and are amortized over the average service lives of plan participants. these regulatory assets and liabilities are adjusted at least annually or whenever the funded status of defined benefit plans is re-measured. of the regulatory asset and liability balances recorded, costs of $60 million for ppl, $22 million for ppl electric, $38 million for lke, $24 million for lg&amp;e and $14 million for ku are expected to be amortized into net periodic defined benefit costs in 2013. storm costs ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku have the ability to request from the puc, kpsc and vscc the authority to treat expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory asset and defer and amortize such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes. once such authority is granted, ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku can request recovery of those expenses in a base rate case. unamortized loss on debt unamortized loss on reacquired debt represents losses on long-term debt reacquired or redeemed that have been deferred and will be amortized and recovered over either the original life of the extinguished debt or the life of the replacement debt (in the case of refinancing). such costs are being amortized through 2029 for ppl electric. such costs are being amortized through 2035 for lg&amp;e and 2036 for ppl, lke and ku. accumulated cost of removal of utility plant lg&amp;e and ku accrue for costs of removal through depreciation expense with an offsetting credit to a regulatory liability. the regulatory liability is relieved as costs are incurred. see note 1 for additional information. ppl electric does not accrue for costs of removal. when costs of removal are incurred, ppl electric records the deferral of costs as a regulatory asset. such deferral is included in rates and amortized over the subsequent five-year period. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ecr kentucky law permits lg&amp;e and ku to recover the costs, including a return of operating expenses and a return of and on capital invested, of complying with the clean air act and those federal, state or local environmental requirements which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired electric generating facilities. the kpsc requires reviews of the past operations of the environmental surcharge for six-month and two-year billing periods to evaluate the related charges, credits and rates of return, as well as to provide for the roll-in of ecr amounts to base rates each two-year period. the ecr regulatory asset or liability represents the amount that has been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and is typically recovered within 12 months. lg&amp;e and ku are authorized to receive a 10.63% and 10.10% return on projects associated with the 2009 and 2011 compliance plans. as a result of the settlement agreement in the 2012 283 rate case, beginning in 2013, lg&amp;e and ku will receive a 10.25% return on all ecr projects included in the 2009 and 2011 compliance plans. coal contracts as a result of purchase accounting associated with ppl's acquisition of lke, lg&amp;e's and ku's coal contracts were recorded at fair value on the balance sheets with offsets to regulatory assets for those contracts with unfavorable terms relative to current market prices and offsets to regulatory liabilities for those contracts with favorable terms relative to current market prices. these regulatory assets and liabilities are being amortized over the same terms as the related contracts, which expire at various times through 2016. gas supply clause lg&amp;e's natural gas rates contain a gas supply clause, whereby the expected cost of natural gas supply and variances between actual and expected costs from prior periods are adjusted quarterly in lg&amp;e's rates, subject to approval by the kpsc. the gas supply clause includes a separate natural gas procurement incentive mechanism, a performance-based rate, which allows lg&amp;e's rates to be adjusted annually to share variances between actual costs and market indices between the shareholders and the customers during each performance-based rate year (12 months ending october 31). the regulatory assets or liabilities represent the total amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanisms and are recovered within 18 months. fuel adjustment clauses lg&amp;e's and ku's retail electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause, whereby variances in the cost of fuel for electric generation, including transportation costs, from the costs embedded in base rates are adjusted in lg&amp;e's and ku's rates. the kpsc requires public hearings at six-month intervals to examine past fuel adjustments and at two-year intervals to review past operations of the fuel clause and, to the extent appropriate, reestablish the fuel charge included in base rates. ku also employs a levelized fuel factor mechanism for virginia customers using an average fuel cost factor based primarily on projected fuel costs. the virginia levelized fuel factor allows fuel recovery based on projected fuel costs for the coming year plus an adjustment for any under- or over-recovery of fuel expenses from the prior year. the regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered within 12 months. interest rate swaps (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) because realized amounts associated with lg&amp;e's interest rate swaps, including a terminated swap contract, are recoverable through rates based on an order from the kpsc, lg&amp;e's unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability until they are realized as interest expense. interest expense from existing swaps is realized and recovered over the terms of the associated debt, which matures through 2033. amortization of the gain/loss related to the terminated swap contract is recovered through 2035, as approved by the kpsc. (lke and lg&amp;e) in the third quarter of 2010, lg&amp;e recorded a pre-tax gain to reverse previously recorded losses of $21 million and $9 million to reflect the reclassification of its ineffective swaps and terminated swap to regulatory assets based on an order from the kpsc in the 2010 rate case whereby the cost of lg&amp;e's terminated swap was allowed to be recovered in base rates. previously, gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated as effective cash flow hedges were recorded within oci and common equity. the gains and losses on the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were recorded to earnings monthly, as was the entire change in the market value of the ineffective swaps. 284 (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) in november 2012, lg&amp;e and ku entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with ppl that hedge the interest payments on new debt that is expected to be issued in 2013. these hedging instruments have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by ppl with third parties. lg&amp;e and ku believe that realized gains and losses from the swaps are probable of recovery through regulated rates; as such, the fair value of these derivatives have been reclassified from aoci to regulatory assets or liabilities. the gains and losses will be recognized in "interest expense" on the statements of income over the life of the underlying debt. see note 19 for additional information related to the forward-starting interest rate swaps. aros as discussed in note 1, the accretion and depreciation related to lg&amp;e's and ku's aros are offset with a regulatory credit on the income statement, such that there is no earnings impact. when an asset with an aro is retired, the related aro regulatory asset created by the regulatory credit is offset against the associated regulatory liability, pp&amp;e and aro liability. power purchase agreement - ovec as a result of purchase accounting associated with ppl's acquisition of lke, the fair values of the ovec power purchase agreement were recorded on the balance sheets of lke, lg&amp;e and ku with offsets to regulatory liabilities. the regulatory liabilities are being amortized using the units-of-production method until march 2026, the expiration date of the agreement at the date of the acquisition. regulatory liability associated with net deferred tax assets lg&amp;e's and ku's regulatory liabilities associated with net deferred tax assets represent the future revenue impact from the reversal of deferred income taxes required primarily for unamortized investment tax credits. these regulatory liabilities are recognized when the offsetting deferred tax assets are recognized. for general-purpose financial reporting, these regulatory liabilities and the deferred tax assets are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately. regulatory matters kentucky activities (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) rate case proceedings in june 2012, lg&amp;e and ku filed requests with the kpsc for increases in annual base electric rates of approximately $62 million at lg&amp;e and approximately $82 million at ku and an increase in annual base gas rates of approximately $17 million at lg&amp;e. in november 2012, lg&amp;e and ku along with all of the parties filed a unanimous settlement agreement. among other things, the settlement provided for increases in annual base electric rates of $34 million at lg&amp;e and $51 million at ku and an increase in annual base gas rates of $15 million at lg&amp;e. the settlement agreement also included revised depreciation rates that result in reduced annual electric depreciation expense of approximately $9 million for lg&amp;e and approximately $10 million for ku. the settlement agreement included an authorized return on equity at lg&amp;e and ku of 10.25%. on december 20, 2012, the kpsc issued orders approving the provisions in the settlement agreement. the new rates became effective on january 1, 2013. in addition to the increased base rates, the kpsc approved a gas line tracker mechanism for lg&amp;e to provide for recovery of costs associated with lg&amp;e's gas main replacement program, gas service lines and risers. independent transmission operators in september 2012, lg&amp;e and ku completed the transition of their independent transmission operator contractual arrangements from southwest power pool, inc. to transerv international, inc. this change had previously received approvals of the ferc and the kpsc. 285 (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) cpcn filing in october 2012, lg&amp;e filed an application with the kpsc to construct a new wet scrubber to serve unit 3 at the mill creek generating station. the application partially modifies the existing authority granted by the kpsc in 2011, which authorized lg&amp;e to build two new scrubbers to serve mill creek units 1 and 2 and another to serve mill creek unit 4. additionally, authority was granted allowing the mill creek unit 3 to be served by the existing unit 4 scrubber. the cpcn sought approval to construct a new wet scrubber on mill creek unit 3 instead of utilizing the unit 4 scrubber. in february 2013, lg&amp;e received the requested kpsc approval to construct a new wet scrubber to serve unit 3 at the mill creek generating station. storm costs in august 2011, a strong storm hit lg&amp;e's service area causing significant damage and widespread outages for approximately 139,000 customers. lg&amp;e filed an application with the kpsc in september 2011, requesting approval of a regulatory asset recorded to defer, for future recovery, $8 million in incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to the storm restoration. an order was received in december 2011 granting the request. on december 20, 2012, the kpsc in the approval of the unanimous rate case settlement agreement, authorized regulatory asset recovery effective january 1, 2013, over a five year period. pennsylvania activities (ppl and ppl electric) rate case proceeding in march 2012, ppl electric filed a request with the puc to increase distribution rates by approximately $105 million, effective january 1, 2013. in its december 28, 2012 final order, the puc approved a 10.4% return on equity and a total distribution revenue increase of about $71 million. the approved rates became effective january 1, 2013. also, in its december 28, 2012 final order, the puc directed ppl electric to file a proposed storm damage expense rider within 90 days following the order. ppl electric plans to file a proposed storm damage expense rider with the puc and, as part of that filing, request recovery of the $28 million of qualifying storm costs incurred as a result of the october 2012 landfall of hurricane sandy. see "storm costs" below for additional information regarding hurricane sandy. act 129 act 129 requires pennsylvania electric distribution companies (edcs) to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified dates. edcs not meeting the requirements of act 129 are exposed to significant penalties. under act 129, edcs must file an energy efficiency and conservation plan (ee&amp;c plan) with the puc and contract with conservation service providers to implement all or a portion of the ee&amp;c plan. act 129 requires edcs to reduce overall electricity consumption by 1.0% by may 2011 and, by may 2013, reduce overall electricity consumption by 3.0% and reduce peak demand by 4.5%. the peak demand reduction must occur for the 100 hours of highest demand, which is determined by actual demand reduction during the june 2012 through september 2012 period. edcs will be able to recover the costs (capped at 2.0% of the edc's 2006 revenue) of implementing their ee&amp;c plans. in october 2009, the puc approved ppl electric's ee&amp;c plan, and in march 2012 confirmed that ppl electric met the 2011 requirement. ppl electric will determine if it met the peak demand reduction target and the may 2013 energy reduction target after it completes the final program evaluation on november 5, 2013. act 129 requires the puc to evaluate the costs and benefits of the ee&amp;c program by november 30, 2013 and adopt additional reductions if the benefits of the program exceed the costs. in august 2012, after receiving input from stakeholders, the puc issued a final implementation order establishing a three-year phase ii program, ending may 31, 2016, with individual consumption reduction targets for each edc. ppl electric's reduction target is 2.1%. the puc did not establish demand reduction targets for the phase ii program. ppl electric filed its phase ii ee&amp;c plan with the puc on november 15, 2012 and the puc is expected to issue its decision in march 2013. act 129 also requires the default service provider (dsp) to provide electric generation supply service to customers pursuant to a puc-approved default service procurement plan through auctions, requests for proposal and bilateral contracts at the sole discretion of the dsp. act 129 requires a mix of spot market purchases, short-term contracts and long-term contracts (4 to 20 286 years), with long-term contracts limited to 25% of load unless otherwise approved by the puc. the dsp will be able to recover the costs associated with a competitive procurement plan. the puc has approved ppl electric's procurement plan for the period january 1, 2011 through may 31, 2013, and ppl electric concluded all competitive solicitations to procure power for its plr obligations under that plan. the puc has directed all edcs to file default service procurement plans for the period june 1, 2013 through may 31, 2015. ppl electric filed its plan in may 2012. in that plan, ppl electric proposed a process to obtain supply for its default service customers and a number of initiatives designed to encourage more customers to purchase electricity from the competitive retail market. in its january 24, 2013 final order, the puc approved ppl electric's plan with modifications and directed ppl electric to establish collaborative processes to address several retail competition issues. smart meter rider act 129 also requires installation of smart meters for new construction, upon the request of consumers and at their cost, or on a depreciation schedule not exceeding 15 years. under act 129, edcs will be able to recover the costs of providing smart metering technology. in august 2009, ppl electric filed its proposed smart meter technology procurement and installation plan with the puc. all of ppl electric's metered customers currently have smart meters installed at their service locations. ppl electric's current advanced metering technology generally satisfies the requirements of act 129 and does not need to be replaced. in june 2010, the puc entered its order approving ppl electric's smart meter plan with several modifications. in compliance with the order, in the third quarter of 2010, ppl electric submitted a revised plan with a cost estimate of $38 million to be incurred over a five-year period, beginning in 2009, and filed its section 1307(e) cost recovery mechanism, the smart meter rider (smr) to recover these costs beginning january 1, 2011. in december 2010, the puc approved ppl electric's smr which reflects the costs of its smart meter program plus a return on its smart meter investments. the smr, which became effective january 1, 2011, contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to or collected from customers in the subsequent year. in august 2011, ppl electric filed with the puc an annual report describing the actions it was taking under its smart meter plan in 2011 and its planned actions for 2012. ppl electric also submitted revised smr charges which became effective january 1, 2012. in august 2012, ppl electric filed with the puc an annual report describing the actions it was taking under its smart meter plan in 2012 and its planned actions for 2013. ppl electric also submitted revised smr charges which became effective january 1, 2013. puc investigation of retail electricity market in april 2011, the puc opened an investigation of pennsylvania's retail electricity market to be conducted in two phases. phase one addressed the status of the existing retail market and explored potential changes. questions issued by the puc for this phase of the investigation focused primarily on default service issues. phase two was initiated in july 2011 to develop specific proposals for changes to the retail market and default service model. in december 2011, the puc issued a final order providing guidance to edcs on the design of their next default service procurement plan filings. in december 2011, the puc also issued a tentative order proposing an intermediate work plan to address issues raised in the investigation. in march 2012, the puc entered a final order on the intermediate work plan, issued three possible models for the default service "end state" and held a hearing regarding those three models. in september 2012, the puc issued a secretarial letter setting forth an "rmi end state proposal" for discussion. the puc issued a tentative implementation order in early november 2012, following which parties had 30 days to provide comment. ppl electric and ppl energyplus filed joint comments. a final implementation order was issued on february 15, 2013. although the final implementation order contains provisions that will require numerous modifications to ppl electric's current default service model for retail customers, those modifications are not expected to have a material adverse effect on ppl electric's results of operations. legislation - regulatory procedures and mechanisms act 11 authorizes the puc to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms - the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a dsic. such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to ppl electric as it begins a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging distribution assets. in august 2012, the puc issued a final implementation order adopting procedures, guidelines and a model tariff for the implementation of act 11. act 11 requires utilities to file an ltiip as a prerequisite to filing for recovery through the dsic. the ltiip is mandated to be a five- to ten-year plan describing projects eligible for inclusion in the dsic. in september 2012, ppl electric filed its ltiip describing projects eligible for inclusion in the dsic. the puc approved the ltiip on january 10, 2013 and ppl electric filed a petition requesting permission to establish a dsic on january 15, 2013, with rates proposed to be effective beginning may 1, 2013. 287 storm costs during 2012, ppl electric experienced several puc-reportable storms, including hurricane sandy, resulting in total restoration costs of $81 million, of which $61 million were initially recorded in "other operation and maintenance" on the statement of income. in particular, in late october 2012, ppl electric experienced widespread significant damage to its distribution network from hurricane sandy resulting in total restoration costs of $66 million, of which $50 million were initially recorded in "other operation and maintenance" on the statement of income. although ppl electric had storm insurance coverage, the costs incurred from hurricane sandy exceeded the policy limits. probable insurance recoveries recorded during 2012 were $18.25 million, of which $14 million were included in "other operation and maintenance" on the statement of income. ppl electric recorded a regulatory asset of $28 million in december 2012 (offset to "other operation and maintenance" on the statement of income). in february 2013, ppl electric received an order from the puc granting permission to defer qualifying storm costs in excess of insurance recoveries associated with hurricane sandy. see "rate case proceeding" above for information regarding ppl electric's plan to file a proposed storm damage expense rider with the puc. ppl electric experienced several puc-reportable storms during 2011 including hurricane irene and a late october snow storm. total restoration costs were $84 million, of which $54 million were initially recorded in "other operation and maintenance" on the statement of income. although ppl electric had storm insurance coverage with a ppl affiliate, the costs associated with the unusually high number of puc-reportable storms exceeded policy limits. probable insurance recoveries recorded during 2011 were $26.5 million, of which $16 million were included in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income. in december 2011, ppl electric received orders from the puc granting permission to defer qualifying storm costs in excess of insurance recoveries associated with hurricane irene and a late october 2011 snowstorm. ppl electric recorded a regulatory asset of $25 million in december 2011 (offset to "other operation and maintenance" on the statement of income). the puc granted ppl electric's recovery of the 2011 storm costs in its final order in the 2012 rate case. recovery began in january 2013 and will continue over a five year period. federal matters ferc formula rates (ppl and ppl electric ) transmission rates are regulated by the ferc. ppl electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. ppl electric has initiated its formula rate 2012, 2011 and 2010 annual updates. each update has been subsequently challenged by a group of municipal customers, which challenges have been opposed by ppl electric. in august 2011, the ferc issued an order substantially rejecting the 2010 formal challenge and the municipal customers filed a request for rehearing of that order. in september 2012, the ferc issued an order setting for evidentiary hearings and settlement judge procedures a number of issues raised in the 2010 and 2011 formal challenges. settlement conferences were held in late 2012 and early 2013. in february 2013, the ferc set for evidentiary hearings and settlement judge procedures a number of issues in the 2012 formal challenge and consolidated that challenge with the 2010 and 2011 challenges. ppl electric anticipates that there will be additional settlement conferences held in 2013. ppl and ppl electric cannot predict the outcome of the foregoing proceedings, which remain pending before the ferc. in march 2012, ppl electric filed a request with the ferc seeking recovery of its regulatory asset related to the deferred state tax liability that existed at the time of the transition from the flow-through treatment of state income taxes to full normalization. this change in tax treatment occurred in 2008 as a result of prior ferc initiatives that transferred regulatory jurisdiction of certain transmission assets from the puc to ferc. at december 31, 2012 and 2011, $52 million and $53 million respectively, are classified as taxes recoverable through future rates and included on the balance sheets in "other noncurrent assets - regulatory assets." in may 2012, the ferc issued an order approving ppl electric's request to recover the deferred tax regulatory asset over a 34-year period beginning june 1, 2012. u.k. activities (ppl) ofgem review of line loss calculation wpd had a $94 million liability recorded at december 31, 2012, compared with $170 million at december 31, 2011, related to the close-out of line losses for the prior price control period, dpcr4. ofgem is currently consulting on the methodology to be used by all network operators to calculate the final line loss incentive/penalty for the dpcr4. in october 2011, ofgem issued a consultation paper citing two potential changes to the methodology, both of which would result in a reduction of the liability. in march 2012, ofgem issued a decision regarding the preferred methodology. in july 2012, ofgem issued a 288 consultation paper regarding certain aspects of the preferred methodology as it relates to the dpcr4 line loss incentive/penalty and a proposal to delay the target date for making a final decision until april 2013. in october 2012, a license modification was issued to allow ofgem to publish the final decisions on these matters by april 2013. in november 2012, ofgem issued an additional consultation on the final dpcr4 line loss close-out that published values for each dno and further indicated the preferred methodology that would replace the methodology under wpd's licenses. based on applying the preferred methodology for dpcr4, the liability was reduced by $79 million, with a credit recorded in "utility" on the statement of income, to reflect what wpd expects to be the final close-out settlement under ofgem's preferred methodology. this consultation also confirmed the final decisions will be published by april 2013. in february 2013, ofgem issued additional consultation proposing to delay the april 2013 decision date. ppl cannot predict when this matter will be resolved. ofgem also stated in the november 2012 consultation that the line loss incentive implemented at the last rate review will be withdrawn and no incentive will apply for the dpcr5 period. that decision resulted in the elimination of the dpcr5 liability of $11 million, with a credit recorded in "utility" on the statement of income. european market infrastructure regulation regulation no. 648/2012 of the european parliament and of the council, commonly referred to as the european market infrastructure regulation (emir), entered into force on august 16, 2012 and the european commission adopted most of the regulatory technical standards without modification in december 2012. the emir establishes certain transaction clearing and other recordkeeping requirements for parties to over-the-counter derivatives transactions. included in the derivative transactions that are subject to emir are certain interest rate and currency derivative contracts utilized by wpd. generally, wpd is expected to qualify under the emir as a non-financial counterparty to the transactions in which it engages and further to qualify for certain exemptions that will relieve wpd from the mandatory clearing obligations imposed by the emir. although the emir will potentially impose significant additional recordkeeping requirements on wpd, the effect of the emir is not currently expected to have a significant adverse impact on wpd's financial condition or results of operation. 7. financing activities credit arrangements and short-term debt (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support, and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs. for reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, the credit facilities of ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku also apply to ppl and the credit facilities of lg&amp;e and ku also apply to lke. the following credit facilities were in place at: december 31, 2012

amounts borrowed are recorded as "short-term debt" on the balance sheets. (b) in december 2012, the ppl ww credit facility was subsequently replaced with a credit facility expiring in december 2016 and the capacity was increased to 210 million. (c) the facilities contain financial covenants that require the company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and total net debt not in excess of 85% of its rav, calculated in accordance with the credit facility. (d) under these facilities, wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands) each have the ability to request the lenders to issue up to 80 million of letters of credit in lieu of borrowing. (e) the total amounts borrowed at december 31, 2012 and 2011 were usd-denominated borrowings of $171 million and $178 million, which equated to 106 million and 111 million at the time of the borrowings. the interest rates at december 31, 2012 and 2011 were 0.8452% and 1.05%. at december 31, 2012, the unused capacity of wpd's credit facilities was approximately $1.6 billion. (f) each company pays customary fees under its respective facility and borrowings generally bear interest at libor-based rates plus an applicable margin. (g) in october 2010, ppl energy supply borrowed $3.2 billion under this facility in order to enable a subsidiary to make loans to certain affiliates to provide interim financing of amounts required by ppl to partially fund ppl's acquisition of lke. such borrowing bore interest at 2.26% and was refinanced primarily through the issuance of long-term debt by lke, lg&amp;e and ku and the use of internal funds. this borrowing and related payments were included in "net increase (decrease) in short-term debt" on the statement of cash flows. ppl energy supply incurred an aggregate of $41 million of fees in 2010 in connection with establishing this facility. such fees were initially deferred and amortized through december 2014. in connection with the reduction in the capacity from $4 billion to $3 billion in december 2010, ppl energy supply wrote off $10 million, $6 million after tax, of deferred fees, which was reflected in "interest expense" in the statement of income. (h) the facilities contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 65% for ppl energy supply and 70% for ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku, as calculated in accordance with the facilities and other customary covenants. additionally, as it relates to the syndicated credit facilities and subject to certain conditions, ppl energy supply may request that its facility's capacity be increased by up to $500 million and ppl electric and ku each may request up to a $100 million increase in its facility's' capacity. (i) ppl electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through which ppl electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts receivable and unbilled revenue to a special purpose, wholly owned subsidiary on an ongoing basis. the subsidiary has pledged these assets to secure loans from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by a financial institution. at december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011, $238 million and $251 million of accounts receivable and $106 million and $98 million of unbilled revenue were pledged by the subsidiary under the credit agreement related to ppl electric's and the subsidiary's participation in the asset-backed commercial paper program. based on the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue pledged at december 31, 2012, the amount available for borrowing under the facility was $100 million. ppl electric's sale to its subsidiary of the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue is an absolute sale of assets, and ppl electric does not retain an interest in these assets. however, for financial reporting purposes, the subsidiary's financial results are consolidated in ppl electric's financial statements. ppl electric performs certain record-keeping and cash collection functions with respect to the assets in return for a servicing fee from the subsidiary.

(c) includes ppl electric's senior secured and first mortgage bonds that are secured by the lien of ppl electric's 2001 mortgage indenture, which covers substantially all electric distribution plant and certain transmission plant owned by ppl electric. the carrying value of ppl electric's property, plant and equipment was approximately $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion at december 31, 2012 and 2011. lg&amp;e's first mortgage bonds are secured by the lien of the lg&amp;e 2010 mortgage indenture, which creates a lien, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions, on substantially all of lg&amp;e's real and tangible personal property located in kentucky and used or to be used in connection with the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and the storage and distribution of natural gas. the aggregate carrying value of the property subject to the lien was $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011. ku's first mortgage bonds are secured by the lien of the ku 2010 mortgage indenture, which creates a lien, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions, on substantially all of ku's real and tangible personal property located in kentucky and used or to be used in connection with the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. the aggregate carrying value of the property subject to the lien was $4.4 billion and $4.1 billion at december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011. (d) includes ppl electric's series of senior secured bonds that secure its obligations to make payments with respect to each series of pollution control bonds that were issued by the lcida and the pedfa on behalf of ppl electric. these senior secured bonds were issued in the same principal amount, contain payment and redemption provisions that correspond to and bear the same interest rate as such pollution control bonds. these senior secured bonds were issued under ppl electric's 2001 mortgage indenture and are secured as noted in (c) above. this amount includes $224 million that may be redeemed at par beginning in 2015 and $90 million that may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at par beginning in october 2020 and are subject to mandatory redemption upon determination that the interest rate on the bonds would be included in the holders' gross income for federal tax purposes. (e) includes lg&amp;e's and ku's series of first mortgage bonds that were issued to the respective trustees of tax-exempt revenue bonds to secure its respective obligations to make payments with respect to each series of bonds. the first mortgage bonds were issued in the same principal amount, contain payment and redemption provisions that correspond to and bear the same interest rate as such tax-exempt revenue bonds. these first mortgage bonds were issued under the lg&amp;e 2010 mortgage indenture and the ku 2010 mortgage indenture and are secured as noted in (c) above. the related tax-exempt revenue bonds were issued by various governmental entities, principally counties in kentucky, on behalf of lg&amp;e and ku. the related revenue bond documents allow lg&amp;e and ku to convert the interest rate mode on the bonds from time to time to a commercial paper rate, daily rate, weekly rate, term rate of at least one year or, in some cases, an auction rate or a libor index rate. at december 31, 2012, the aggregate tax-exempt revenue bonds issued on behalf of lg&amp;e and ku that were in a term rate mode totaled $321 million for lke, comprised of $294 million and $27 million for lg&amp;e and ku. at december 31, 2012, the aggregate tax-exempt revenue bonds issued on behalf of lg&amp;e and ku that were in a variable rate mode totaled $604 million for lke, comprised of $280 million and $324 million for lg&amp;e and ku. several series of the tax-exempt revenue bonds are insured by monoline bond insurers whose ratings were reduced due to exposures relating to insurance of sub-prime mortgages. of the bonds outstanding, $231 million are in the form of insured auction rate securities, wherein interest rates are reset either weekly or every 35 days via an auction process. beginning in late 2007, the interest rates on these insured bonds began to increase due to investor concerns about the creditworthiness of the bond insurers. during 2008, interest rates increased, and lg&amp;e and ku experienced failed auctions when there were insufficient bids for the bonds. when a failed auction occurs, the interest rate is set pursuant to a formula stipulated in the indenture. as noted above, the instruments governing these auction rate bonds permit lg&amp;e and ku to convert the bonds to other interest rate modes. certain variable rate tax-exempt revenue bonds totaling $348 million at december 31, 2012, are subject to tender for purchase by lg&amp;e and ku at the option of the holder and to mandatory tender for purchase by lg&amp;e and ku upon the occurrence of certain events. (f) includes 225 million ($361 million at december 31, 2012) of notes that may be redeemed, in total but not in part, on december 21, 2026, at the greater of the principal value or a value determined by reference to the gross redemption yield on a nominated u.k. government bond. (g) the principal amount of the notes issued by wpd (south west) and wpd (east midlands) are adjusted based on changes in a specified index, as detailed in the terms of the related indentures. the adjustment to the principal amounts from 2011 to 2012 was an increase of approximately 9 million ($14 million) resulting from inflation. in addition, this amount includes 225 million ($361 million at december 31, 2012) of notes issued by wpd (south west) that may be redeemed, in total by series, on december 1, 2026, at the greater of the adjusted principal value and a make-whole value determined by reference to the gross real yield on a nominated u.k. government bond. (h) includes 3.3 billion ($5.3 billion at december 31, 2012) of notes that may be put by the holders back to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies (moody's, s&amp;p or fitch) or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of ba1 or bb+ in connection with a restructuring event which includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which the issuer operates. none of the outstanding debt securities noted above have sinking fund requirements. the aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the periods 2013 through 2017 and thereafter are as follows. 293 ppl energy ppl ppl supply electric lke lg&amp;e ku 2013 $ 751 $ 751 2014 328 318 $ 10 2015 1,317 317 100 $ 900 $ 250 $ 250 2016 828 368 2017 118 18 thereafter 16,093 1,477 1,864 3,185 859 1,601 total $ 19,435 $ 3,249 $ 1,974 $ 4,085 $ 1,109 $ 1,851 long-term debt and equity securities activities (ppl) in april 2012, ppl made a registered underwritten public offering of 9.9 million shares of its common stock. in conjunction with that offering, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase 591 thousand additional shares of ppl common stock solely to cover over-allotments. in connection with the registered public offering, ppl entered into forward sale agreements with two counterparties covering the 9.9 million shares of ppl common stock. settlement of these initial forward sale agreements will occur no later than april 2013. as a result of the underwriters' exercise of the overallotment option, ppl entered into additional forward sale agreements covering the 591 thousand additional shares of ppl common stock. settlement of the subsequent forward sale agreements will occur no later than july 2013. upon any physical settlement of any forward sale agreement, ppl will issue and deliver to the forward counterparties shares of its common stock in exchange for cash proceeds per share equal to the forward sale price. the forward sale price will be calculated based on an initial forward price of $27.02 per share reduced during the period the contracts are outstanding as specified in the forward sale agreements. ppl may, in certain circumstances, elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of its rights or obligations under the forward sale agreements. ppl will not receive any proceeds or issue any shares of common stock until settlement of the forward sale agreements. ppl intends to use any net proceeds that it receives upon settlement to repay short-term debt obligations and for other general corporate purposes. the forward sale agreements are classified as equity transactions. as a result, no amounts will be recorded in the consolidated financial statements until the settlement of the forward sale agreements. prior to those settlements, the only impact to the financial statements will be the inclusion of incremental shares within the calculation of diluted eps using the treasury stock method. see note 4 for information on the forward sale agreements impact on the calculation of diluted eps. in april 2012, wpd (east midlands) issued 100 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2023. wpd (east midlands) received proceeds of 111 million, which equated to $178 million at the time of issuance, net of underwriting fees. the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. in june 2012, ppl capital funding issued $400 million of 4.20% senior notes due 2022. the notes may be redeemed at ppl capital funding's option any time prior to maturity at make-whole redemption prices. ppl capital funding received proceeds of $396 million, net of a discount and underwriting fees, which were used for general corporate purposes. in august 2012, ppl capital funding redeemed at par, plus accrued interest, the $99 million outstanding principal amount of its 6.85% senior notes due 2047. in october 2012, ppl capital funding issued $400 million of 3.50% senior notes due 2022. the notes may be redeemed at ppl capital funding's option any time prior to maturity at make-whole redemption prices. ppl capital funding received proceeds of $397 million, net of a discount and underwriting fees, which were used to repay short-term debt obligations, including commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes.

(ppl and ppl electric) see note 3 for information regarding ppl electric's june 2012 redemption of all 2.5 million shares of its 6.25% series preference stock, par value $100 per share. in august 2012, ppl electric issued $250 million of 2.50% first mortgage bonds due 2022. the notes may be redeemed at ppl electric's option any time prior to maturity at make-whole redemption prices. ppl electric received proceeds of $247 million, net of a discount and underwriting fees. the net proceeds were used to repay short-term debt incurred to fund ppl electric's redemption of its 6.25% series preference stock in june 2012 and for other general corporate purposes. (ppl and lke) in june 2012, lke completed an exchange of $250 million of 4.375% senior notes due 2021 issued in september 2011 in a transaction not registered under the securities act of 1933, for similar securities that were issued in a transaction registered with the sec. (ppl) 2011 equity units in april 2011, in connection with the acquisition of wpd midlands, ppl issued 92 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $25.30 per share, for a total of $2.328 billion. proceeds from the issuance were $2.258 billion, net of the $70 million underwriting discount. ppl also issued 19.55 million 2011 equity units at a stated amount per unit of $50.00 for a total of $978 million. proceeds from the issuance were $948 million, net of the $30 million underwriting discount. ppl used the net proceeds to repay ppl capital funding's borrowings under the 2011 bridge facility, as discussed above, to pay certain acquisition-related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. each 2011 equity unit consists of a 2011 purchase contract and, initially, a 5.0% undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of ppl capital funding 4.32% junior subordinated notes due 2019 (2019 notes). each 2011 purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and ppl to sell, for $50.00 a number of shares of ppl common stock to be determined by the average vwap of ppl's common stock for the 20-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to may 1, 2014, subject to antidilution adjustments and an early settlement upon a fundamental change as follows: if the average vwap equals or exceeds approximately $30.99, then 1.6133 shares (a minimum of 31,540,015 shares); if the average vwap is less than approximately $30.99 but greater than $25.30, a number of shares of common stock having a value, based on the average vwap, equal to $50.00; and if the average vwap is less than or equal to $25.30, then 1.9763 shares (a maximum of 38,636,665 shares). if holders elect to settle the 2011 purchase contract prior to may 1, 2014, they will receive 1.6133 shares of ppl common stock, subject to antidilution adjustments and an early settlement upon a fundamental change. a holder's ownership interest in the 2019 notes is pledged to ppl to secure the holder's obligation under the related 2011 purchase contract. if a holder of a 2011 purchase contract chooses at any time no longer to be a holder of the 2019 notes, such holder's obligation under the 2011 purchase contract must be secured by a u.s. treasury security. each 2011 purchase contract also requires ppl to make quarterly contract adjustment payments at a rate of 4.43% per year on the $50.00 stated amount of the 2011 equity unit. ppl has the option to defer these contract adjustment payments until the 2011 purchase contract settlement date. deferred contract adjustment payments will accrue additional contract adjustment payments at the rate of 8.75% per year until paid. until any deferred contract adjustment payments have been paid, ppl may not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase or acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock, subject to certain exceptions. 295 the 2019 notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ppl as to payment of principal and interest. the 2019 notes initially bear interest at 4.32% and are not subject to redemption prior to may 2016. beginning may 2016, ppl capital funding may, at its option, redeem the 2019 notes, in whole but not in part, at any time, at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. the 2019 notes are expected to be remarketed in 2014 into two tranches, such that neither tranche will have an aggregate principal amount of less than the lesser of $250 million and 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 notes to be remarketed. one tranche will mature on or about the third anniversary of the settlement of the remarketing, and the other tranche will mature on or about the fifth anniversary of such settlement. upon a successful remarketing, the interest rate on the 2019 notes may be reset and the maturity of the tranches may be modified as necessary. in connection with a remarketing, ppl capital funding may elect with respect to each tranche, to extend or eliminate the early redemption date and/or calculate interest on the notes of a tranche on a fixed or floating rate basis. if the remarketing fails, holders of the 2019 notes will have the right to put their notes to ppl capital funding on may 1, 2014 for an amount equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest. prior to may 2016, ppl capital funding may elect at one or more times to defer interest payments on the 2019 notes for one or more consecutive interest periods until the earlier of the third anniversary of the interest payment due date and may 2016. deferred interest payments will accrue additional interest at a rate equal to the interest rate then applicable to the 2019 notes. until any deferred interest payments have been paid, ppl may not, subject to certain exceptions, (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase or acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock, (ii) make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, purchase or redeem any of its debt securities that upon its liquidation ranks equal with, or junior in interest to, the subordinated guarantee of the 2019 notes by ppl as of the date of issuance and (iii) make any payments regarding any guarantee by ppl of securities of any of its subsidiaries (other than ppl capital funding) if the guarantee ranks equal with, or junior in interest to, the 2019 notes as of the date of their issuance. in the financial statements, the proceeds from the sale of the 2011 equity units were allocated to the 2019 notes and the 2011 purchase contracts, including the obligation to make contract adjustment payments, based on the underlying fair value of each instrument at the time of issuance. as a result, the 2019 notes were recorded at $978 million, which approximated fair value, as long-term debt. at the time of issuance, the present value of the contract adjustment payments of $123 million was recorded to other liabilities representing the obligation to make contract adjustment payments, with an offsetting reduction to additional paid-in capital for the issuance of the 2011 purchase contracts, which approximated the fair value of each. the liability is being accreted through interest expense over the three-year term of the 2011 purchase contracts. the initial valuation of the contract adjustment payments is considered a non-cash transaction that is excluded from the statement of cash flows in 2011. costs to issue the 2011 equity units were primarily allocated on a relative cost basis, resulting in $25 million being recorded to "additional paid-in capital" and $6 million being recorded to "other noncurrent assets" on the balance sheet. see note 4 for eps considerations related to the 2011 purchase contracts. 2010 equity units in june 2010, in connection with the acquisition of lke, ppl issued 103.5 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $24.00 per share, for a total of $2.484 billion. proceeds from the issuance were $2.409 billion, net of the $75 million underwriting discount. ppl also issued 23 million 2010 equity units at a stated amount per unit of $50.00 for a total of $1.150 billion. proceeds from the issuance were $1.116 billion, net of the $34 million underwriting discount. each 2010 equity unit consists of a purchase contract and, initially, a 5.0% undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of ppl capital funding 4.625% junior subordinated notes due 2018 (2018 notes). each 2010 purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and ppl to sell, for $50.00 a variable number of shares of ppl common stock determined by the average vwap of ppl's common stock for the 20-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to july 1, 2013, subject to antidilution adjustments and an early settlement upon a fundamental change as follows: if the average vwap equals or exceeds $28.80, then 1.7361 shares (a minimum of 39,930,300 shares); if the average vwap is less than $28.80 but greater than $24.00, a number of shares of common stock having a value, based on the average vwap, equal to $50.00; and if the average vwap is less than or equal to $24.00, then 2.0833 shares (a maximum of 47,915,900 shares). if holders elect to settle the 2010 purchase contract prior to july 1, 2013, they will receive 1.7361 shares of ppl common stock, subject to antidilution adjustments and an early settlement upon a fundamental change. 296 a holder's ownership interest in the 2018 notes is pledged to ppl to secure the holder's obligation under the related 2010 purchase contract. if a holder of a 2010 purchase contract chooses at any time to no longer be a holder of the 2018 notes, such holder's obligation under the 2010 purchase contract must be secured by a u.s. treasury security. each 2010 purchase contract also requires ppl to make quarterly contract adjustment payments at a rate of 4.875% per year on the $50.00 stated amount of the 2010 equity unit. ppl has the option to defer these contract adjustment payments until the 2010 purchase contract settlement date. deferred contract adjustment payments will accrue additional contract adjustment payments at the rate of 9.5% per year until paid. until any deferred contract adjustment payments have been paid, ppl may not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase or acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock, subject to certain exceptions. the 2018 notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ppl as to payment of principal and interest. the 2018 notes initially bear interest at 4.625% and are not subject to redemption prior to july 2015. beginning july 2015, ppl capital funding may, at its option, redeem the 2018 notes, in whole but not in part, at any time, at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. the 2018 notes are expected to be remarketed in 2013 in two tranches, such that neither tranche will have an aggregate principal amount of less than the lesser of $300 million and 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 notes to be remarketed. one tranche will mature on or about the third anniversary of the settlement of the remarketing, and the other tranche will mature on or about the fifth anniversary of such settlement. the 2018 notes will be remarketed as subordinated, unsecured obligations of ppl capital funding, as ppl capital funding notified the trustee in september 2010 of its irrevocable election to maintain the subordination provisions of the notes and related guarantees in a remarketing. upon a successful remarketing, the interest rate on the 2018 notes may be reset and the maturity of the tranches may be modified as necessary. in connection with a remarketing, ppl capital funding may elect, with respect to each tranche, to extend or eliminate the early redemption date and/or calculate interest on the notes of a tranche on a fixed or floating rate basis. if the remarketing fails, holders of the 2018 notes will have the right to put their notes to ppl capital funding on july 1, 2013 for an amount equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest. prior to july 2013, ppl capital funding may elect at one or more times to defer interest payments on the 2018 notes for one or more consecutive interest periods until the earlier of the third anniversary of the interest payment due date and july 2015. deferred interest payments will accrue additional interest at a rate equal to the interest rate then applicable to the 2018 notes. until any deferred interest payments have been paid, ppl may not, subject to certain exceptions, (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase or acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock, (ii) make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, purchase or redeem any of its debt securities that upon its liquidation ranks equal with, or junior in interest to, the subordinated guarantee of the 2018 notes by ppl as of the date of issuance and (iii) make any payments regarding any guarantee by ppl of securities of any of its subsidiaries (other than ppl capital funding) if the guarantee ranks equal with, or junior in interest to, the 2018 notes as of the date of their issuance. in the financial statements, the proceeds from the sale of the 2010 equity units were allocated to the 2018 notes and the 2010 purchase contracts, including the obligation to make contract adjustment payments, based on the underlying fair value of each instrument at the time of issuance. as a result, the 2018 notes were recorded at $1.150 billion, which approximated fair value, as long-term debt. at the time of issuance, the present value of the contract adjustment payments of $157 million was recorded to other liabilities, representing the obligation to make contract adjustment payments, with an offsetting reduction to additional paid-in capital for the issuance of the 2010 purchase contracts, which approximated the fair value of each. the liability is being accreted through interest expense over the three-year term of the 2010 purchase contracts. the initial valuation of the contract adjustment payments is considered a non-cash transaction that was excluded from the statement of cash flows in 2010. costs to issue the 2010 equity units were primarily allocated on a relative cost basis, resulting in $29 million being recorded to "additional paid-in capital" and $7 million being recorded to "other noncurrent assets" on the balance sheet. see note 4 for eps considerations related to the 2010 purchase contracts. legal separateness (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric and lke) the subsidiaries of ppl are separate legal entities. ppl's subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of ppl. accordingly, creditors of ppl may not satisfy their debts from the assets of ppl's subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay ppl's creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation. similarly, absent a specific contractual undertaking or as required by applicable law or regulation, ppl is not liable for the debts of its subsidiaries, nor are its subsidiaries liable for the debts of one another. accordingly, creditors of ppl's subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of ppl or its other subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by ppl or its other subsidiaries to pay the creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation. 297 similarly, the subsidiaries of ppl energy supply, ppl electric and lke are each separate legal entities. these subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of ppl energy supply, ppl electric and lke. accordingly, creditors of ppl energy supply, ppl electric and lke may not satisfy their debts from the assets of their subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay the creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation. similarly, absent a specific contractual undertaking or as required by applicable law or regulation, ppl energy supply, ppl electric and lke are not liable for the debts of their subsidiaries, nor are their subsidiaries liable for the debts of one another. accordingly, creditors of these subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of ppl energy supply, ppl electric and lke (or their other subsidiaries) absent a specific contractual undertaking by that parent or other subsidiary to pay such creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation. distributions, capital contributions and related restrictions (ppl) in november 2012, ppl declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable january 2, 2013, at 36.0 cents per share (equivalent to $1.44 per annum). in february 2013, ppl declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable april 1, 2013, at 36.75 cents per share (equivalent to $1.47 per annum). future dividends, declared at the discretion of the board of directors, will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors. neither ppl capital funding nor ppl may declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which ppl capital funding defers interest payments on its 2007 series a junior subordinated notes due 2067. subject to certain exceptions, ppl may not declare or pay any dividend or distribution on its capital stock until any deferred interest payments on its 4.625% junior subordinated notes due 2018 and its 4.32% junior subordinated notes due 2019 have been paid and deferred contract adjustment payments on ppl's purchase contracts have been paid. at december 31, 2012, no payments were deferred on any series of junior subordinated notes or the purchase contracts. (ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl relies on dividends or loans from its subsidiaries to fund ppl's dividends to its common shareholders. the net assets of certain ppl subsidiaries are subject to legal restrictions. lke primarily relies on dividends from its subsidiaries to fund its dividends to ppl. lg&amp;e, ku and ppl electric are subject to section 305(a) of the federal power act, which makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds "properly included in capital account." the meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the federal power act. lg&amp;e, ku and ppl electric believe, however, that this statutory restriction, as applied to their circumstances, would not be construed or applied by the ferc to prohibit the payment from retained earnings of dividends that are not excessive and are for lawful and legitimate business purposes. in february 2012, lg&amp;e and ku petitioned the ferc requesting authorization to pay dividends in the future based on retained earnings balances calculated without giving effect to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for the acquisition of lke by ppl. in may 2012, ferc approved the petitions with the further condition that each utility may not pay dividends if such payment would cause its adjusted equity ratio to fall below 30% of total capitalization. accordingly, at december 31, 2012, net assets of $2.3 billion ($893 million for lg&amp;e and $1.4 billion for ku) were restricted for purposes of paying dividends to lke, and net assets of $2.3 billion ($917 million for lg&amp;e and $1.4 billion for ku) were available for payment of dividends to lke. lg&amp;e and ku believe they will not be required to change their current dividend practices as a result of the foregoing requirement. in addition, under virginia law, ku is prohibited from making loans to affiliates without the prior approval of the vscc. there are no comparable statutes under kentucky law applicable to lg&amp;e and ku, or under pennsylvania law applicable to ppl electric. however, orders from the kpsc require lg&amp;e and ku to obtain prior consent or approval before lending amounts to ppl. (ppl and ppl energy supply) the ppl montana colstrip lease places certain restrictions on ppl montana's ability to declare dividends. at this time, ppl believes that these covenants will not limit ppl's or ppl energy supply's ability to operate as desired and will not affect their ability to meet any of their cash obligations. (ppl) wpd subsidiaries have financing arrangements that limit their ability to pay dividends. however, ppl does not, at this time, expect that any of such limitations would significantly impact ppl's ability to meet its cash obligations. 298 (ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the following distributions and capital contributions occurred in 2012: ppl energy ppl supply electric lke lg&amp;e ku dividends/distributions paid to parent/member $ 787 $ 95 $ 155 $ 75 $ 100 capital contributions received from parent/member 563 150 8. ac quisitions, development and divestitures (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with the projects, sell, cancel or expand them, execute tolling agreements or pursue other options. any resulting transactions may impact future financial results. see note 9 for information on ppl energy supply's 2011 distribution of its membership interest in ppl global to its parent, ppl energy funding, which was presented as discontinued operations by ppl energy supply, and the sales of businesses in 2011 and prior years that were presented as discontinued operations by ppl, ppl energy supply and lke. see note 10 for information on ppl's and ppl energy supply's 2012 ironwood acquisition and ppl's 2011 acquisition of wpd midlands and 2010 acquisition of lke. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) acquisition terminated bluegrass cts acquisition in september 2011, lg&amp;e and ku entered into an asset purchase agreement with bluegrass generation for the purchase of the bluegrass cts, aggregating approximately 495 mw, plus limited associated contractual arrangements required for operation of the units, for a purchase price of $110 million, pending receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. in may 2012, the kpsc issued an order approving the request to purchase the bluegrass cts. in november 2011, lg&amp;e and ku filed an application with the ferc under the federal power act requesting approval to purchase the bluegrass cts. in may 2012, the ferc issued an order conditionally authorizing the acquisition of the bluegrass cts, subject to approval by the ferc of satisfactory mitigation measures to address market-power concerns. after a review of potentially available mitigation options, lg&amp;e and ku determined that the options were not commercially justifiable. in june 2012, lg&amp;e and ku terminated the asset purchase agreement for the bluegrass cts in accordance with its terms and made applicable filings with the kpsc and ferc. development cane run unit 7 construction in september 2011, lg&amp;e and ku filed a cpcn with the kpsc requesting approval to build cane run unit 7. in may 2012, the kpsc issued an order approving the request. lg&amp;e will own a 22% undivided interest, and ku will own a 78% undivided interest in the new generating unit. a formal request for recovery of the costs associated with the construction was not included in the cpcn filing with the kpsc but is expected to be included in future rate proceedings. lg&amp;e and ku commenced preliminary construction activities in the third quarter of 2012 and project construction is expected to be completed by may 2015. the project, which includes building a natural gas supply pipeline and related transmission projects, has an estimated cost of approximately $600 million. in conjunction with this construction and to meet new, more stringent epa regulations with a 2015 compliance date, lg&amp;e and ku anticipate retiring five older coal-fired electric generating units at the cane run and green river plants, which have a combined summer capacity rating of 726 mw. in addition, ku retired the remaining 71 mw unit at the tyrone plant in february 2013. 299 future capacity needs in addition to the construction of a combined cycle gas unit at the cane run station, lg&amp;e and ku continue to assess future capacity needs. as a part of the assessment, lg&amp;e and ku issued an rfp in september 2012 for up to 700 mw of capacity beginning as early as 2015. (ppl and ppl energy supply) hydroelectric expansion projects in 2009, in light of the availability of tax incentives and potential federal loan guarantees for renewable projects contained in the economic stimulus package, ppl energy supply filed an application with the ferc to expand capacity at its holtwood hydroelectric plant, which the ferc approved. the project's expected cost is $443 million. construction continues on the project, with commercial operations scheduled to begin in 2013. at december 31, 2012, expected remaining expenditures are $84 million. in 2009, ppl montana received ferc approval for its request to redevelop the rainbow hydroelectric facility at great falls, montana. the project's expected cost is $209 million. commercial operations is scheduled to begin in 2013. at december 31, 2012, expected remaining expenditures were insignificant. ppl energy supply believes that it is qualified for either investment tax credits or treasury grants for the projects at the holtwood and rainbow facilities. ppl energy supply has recognized investment tax credits and continues to evaluate whether to seek treasury grants in lieu of the credits. during 2012, 2011 and 2010, ppl energy supply recorded deferred investment tax credits of $40 million, $52 million and $52 million. ppl energy supply anticipates recognizing an additional $23 million in investment tax credits for tax year 2013. these credits reduce ppl energy supply's tax liability and will be amortized over the life of the related assets. bell bend cola in 2008, a ppl energy supply subsidiary, ppl bell bend, llc (ppl bell bend) submitted a cola to the nrc for the proposed bell bend nuclear generating unit (bell bend) to be built adjacent to the susquehanna plant. also in 2008, the cola was formally docketed and accepted for review by the nrc. ppl bell bend continues to respond to questions from the nrc regarding technical and site specific information provided in the initial cola and subsequent amendments. ppl bell bend does not expect to complete the cola review process with the nrc prior to 2015. in 2008, ppl bell bend submitted parts i and ii of an application for a federal loan guarantee for bell bend to the doe. the doe is expected in the first half of 2013 to finalize the first nuclear loan guarantee for a project in georgia. eight of the ten applicants that submitted part ii applications remain active in the doe program; however, the doe has stated that the $18.5 billion currently appropriated to support new nuclear projects would not likely be enough for more than three projects. ppl bell bend submits quarterly application updates for bell bend to the doe to remain active in the loan guarantee application process. ppl bell bend has made no decision to proceed with construction of bell bend and expects that such decision will not be made for several years given the anticipated lengthy nrc license approval process. additionally, ppl bell bend does not expect to proceed with construction absent favorable economics, a joint arrangement with other interested parties and a federal loan guarantee or other acceptable financing. ppl bell bend is currently authorized to spend up to $205 million through 2015 on the cola and other permitting costs necessary for construction, which is expected to be sufficient to fund the project through receipt of the license. at december 31, 2012 and 2011, $154 million and $131 million of costs, which includes capitalized interest, associated with the licensing application were capitalized and are included on the balance sheets in noncurrent "other intangibles." ppl bell bend believes that the estimated fair value of the cola currently exceeds the costs expected to be capitalized for the licensing application. regional transmission line expansion plan (ppl and ppl electric) susquehanna-roseland in 2007, pjm directed the construction of a new 150-mile, 500-kilovolt transmission line between the susquehanna substation in pennsylvania and the roseland substation in new jersey that it identified as essential to long-term reliability of the mid-atlantic electricity grid. pjm determined that the line was needed to prevent potential overloads that could occur on several existing transmission lines in the interconnected pjm system. pjm directed ppl electric to construct the portion of 300 the susquehanna-roseland line in pennsylvania and public service electric &amp; gas company to construct the portion of the line in new jersey. on october 1, 2012, the national park service (nps) issued its record of decision (rod) on the proposed susquehanna-roseland transmission line affirming the route chosen by ppl electric and public service electric &amp; gas company as the preferred alternative under the nps's national environmental policy act review. on october 15, 2012, a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of columbia by various environmental groups, including the sierra club, challenging the rod and seeking to prohibit its implementation, and on december 6, 2012, the groups filed a petition for injunctive relief seeking to prohibit all construction activities until the court issues a final decision on the complaint. ppl electric has intervened in the lawsuit. the chosen route had previously been approved by the puc and the new jersey board of public utilities. on december 13, 2012, ppl electric received federal construction and right of way permits to build on national park service lands. construction activities have begun on portions of the 101-mile route in pennsylvania. the line is expected to be completed before the peak summer demand period of 2015. at december 31, 2012, ppl electric's estimated share of the project cost was $560 million. ppl and ppl electric cannot predict the ultimate outcome or timing of any legal challenges to the project or what additional actions, if any, pjm might take in the event of a further delay to the scheduled in-service date for the new line. northeast/pocono in october 2012, the ferc issued an order in response to ppl electric's december 2011 request for ratemaking incentives for the northeast/pocono reliability project (a new 58-mile 230 kv transmission line, three new substations and upgrades to adjacent facilities). the incentives were specifically tailored to address the risks and challenges ppl electric will face in building the project. the ferc granted the incentive for inclusion of all prudently incurred construction work in progress (cwip) costs in rate base and denied the request for a 100 basis point adder to the return on equity incentive. the order required a follow-up compliance filing from ppl electric to ensure proper accounting treatment of afudc and cwip for the project, which ppl electric will submit with the ferc in march 2013. ppl electric expects the project to be completed in 2017. at december 31, 2012, ppl electric estimates the total project costs to be approximately $200 million with approximately $190 million qualifying for the cwip incentive. 9. discontinued operations (ppl and ppl energy supply) sale of certain non-core generation facilities in 2011, ppl energy supply subsidiaries completed the sale of their ownership interests in certain non-core generation facilities, which were included in the supply segment, for $381 million. the transaction included the natural gas-fired facilities in wallingford, connecticut and university park, illinois and an equity interest in safe harbor water power corporation, which owns a hydroelectric facility in conestoga, pennsylvania. these non-core generation facilities met the held for sale criteria in the third quarter of 2010. as a result, a pre-tax impairment charge of $96 million ($58 million after tax) was recorded and $5 million ($4 million after tax) of allocated goodwill was written off. these charges are included in "income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes)" on the 2010 statements of income. following are the components of discontinued operations in the statements of income. 2011 2010 operating revenues $ 19 $ 113 operating expenses (a) 11 156 operating income (loss) 8 (43) other income (expense) - net 2 interest expense (b) 3 11 income (loss) before income taxes 5 (52) income tax expense (benefit) 3 (18) income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 2 $ (34) 301 (a) 2010 includes the impairments to the carrying value of the non-core generation facilities and the write-off of allocated goodwill. (b) represents allocated interest expense based upon debt attributable to the generation facilities sold. sale of long island generation business in 2010, ppl energy supply subsidiaries completed the sale of the long island generation business, which was included in the supply segment. proceeds from the sale approximated $124 million. there was no significant impact on earnings in 2010 from the operation of this business or as a result of the sale. sale of maine hydroelectric generation business in 2010, a ppl energy supply subsidiary completed the sale of its maine hydroelectric generation business, which was included in the supply segment. the business included eight hydroelectric facilities as well as a 50% equity interest in another hydroelectric facility. the majority of the business was sold in 2009. the remaining three hydroelectric facilities were sold in 2010 for $24 million, and also resulted in the receipt of an additional $14 million in contingent consideration in connection with the 2009 sale. as a result of the consideration received in 2010, ppl energy supply recorded a gain of $25 million ($15 million after tax), reflected in "income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes)" on the 2010 statement of income. distribution of membership interest in ppl global to parent (ppl energy supply) in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its entire membership interest in ppl global, which represented the entire u.k. regulated segment, to ppl energy supply's parent, ppl energy funding. the distribution was made based on the book value of the assets and liabilities of ppl global with financial effect as of january 1, 2011, and no gains or losses were recognized on the distribution. the purpose of the distribution was to better align ppl's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages these businesses, separating the u.s.-based competitive energy marketing and supply business from the u.k.-based regulated electricity distribution business. following the distribution, ppl energy supply operates in a single reportable segment, and through its subsidiaries is primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of power, primarily in the northeastern and northwestern u.s. following are the components of discontinued operations in the statement of income. 2010 operating revenues $ 761 operating expenses 368 operating income 393 other income (expense) - net 4 interest expense (a) 135 income before income taxes 262 income tax expense 1 income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 261 (a) no interest was allocated, as ppl global was sufficiently capitalized. the amount of cash and cash equivalents of ppl global at the time of the distribution was reflected as a financing activity in the 2011 statement of cash flows. wke (ppl and lke) wke had a 25-year lease for and operated generating facilities of brec, and a coal-fired generating facility owned by the city of henderson, kentucky. wke terminated the lease in 2009 prior to ppl acquiring lke. see note 15 for additional information related to the termination of the lease. in 2012, an adjustment was made to the liability for certain wke indemnifications, which is reflected in discontinued operations. see "guarantees and other assurances" in note 15 for additional information on the adjustment and related indemnification. the results of operations for the 2012, 2011 and 2010 periods were not significant. 302 10. business acquisitions ironwood acquisition (ppl and ppl energy supply) on april 13, 2012, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of ppl energy supply completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of two subsidiaries of the aes corporation, aes ironwood, l.l.c. (subsequently renamed ppl ironwood, llc) and aes prescott, l.l.c. (subsequently renamed ppl prescott, llc), which own and operate, respectively, the ironwood facility. the ironwood facility began operation in 2001 and, since 2008, ppl energyplus has supplied natural gas for the facility and received the facility's full electricity output and capacity value pursuant to a tolling agreement that expires in 2021. the acquisition provides ppl energy supply, through its subsidiaries, operational control of additional combined-cycle gas generation in pjm. the fair value of the consideration paid for this acquisition was as follows. aggregate enterprise consideration $ 326 less: fair value of long-term debt outstanding assumed through consolidation (a) 258 plus: restricted cash debt service reserves 17 cash consideration paid for equity interests (including working capital adjustments) $ 85 (a) the long-term debt assumed through consolidation consisted of $226 million aggregate principal amount of 8.857% senior secured bonds to be fully repaid by 2025, plus $8 million of debt service reserve loans, and a $24 million fair value adjustment. purchase price allocation the following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed through consolidation, and the effective settlement of the tolling agreement through consolidation. pp&amp;e $ 505 long-term debt (current and noncurrent) (a) (258) tolling agreement (b) (170) other net assets (a) 8 net identifiable assets acquired $ 85 (a) represents non-cash activity excluded from the 2012 statement of cash flows. ( b ) prior to the acquisition, ppl energyplus had recorded primarily an intangible asset , which represented its rights to and the related accounting for the tolling agreement with ppl ironwood, llc. on the acquisition date, ppl ironwood, llc recorded a liability, recognized at fair value, for its obligation to ppl energyplus. the tolling agreement assets of ppl energyplus and the tolling agreement liability of ppl ironwood, llc eliminate in consolidation for ppl and ppl energy supply as a result of the acquisition, and therefore the agreement is considered effectively settled. the difference between the tolling agreement assets and liability resulted in an insignificant loss on the effective settlement of the agreement . during the fourth quarter of 2012, the purchase price allocation was finalized with no material adjustments made to the preliminary valuation. acquisition of wpd midlands (ppl ) on april 1, 2011, ppl, through its indirect, wholly owned subsidiary ppl wem, completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding ordinary share capital of central networks east plc and central networks limited, the sole owner of central networks west plc, together with certain other related assets and liabilities (collectively referred to as central networks and subsequently renamed wpd midlands), from subsidiaries of e.on ag. the consideration for the acquisition consisted of cash of $5.8 billion, including the repayment of $1.7 billion of affiliate indebtedness owed to subsidiaries of e.on ag, and approximately $800 million of long-term debt assumed through consolidation. wpd midlands operates two regulated distribution networks that serve five million end-users in the midlands area of england. the acquisition increased the regulated portion of ppl's business and enhances rate-regulated growth opportunities as the regulated businesses make investments to improve infrastructure and customer reliability. further, since the service territories of wpd (south wales), wpd (south west) and wpd midlands are contiguous, cost savings, efficiencies and other benefits are achieved from the combined operations of these entities. the fair value of the consideration paid for this acquisition was as follows (in billions). 303 aggregate enterprise consideration $ 6.6 less: fair value of long-term debt outstanding assumed through consolidation 0.8 total cash consideration paid 5.8 less: funds used to repay pre-acquisition affiliate indebtedness 1.7 cash consideration paid for central networks' outstanding ordinary share capital $ 4.1 the total cash consideration paid was primarily funded by borrowings under the 2011 bridge facility on the date of acquisition. subsequently, ppl repaid those borrowings in 2011 using proceeds from the permanent financing, including issuances of common stock and 2011 equity units, as well as proceeds from the issuance of debt by ppl wem, wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands). see note 7 for additional information. purchase price allocation the following table summarizes (in billions) the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. current assets (a) $ 0.2 pp&amp;e 4.9 intangible assets 0.1 other noncurrent assets 0.1 current liabilities (b) (0.4) ppl wem affiliate indebtedness (1.7) long-term debt (current and noncurrent) (b) (0.8) other noncurrent liabilities (b) (0.7) net identifiable assets acquired 1.7 goodwill 2.4 net assets acquired $ 4.1 (a) includes gross contractual amount of the accounts receivable acquired of $122 million, which approximates fair value. (b) represents non-cash activity excluded from the 2011 statement of cash flows. the purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of $2.4 billion that was assigned to the u.k. regulated segment. the goodwill is attributable to the expected continued growth of a rate-regulated business with a defined service area operating under a constructive regulatory framework, expected cost savings, efficiencies and other benefits resulting from a contiguous service area with wpd (south west) and wpd (south wales), as well as the ability to leverage wpd (south west)'s and wpd (south wales)'s existing management team's high level of performance in capital cost efficiency, system reliability and customer service. the goodwill is not deductible for u.k. income tax purposes. separation benefits - u.k. regulated segment in connection with the 2011 acquisition, ppl completed a reorganization designed to transition wpd midlands from a functional operating structure to a regional operating structure requiring a smaller combined support structure, reducing duplication and implementing more efficient procedures. as a result of the reorganization, 729 employees of wpd midlands have been terminated. the separation benefits, before income taxes, associated with the reorganization are as follows. severance compensation $ 61 early retirement deficiency costs (erdc) under applicable pension plans 46 outplacement services 1 total separation benefits $ 108 in connection with the reorganization, wpd midlands recorded $93 million of the total expected separation benefits in 2011, of which $48 million related to severance compensation and $45 million related to erdc. wpd midlands recorded an additional $15 million of total separation benefits in 2012, of which $13 million related to severance compensation and $2 million related to erdc. the accrued severance compensation is reflected in "other current liabilities" and the erdc reduced "other noncurrent assets" on the balance sheets. all separation benefits are included in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income. 304 the changes in the carrying amounts of accrued severance were as follows. 2012 2011 accrued severance at beginning of period $ 21 severance compensation 13 $ 48 severance paid (34) (27) accrued severance at end of period $ $ 21 in addition to the reorganization costs noted above, an additional $9 million was recorded in 2011 for erdc payable under applicable pension plans and severance compensation for certain employees who separated from the wpd midlands companies, but were not part of the reorganization. these separation benefits are also included in "other operation and maintenance" on the statement of income. other wpd midlands 2011 financial results included in ppl's statement of income and included in the u.k. regulated segment were as follows. operating revenues $ 790 net income attributable to ppl shareowners 137 pro forma information the pro forma financial information, which includes lke, discussed below, as if the acquisition had occurred january 1, 2009 and wpd midlands as if the acquisition had occurred january 1, 2010, is as follows. 2011 2010 operating revenues - ppl consolidated pro forma (unaudited) $ 13,140 $ 11,850 net income attributable to ppl shareowners - ppl consolidated pro forma (unaudited) 1,800 1,462 the pro forma financial information presented above has been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of ppl and lke, which was acquired on november 1, 2010, and from the historical combined financial statements of wpd midlands, which was acquired on april 1, 2011. income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes), which was not significant for 2011 and was $(18) million for 2010, were excluded from the pro forma amounts above. the pro forma financial information presented above includes adjustments to depreciation, net periodic pension costs, interest expense and the related income tax effects to reflect the impact of the acquisition. the pre-tax nonrecurring credits (expenses) presented in the following table were directly attributable to the wpd midlands and lke acquisitions and adjustments were included in the calculation of pro forma operating revenue and net income to remove the effect of these nonrecurring items and the related income tax effects. income statement line item 2011 2010 wpd midlands acquisition 2011 bridge facility costs (a) interest expense $ (44) foreign currency loss on 2011 bridge facility (b) other income (expense) -

(b) the 2011 bridge facility was denominated in gbp. the amount includes a $42 million foreign currency loss on ppl capital funding's repayment of its 2011 bridge facility borrowing and a $15 million foreign currency loss associated with proceeds received on the u.s. dollar-denominated senior notes issued by ppl wem in april 2011 that were used to repay a portion of ppl wem's borrowing under the 2011 bridge facility. (c) the repayment of borrowings on the 2011 bridge facility was economically hedged to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates with forward contracts to purchase gbp, which resulted in net hedge gains. 305 (d) the hedge ineffectiveness includes a combination of ineffectiveness associated with closed out interest rate swaps and a charge recorded as a result of certain interest rate swaps failing hedge effectiveness testing, both associated with the acquisition financing. (e) the u.k. stamp duty tax represents a tax on the transfer of ownership of property in the u.k. incurred in connection with the acquisition.

(i) primarily includes acquisition-related advisory, accounting and legal fees. acquisition of lke (ppl) on november 1, 2010, ppl completed the acquisition of all of the limited liability company interests of e.on u.s. llc from a wholly owned subsidiary of e.on ag. upon completion of the acquisition, e.on u.s. llc was renamed lg&amp;e and ku energy llc (lke). lke is a holding company with regulated utility operations conducted through its subsidiaries, lg&amp;e and ku. the acquisition reapportions the mix of ppl's regulated and competitive businesses by increasing the regulated portion of its business, strengthens ppl's credit profile and enhances rate-regulated growth opportunities as the regulated businesses make investments to improve infrastructure and customer reliability. the fair value of the consideration paid for this acquisition was as follows (in billions). aggregate enterprise consideration $ 7.6 less: fair value of assumed long-term debt outstanding, net 0.8 total cash consideration paid 6.8 less: funds used to repay pre-acquisition affiliate indebtedness 4.3 cash consideration paid for e.on u.s. llc equity interests $ 2.5 the total cash consideration paid, including repayment of affiliate indebtedness, was funded by ppl's june 2010 issuance of $3.6 billion of common stock and 2010 equity units that provided proceeds totaling $3.5 billion, net of underwriting discounts, $3.2 billion of borrowings under an existing credit facility in october 2010, $249 million of proceeds from the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts in july 2010 and cash on hand. see note 7 for additional information on the issuance of common stock and 2010 equity units and the october 2010 borrowing under ppl energy supply's syndicated credit facility that provided interim financing to partially fund the acquisition. see note 19 for additional information on the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts. purchase price allocation the following table summarizes (in billions) the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. current assets (a) $ 0.9 pp&amp;e 7.5 other intangibles (current and noncurrent) 0.4 regulatory and other noncurrent assets 0.7 current liabilities, excluding current portion of long-term debt (b) (0.5) ppl affiliate indebtedness (c) (4.3) long-term debt (current and noncurrent) (b) (0.9) other noncurrent liabilities (b) (2.3) net identifiable assets acquired 1.5 goodwill 1.0 net assets acquired $ 2.5 (a) includes gross contractual amount of the accounts receivable acquired of $186 million. ppl expected $11 million to be uncollectible; however, credit risk is mitigated since uncollectible accounts are a component of customer rates. (b) represents non-cash activity excluded from the 2010 statement of cash flows. (c) includes $1.6 billion designated as a capital contribution to lke. for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the $996 million of goodwill was assigned to the ppl reportable segments expected to benefit from the acquisition. both the kentucky regulated and the supply segments are expected to benefit and the assignment of goodwill was $662 million to the kentucky regulated segment and $334 million to the supply segment. the goodwill at the kentucky regulated segment reflects the value paid for the expected continued growth of a rate-regulated business located in a defined service area with a constructive regulatory environment, the ability of lke to leverage its assembled workforce to take advantage of those growth opportunities and the attractiveness of stable, growing cash flows. although no other assets or liabilities from the acquisition were assigned to the supply segment, the supply 306 segment obtained a synergistic benefit attributed to the overall de-risking of the ppl portfolio, which enhanced ppl energy supply's credit profile, thereby increasing the value of the supply segment. this increase in value resulted in the assignment of goodwill to the supply segment. the goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. as such, no deferred taxes were recorded related to goodwill. see note 9 and the "guarantees and other assurances" section of note 15 for additional information on certain indemnifications provided by lke, the most significant of which relates to the discontinued operations of wke. the 2010 lke financial results included in ppl's statement of income and included in the kentucky regulated segment were as follows. net income (loss) attributable operating to ppl revenues shareowners from november 1, 2010 - december 31, 2010 $ 493 $ 47 (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) in november 2010, lke, lg&amp;e and ku issued debt totaling $2.9 billion, of which lke used $100 million to return capital to ppl. the majority of these proceeds, together with a borrowing by lg&amp;e under its available credit facilities, were used to repay borrowings from a ppl energy supply subsidiary. such borrowings were incurred to permit lke to repay certain indebtedness owed to affiliates of e.on ag upon the closing of the acquisition. in november 2010, ppl energy supply used the above-referenced amounts received from lke, together with other cash on hand, to repay approximately $3.0 billion of its october 2010 borrowing under existing credit facilities. (ppl and ppl energy supply) to ensure adequate funds were available for the acquisition, in july 2010, ppl energy supply monetized certain full-requirement sales contracts that resulted in cash proceeds of $249 million. see "commodity price risk (non-trading) - monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts" in note 19 for additional information. additionally, ppl energy supply received proceeds in 2011 from the sale of certain non-core generation facilities, which were used to repay the short-term borrowings drawn on existing credit facilities. see "sale of certain non-core generation facilities" in note 9 for additional information. as a result of the monetization of these full-requirement sales contracts, coupled with the expected net proceeds from the then-anticipated sale of these non-core generation facilities, debt that had been planned to be issued by ppl energy supply in late 2010 was no longer needed. therefore, hedge accounting associated with interest rate swaps entered into by ppl in anticipation of a debt issuance by ppl energy supply was discontinued. net gains (losses) of $(29) million, or $(19) million after tax, were reclassified from aoci to "other income (expense) - net" on ppl's 2010 statement of income. (lke, lg&amp;e and ku) on november 1, 2010, ppl completed its acquisition of lke and its subsidiaries. the push-down basis of accounting was used to record the fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities on lke at the acquisition date. ppl paid cash consideration for the equity interests in lke and its subsidiaries of $2,493 million and provided a capital contribution on november 1, 2010, of $1,565 million; included within this was the consideration paid of $1,702 million for lg&amp;e and $2,656 million for ku. the allocation of the purchase price was based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the push-down accounting for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows (in millions). 307 lke lg&amp;e ku current assets $ 969 $ 503 $ 341 investments 31 1 30 pp&amp;e 7,469 2,935 4,531 other intangibles (current and noncurrent) 427 226 201 regulatory and other noncurrent assets 689 416 274 current liabilities, excluding current portion of long-term debt (516) (420) (367) ppl affiliate indebtedness (4,349) (485) (1,331) long-term debt (current and noncurrent) (934) (580) (352) other noncurrent liabilities (2,289) (1,283) (1,278) net identifiable assets acquired 1,497 1,313 2,049 goodwill 996 389 607 net assets acquired 2,493 1,702 2,656 capital contribution on november 1, 2010, to replace affiliate indebtedness 1,565 beginning equity balance on november 1, 2010 $ 4,058 $ 1,702 $ 2,656 goodwill represents value paid for the rate regulated businesses of lg&amp;e and ku, which are located in a defined service area with a constructive regulatory environment, which provides for future investment, earnings and cash flow growth, as well as the talented and experienced workforce. lg&amp;e's and ku's franchise values are being attributed to the going concern value of the business, and thus were recorded as goodwill rather than a separately identifiable intangible asset. none of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes or included in customer rates. adjustments to lke's, lg&amp;e's and ku's assets and liabilities that contributed to goodwill are as follows: the fair value adjustment on the eei investment was calculated using the discounted cash flow valuation method. the result was an increase in ku's value of the investment in eei; the fair value of eei was calculated to be $30 million and a fair value adjustment of $18 million was recorded on ku. the fair value adjustment to eei was being amortized over the expected remaining useful life of plant and equipment at eei, which was estimated to be over 20 years. during the fourth quarter of 2012, ku recorded an impairment in eei. see notes 1 and 18 for additional information. the pollution control bonds, excluding the reacquired bonds, had a fair value adjustment of $7 million for lg&amp;e and $1 million for ku. all variable bonds were valued at par while the fixed rate bonds were valued with a yield curve based on average credit spreads for similar bonds. as a result of the purchase accounting associated with the acquisition, the following items had a fair value adjustment but no effect on goodwill as the offset was either a regulatory asset or liability. the regulatory asset or liability has been recorded to eliminate any ratemaking impact of the fair value adjustments: the value of ovec was determined to be $126 million based upon an announced transaction by another owner. lg&amp;e and ku's combined investment in ovec was not significant and the power purchase agreement was valued at $87 million for lg&amp;e and $39 million for ku. an intangible asset was recorded with the offset to regulatory liability and is amortized using the units of production method until march 2026, the expiration date of the agreement at the date of the acquisition. lg&amp;e and ku each recorded an emission allowance intangible asset and a regulatory liability as the result of adjusting the fair value of the emission allowances at lg&amp;e and ku. the emission allowance intangible of $8 million at lg&amp;e and $9 million at ku represents allocated and purchased sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowances that were unused as of the valuation date or allocated for use in future years. lg&amp;e and ku had previously recorded emission allowances as other materials and supplies. to conform to ppl's accounting policy all emission allowances are now recorded as intangible assets. the emission allowance intangible asset is amortized as the emission allowances are consumed, which is expected to occur through 2040. coal contract intangible assets were recorded at lg&amp;e for $124 million and at ku for $145 million as well as a non-current liability of $11 million for lg&amp;e and $22 million for ku on the balance sheets. an offsetting regulatory asset was recorded for those contracts with unfavorable terms relative to market. an offsetting regulatory liability was recorded for those contracts that had favorable terms relative to market. all coal contracts held by lg&amp;e and ku, wherein it had entered into arrangements to buy amounts of coal at fixed prices from counterparties at a future date, were fair valued. the intangible assets and other liabilities, as well as the regulatory assets and liabilities, are being amortized over the same terms as the related contracts, which expire through 2016. 308 adjustments on november 1, 2010 were made to record lke pension assets at fair value, remeasure its pension and postretirement benefit obligations at current discount rates and eliminate accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). an increase of $4 million in the liability balances of lg&amp;e and ku was recorded, due to the lowering of the discount rate; this was credited to their respective pension and postretirement liability balances with offsetting adjustments made to the related regulatory assets and liabilities. the fair value of intangible assets and liabilities (e.g. contracts that have favorable or unfavorable terms relative to market), including coal contracts and power purchase agreements, as well as emission allowances, have been reflected on the balance sheets with offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities. prior to the acquisition, lg&amp;e and ku recovered the cost of the coal contracts, power purchases and emission allowances and this rate treatment will continue after the acquisition. as a result, management believes the regulatory assets and liabilities created to offset the fair value adjustments meet the recognition criteria established by existing accounting guidance and eliminate any ratemaking impact of the fair value adjustments. lg&amp;e's and ku's customer rates will continue to reflect these items (e.g. coal, purchased power, emission allowances) at their original contracted prices. lg&amp;e and ku also considered whether a separate fair value should be assigned to lg&amp;e's and ku's rights to operate within its various electric and natural gas distribution service areas but concluded that these rights only provided the opportunity to earn a regulated return and barriers to market entry, which in management's judgment is not considered a separately identifiable intangible asset under applicable accounting guidance; rather, it is considered going-concern value, or goodwill. kentucky acquisition commitments (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) in connection with the september 2010 approval of ppl's acquisition of lke, lg&amp;e and ku agreed to implement the acquisition savings sharing deferral (assd) methodology whereby lg&amp;e's and ku's adjusted jurisdictional revenues, expenses, and net operating income are calculated each year. if lg&amp;e's or ku's actual earned rate of return on common equity exceeds 10.75%, half of the excess amount will be deferred as a regulatory liability and ultimately returned to customers. the first assd filing with the kpsc was made on march 30, 2012 based on the 2011 calendar year. on july 2, 2012, the kpsc issued an order approving the calculations contained in the 2011 assd filing and determined that such calculations produced no deferral amounts for the purpose of establishing regulatory liabilities and are proper and in accordance with the settlement agreement. the assd methodology for each of lg&amp;e's and ku's utility operations terminated on january 1, 2013, when new rates went into effect. therefore, no further assd filings will be made. 11. leases lessee transactions (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) e.w. brown combustion turbines lg&amp;e and ku are participants in a sale-leaseback transaction involving two combustion turbines at the e.w. brown generating plant. in december 1999, after selling their interests in the combustion turbines, lg&amp;e and ku entered into an 18-year lease of the turbines. lg&amp;e and ku provided funds to fully defease the lease including the repurchase price and have the right to exercise an early purchase option contained in the lease after 15.5 years, which will occur in 2015. the financial statement treatment of this transaction is the same as if lg&amp;e and ku had retained their ownership interest. since the lease was defeased, there are no remaining minimum lease payments and all related pp&amp;e is reflected on the balance sheets. see note 14 for the balances included on the balance sheets related to this transaction. depreciation expense was insignificant for all periods presented. upon a default under the lease, lg&amp;e and ku are obligated to pay to the lessor their share of certain amounts. primary events of default include loss or destruction of the combustion turbines, failure to insure or maintain the combustion turbines and unwinding of the transaction due to governmental actions. no events of default currently exist with respect to the lease. upon any termination of the lease, whether by default or expiration of its term, title to the combustion turbines reverts to lg&amp;e and ku. the maximum aggregate amount at december 31, 2012 that could be required to be paid by lke is $5 million, by lg&amp;e is $2 million and by ku is $3 million. lke has guaranteed the payment of these potential default payments of lg&amp;e and ku. 309 (ppl and ppl energy supply) colstrip generating plant in july 2000, ppl montana sold its interest in the colstrip generating plants to owner lessors who lease back to ppl montana, under four 36-year non-cancelable leases, a 50% interest in colstrip units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in unit 3. this transaction is accounted for as a sale-leaseback and classified as an operating lease. ppl montana is responsible for its share of the operating expenses associated with its leasehold interests. see note 14 for information on the sharing agreement for colstrip units 3 and 4. ppl montana currently amortizes material leasehold improvements over no more than the remaining life of the original leases; however, the leases provide two renewal options based on the economic useful life of the generation assets. the leases place certain restrictions on ppl montana's ability to incur additional debt, sell assets and declare dividends and require ppl montana to maintain certain financial ratios related to cash flow and net worth. there are no residual value guarantees in these leases. however, upon an event of default or an event of loss, ppl montana could be required to pay a termination value of amounts sufficient to allow the lessor to repay amounts owing on the lessor notes and make the lessor whole for its equity investment and anticipated return on investment. the events of default include payment defaults, breaches of representations or covenants, acceleration of other indebtedness of ppl montana, change in control of ppl montana and certain bankruptcy events. the termination value was estimated to be $301 million at december 31, 2012. kerr dam under the kerr hydroelectric project no. 5 joint operating license issued by the ferc, ppl montana is responsible to make payments to the confederated salish and kootenai tribes of the flathead nation for the use of certain of their tribal lands in connection with the operation of kerr dam. this payment arrangement, subject to escalation based upon inflation, extends until the end of the license term in 2035. between 2015 and 2025, the tribes have the option to purchase, hold and operate the project, at a conveyance price to be determined in accordance with the provisions in the ferc license. exercise of the option by the tribes would result in the termination of this payment arrangement obligation for ppl montana. the payment arrangement has been treated as an operating lease for accounting purposes. in february 2013, the parties to the license submitted the issue of the appropriate amount of the conveyance price to arbitration. (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) other leases ppl and its subsidiaries have entered into various agreements for the lease of office space, vehicles, land gas storage and other equipment.

incorporates the following changes: eliminates the potential to pay dividend equivalents on stock options. eliminates the automatic lapse of restrictions on all equity awards in the event of a "potential" change in control and requires that a termination of employment occur in the event of a change in control before restrictions lapse. changes the treatment of outstanding stock options upon retirement to limit the exercise period to the earlier of the end of the term (ten years from grant) or five years after retirement. to further align the executives' interests with those of ppl shareowners, this plan provides that each restricted stock unit entitles the executive to accrue additional restricted stock units equal to the amount of quarterly dividends paid on ppl stock. these additional restricted stock units would be deferred and payable in shares of ppl common stock at the end of the restriction period. dividend equivalents on restricted stock unit awards prior to 2013 are currently paid in cash when dividends are declared by ppl. under the icp, sip and the icpke (together, the plans), restricted shares of ppl common stock, restricted stock units, performance units and stock options may be granted to officers and other key employees of ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke and other affiliated companies. awards under the plans are made by the compensation, governance and nominating committee (cgnc) of the ppl board of directors, in the case of the icp and sip, and by the ppl corporate leadership council (clc), in the case of the icpke. the following table details the award limits under each of the plans. annual grant limit annual grant limit total as % of for individual participants - total plan outstanding annual grant performance based awards

the total plan award limit was reached and the icp was replaced by the sip. any portion of these awards that has not been granted may be carried over and used in any subsequent year. if any award lapses, is forfeited or the rights of the participant terminate, the shares of ppl common stock underlying such an award are again available for grant. shares delivered under the plans may be in the form of authorized and unissued ppl common stock, common stock held in treasury by ppl or ppl common stock purchased on the open market (including private purchases) in accordance with applicable securities laws. 311 restricted stock and restricted stock units restricted shares of ppl common stock are outstanding shares with full voting and dividend rights. restricted stock awards are granted as a retention award for select key executives and vest when the recipient reaches a certain age or meets service or other criteria set forth in the executive's restricted stock award agreement. the shares are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death of employees. restricted shares vest fully, in certain situations, as defined by each of the plans. the plans allow for the grant of restricted stock units. restricted stock units are awards based on the fair value of ppl common stock on the date of grant. actual ppl common shares will be issued upon completion of a vesting period, generally three years. the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant. recipients of restricted stock and restricted stock units may also be granted the right to receive dividend equivalents through the end of the restriction period or until the award is forfeited. restricted stock and restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under the plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death of employees. restricted stock and restricted stock units vest fully, in certain situations, as defined by each of the plans. the weighted-average grant

encourage and award future performance. performance units represent a target number of shares (target award) of ppl's common stock that the recipient would receive upon ppl's attainment of the applicable performance goal. performance is determined based on total shareowner return during a 3-year performance period. at the end of the period, payout is determined by comparing ppl's performance to the total shareowner return of the companies included in an index group, in the case of the 2010 and 2011 awards, the s&amp;p 500 electric utilities index, and in the case of the 2012 awards, the philadelphia electric utilities index. awards granted in 2010 are payable on a graduated basis within the following ranges: if ppl's performance is at or above the 85th percentile of the index group, the award is paid at 200% of the target award; at the 50th percentile of the index group, the award is paid at 100% of the target award; at the 40th percentile of the index group, the award is paid at 50% of the target award; and below the 40th percentile, no award is payable. awards granted in 2011 and 2012 are payable on a graduated basis similar to 2010, except that the 2011 awards provide for a minimum payment at 25% of the target award if performance falls below the 40th percentile of the index group, and in 2012 the minimum payment was eliminated, with no award payable if performance falls below the 25th percentile. dividends payable during the performance cycle accumulate and are converted into additional performance units and are payable in shares of ppl common stock upon completion of the performance period based on the determination of the cgnc of whether the performance goals have been achieved. under the plan provisions, performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment except for retirement, disability or death of an employee, in which case the total performance units remain outstanding and are eligible for vesting through the conclusion of the performance period. the fair value of performance units granted is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the 3-year performance period. performance units vest on a pro rata basis, in certain situations, as defined by each of the plans. the fair value of each performance unit granted was estimated using a monte carlo pricing model that considers stock beta, a risk-free interest rate, expected stock volatility and expected life. the stock beta was calculated comparing the risk of the individual securities to the average risk of the companies in the index group. the risk-free interest rate reflects the yield on a u.s. treasury bond commensurate with the expected life of the performance unit. volatility over the expected term of the performance unit is calculated using daily stock price observations for ppl and all companies in the index group and is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted ppl and the companies in the index group. ppl had used historical volatility to value its performance units in 2010. beginning in 2011, ppl began using a mix of historic and implied volatility in response to the significant changes in its business model, moving from a primarily unregulated to a primarily regulated business model, as a result of the acquisitions of lke and wpd midlands. the weighted-average assumptions used in the model were: 2012 2011 2010 risk-free interest rate 0.30% 1.00% 1.41% expected stock volatility 19.30% 23.40%

options may be granted with an option exercise price per share not less than the fair value of ppl's common stock on the date of grant. options outstanding at december 31, 2012, become exercisable in equal installments over a three-year service period beginning one year after the date of grant, assuming the individual is still employed by ppl or a subsidiary. the cgnc and clc have discretion to accelerate the exercisability of the options, except that the exercisability of an option issued under the icp may not be accelerated unless the individual remains employed by ppl or a subsidiary for one year from the date of grant. all options expire no later than ten years from the grant date. the options become exercisable immediately in certain situations, as defined by each of the plans. the fair value of options granted is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. the fair value of options granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant. the fair value of each option granted is estimated using a black-scholes option-pricing model. ppl uses a risk-free interest rate, expected option life, expected volatility and dividend yield to value its stock options. the risk-free interest rate reflects the yield for a u.s. treasury strip available on the date of grant with constant rate maturity approximating the option's expected life. expected life is calculated based on historical exercise behavior. volatility over the expected term of the options is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted ppl's volatility in those prior periods. management's expectations for future volatility, considering potential changes to ppl's business model and other economic conditions, are also reviewed in addition to the historical data to determine the final volatility assumption. ppl had used historical volatility to value its stock options granted in 2010. beginning in 2011, ppl began using a mix of historic and implied volatility in response to the significant changes in its business model, moving from a primarily unregulated to a primarily regulated business model, as a result of the acquisitions of lke and wpd midlands. the dividend yield is based on several factors, including ppl's most recent dividend payment, as of the grant date and the forecasted stock price through 2013. the assumptions used in the model were: 2012 2011 2010 risk-free interest rate 1.13% 2.34% 2.52% expected option life 6.17 years 5.71 years 5.43 years expected stock volatility 20.60% 21.60% 28.57%

over 70 multiemployer pension plans, based on the bargaining units from which labor is procured. the risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects: 326 assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers . if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. if ppl energy supply's mechanical contracting subsidiaries choose to stop participating in some of their multiemployer plans, they may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the unfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. ppl energy supply identified the steamfitters local union no. 420 pension plan, ein/plan number 23-2004424/001 as the only significant plan to which contributions are made. contributions to this plan by ppl energy supply's mechanical contracting companies were $5 million for 2012, $5 million for 2011 and $4 million for 2010. at the date the financial statements were issued, the form 5500 was not available for the plan year ending in 2012. therefore, the following disclosures specific to this plan are being made based on the form 5500s filed for the plan years ended december 31, 2011 and 2010. ppl energy supply's mechanical contracting subsidiaries were not identified individually as greater than 5% contributors on the form 5500s. however, the combined contributions of the three subsidiaries contributing to the plan had exceeded 5%. the plan had a pension protection act zone status of yellow and red, without utilizing an extended amortization period, as of december 31, 2011 and 2010. in addition, the plan is subject to a rehabilitation plan and surcharges have been applied to participating employer contributions. the expiration date of the collective-bargaining agreement related to those employees participating in this plan is april 30, 2014. there were no other plans deemed individually significant based on a multifaceted assessment of each plan. this assessment included review of the funded/zone status of each plan and ppl energy supply's potential obligations under the plan and the number of participating employers contributing to the plan. ppl energy supply's mechanical contracting subsidiaries also participate in multiemployer other postretirement plans that provide for retiree life insurance and health benefits. the table below details total contributions to all multiemployer pension and other postretirement plans, including the plan identified as significant above. the contribution amounts fluctuate each year based on the volume of work and type of projects undertaken from year to year. 2012 2011 2010 pension plans $ 31 $ 36 $ 26 other postretirement medical plans 28 31 23 total contributions $ 59 $ 67 $ 49 ppl energy supply maintains a liability for the cost of health care of retired miners of former subsidiaries that had been engaged in coal mining, as required by the coal industry retiree health benefit act of 1992. at december 31, 2012, the liability was $3 million. the liability is the net of $67 million of estimated future benefit payments offset by $35 million of assets in a retired miners veba trust and an additional $29 million of excess assets available in a black lung trust that can be used to fund the health care benefits of retired miners. (ppl electric) although ppl electric does not directly sponsor any defined benefit plans, it is allocated a portion of the funded status and costs of plans sponsored by ppl services based on its participation in those plans, which management believes are reasonable. the actuarially determined obligations of current active employees are used as a basis to allocate total plan activity, including active and retiree costs and obligations. allocations to ppl electric resulted in liabilities at december 31 as follows: 2012 2011 funded status of the pension plans $ 237 $ 186 other postretirement benefits 61 53 327 (ku) although ku does not directly sponsor any defined benefit plans, it is allocated a portion of the funded status and costs of plans sponsored by lke based on its participation in those plans, which management believes are reasonable. the actuarially determined obligations of current active employees and retired employees of ku are used as a basis to allocate total plan activity, including active and retiree costs and obligations. allocations to ku resulted in liabilities at december 31 as follows. 2012 2011 funded status of the pension plans $ 104 $ 83 other postretirement benefits 53 62 plan assets - u.s. pension plans (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke and lg&amp;e) ppl's primary legacy pension plan and the pension plan in which employees of ppl montana participate are invested in the ppl services corporation master trust that also includes a 401(h) account that is restricted for certain other postretirement benefit obligations. through december 31, 2011, the plans sponsored by lke, including lg&amp;e's plan, were invested in pension trusts that also included a 401(h) account that is restricted for certain other postretirement benefit obligations. effective january 1, 2012, the assets in the lke pension trusts were transferred into the ppl services corporation master trust. the investment strategy for the master trust is to achieve a risk-adjusted return on a mix of assets that, in combination with ppl's funding policy, will ensure that sufficient assets are available to provide long-term growth and liquidity for benefit payments. the master trust benefits from a wide diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and external investment fund managers, and therefore has no significant concentration of risk. the investment policy of the ppl services corporation master trust outlines investment objectives and defines the responsibilities of the ebpb, external investment managers, investment advisor and trustee and custodian. the investment policy is reviewed annually by ppl's board of directors. the ebpb created a risk management framework around the trust assets and pension liabilities. this framework considers the trust assets as being composed of three sub-portfolios: the growth, immunizing and liquidity portfolios. the growth portfolio is comprised of investments that generate a return at a reasonable risk, including equity securities, certain debt securities and alternative investments. the immunizing portfolio consists of debt securities and derivative positions that will typically have long durations. the immunizing portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the change in the pension liabilities due to changes in interest rates. the liquidity portfolio consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents. target allocation ranges have been developed for each portfolio on a plan basis based on input from external consultants with a goal of limiting funded status volatility. the ebpb monitors the investments in each portfolio on a plan basis, and seeks to obtain a target portfolio that emphasizes reduction of risk of loss from market volatility. in pursuing that goal, the ebpb establishes revised guidelines from time to time. ebpb investment guidelines on a plan basis, as well as the weighted average of such guidelines, as of the end of 2012 are presented below. the asset allocation for the trusts and the target allocation by portfolio, at december 31, are as follows: ppl services corporation master trust 2012 target asset allocation (a) percentage of trust assets weighted 2012 (a) 2011 average ppl plans lke plans growth portfolio 58% 57% 56% 55% 59% equity securities 31% 31% debt securities (b) 18% 17% alternative investments 9% 9% immunizing portfolio 41% 41% 42% 43% 38% debt securities (b) 40% 40% derivatives 1% 1% liquidity portfolio 1% 2% 2% 2% 3% total 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 328 (a) allocations exclude consideration of cash for the wke bargaining employees' retirement plan and a guaranteed annuity contract held by the lg&amp;e and ku retirement plan.

broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments. when necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as benchmark yields, credit valuation adjustments, reference data from market research publications, monthly payment data, collateral performance and new issue data. for the ppl services corporation master trust, these securities represent investments in securities issued by u.s. treasury and u.s. government sponsored agencies; investments securitized by residential mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other pooled loans; investments in investment grade and non-investment grade bonds issued by u.s. companies across several industries; investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments and corporations; and exchange traded funds as well as commingled fund investments. investments in commingled funds include a fund that invests in a diversified portfolio of emerging market debt obligations that is measured against the jp morgan embi global diversified index, as well as funds that invest in investment grade long duration fixed income securities that are measured against the barclays long a or better index. during the first ten months of 2011 for the lg&amp;e and ku energy llc pension trusts, debt securities within commingled trusts were measured against the barclays aggregated bond index and the barclays u.s. government/credit long index. during the last two months of 2011, the debt securities for the lg&amp;e and ku energy llc pension trusts were transitioned to debt securities similar to those within the ppl services corporation master trust. the debt securities, excluding those in commingled funds, held by the ppl services corporation master trust at december 31, 2012 have a weighted-average coupon of 3.49% and a weighted-average maturity of 21 years. investments in commodities represent ownership of units of a commingled fund that is invested as a long-only, unleveraged portfolio of exchange-traded futures and forward contracts in tangible commodities to obtain broad exposure to all principal groups in the global commodity markets, including energies, agriculture and metals (both precious and industrial) using proprietary commodity trading strategies. the fund has daily liquidity with a specified notification period. the fund's fair value is based upon a unit value as calculated by the fund's trustee. investments in real estate represent an investment in a partnership whose purpose is to manage investments in core u.s. real estate properties diversified geographically and across major property types (e.g., office, industrial, retail, etc.). the manager is focused on properties with high occupancy rates with quality tenants. this results in a focus on high income and stable cash flows with appreciation being a secondary factor. core real estate generally has a lower degree of leverage when compared with more speculative real estate investing strategies. the partnership has limitations on the amounts that may be redeemed based on available cash to fund redemptions. additionally, the general partner may decline to accept redemptions when necessary to avoid adverse consequences for the partnership, including legal and tax implications, among others. the fair value of the investment is based upon a partnership unit value. 331 investments in private equity represent interests in partnerships in multiple early-stage venture capital funds and private equity fund of funds that use a number of diverse investment strategies. four of the partnerships have limited lives of ten years, while the fifth has a life of 15 years, after which liquidating distributions will be received. prior to the end of each partnership's life, the investment cannot be redeemed with the partnership; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner's approval. the ppl services corporation master trust has unfunded commitments of $73 million that may be required during the lives of the partnerships. fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed. investments in hedge funds represent investments in three hedge fund of funds. hedge funds seek a return utilizing a number of diverse investment strategies. the strategies, when combined aim to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to deliver positive returns under all market conditions. major investment strategies for the hedge fund of funds include long/short equity, market neutral, distressed debt, and relative value. generally, shares may be redeemed on 90 days prior written notice. the funds are subject to short term lockups and have limitations on the amount that may be withdrawn based on a percentage of the total net asset value of the fund, among other restrictions. all withdrawals are subject to the general partner's approval. the fair value for two of the funds has been estimated using the net asset value per share and the third fund's fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed. the fair value measurements of derivative instruments utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs. in certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models. these securities primarily represent investments in interest rate swaps and swaptions (the option to enter into an interest rate swap) which are valued based on the swap details, such as swap curves, notional amount, index and term of index, reset frequency, volatility and payer/receiver credit ratings. receivables/payables classified as level 1 represent investments sold/purchased but not yet settled. receivables/payables classified as level 2 represent interest and dividends earned but not yet received and costs incurred but not yet paid. insurance contracts, classified as level 3, represent an investment in an immediate participation guaranteed group annuity contract. the fair value is based on contract value, which represents cost plus interest income less distributions for benefit payments and administrative expenses. plan assets - u.s. other postretirement benefit plans (ppl and lke) ppl's and lke's investment strategy with respect to its other postretirement benefit obligations is to fund veba trusts and/or 401(h) accounts with voluntary contributions and to invest in a tax efficient manner. excluding the 401(h) accounts included in the ppl services corporation master trust in 2012 and lg&amp;e and ku energy llc pension trusts in 2011 discussed in plan assets - u.s. pension plans above, ppl's and lke's other postretirement benefit plans are invested in a mix of assets for long-term growth with an objective of earning returns that provide liquidity as required for benefit payments. these plans benefit from diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and investment fund managers, and therefore, have no significant concentration of risk. equity securities include investments in domestic large-cap commingled funds. ownership interests in commingled funds that invest entirely in debt securities are classified as equity securities, but treated by ppl and lke as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. ownership interests in commingled money market funds that invest entirely in money market securities are classified as equity securities, but treated by ppl and lke as cash and cash equivalents for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. the asset allocation for the veba trusts and the target allocation, by asset class, at december 31 are detailed below. target asset percentage of plan assets allocation 2012 2011 2012 asset class u.s. equity securities 46% 41% 45% debt securities (a) 51% 53% 50% cash and cash equivalents (b) 3% 6% 5% total 100% 100% 100% (a) includes commingled debt funds and debt securities.

(ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric) employee stock ownership plan certain ppl subsidiaries sponsor a non-leveraged esop in which domestic employees, excluding those of ppl montana, lke and the mechanical contractors, are enrolled on the first day of the month following eligible employee status. dividends paid on esop shares are treated as ordinary dividends by ppl. under existing income tax laws, ppl is permitted to deduct the amount of those dividends for income tax purposes and to contribute the resulting tax savings (dividend-based contribution) to the esop. the dividend-based contribution is used to buy shares of ppl's common stock and is expressly conditioned upon the deductibility of the contribution for federal income tax purposes. contributions to the esop are allocated to eligible participants' accounts as of the end of each year, based 75% on shares held in existing participants' accounts and 25% on the eligible participants' compensation. compensation expense for esop contributions was $8 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010. these amounts were offset by the dividend-based contribution tax savings and had no impact on ppl's earnings. ppl shares within the esop outstanding at december 31, 2012 were 7,857,222, or 1% of total common shares outstanding, and are included in all eps calculations. separation benefits certain ppl subsidiaries provide separation benefits to eligible employees. these benefits may be provided in the case of separations due to performance issues, loss of job related qualifications or organizational changes. until december 1, 2012, certain employees separated were eligible for cash severance payments, outplacement services, accelerated stock award vesting, continuation of group health and welfare coverage, and enhanced pension and postretirement medical benefits. as of december 1, 2012, separation benefits for certain employees were changed to eliminate accelerated stock award vesting and enhanced pension and postretirement medical benefits. also, the continuation of group health and welfare coverage was replaced with a single sum payment approximating the dollar amount of premium payments that would be incurred for continuation of group health and welfare coverage. separation benefits are recorded when such amounts are probable and estimable. separation benefits were not significant in 2012 and 2010. see note 10 for separation benefits recorded in 2011 in connection with a reorganization following the acquisition of wpd midlands. (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric and lke) health care reform in march 2010, health care reform was signed into law. many provisions of health care reform do not take effect for an extended period of time, and most will require the publication of implementing regulations and/or issuance of program guidelines. 337 beginning in 2013, provisions within health care reform eliminate the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received by plan sponsors that provide retiree prescription drug benefits equivalent to medicare part d coverage. as a result, in 2010: ppl recorded income tax expense of $8 million; and ppl energy supply recorded income tax expense of $5 million. other provisions within health care reform that apply to ppl and its subsidiaries include: an excise tax, beginning in 2018, imposed on high-cost plans providing health coverage that exceeds certain thresholds; a requirement to extend dependent coverage up to age 26; and broadening the eligibility requirements under the federal black lung act. ppl and its subsidiaries have evaluated the provisions of health care reform and have included the applicable provision in the valuation of those benefit plans that are impacted. the inclusion of the various provisions of health care reform did not have a material impact on the financial statements. ppl and its subsidiaries will continue to monitor the potential impact of any changes to the existing provisions and implementation guidance related to health care reform on their benefit programs. 14. jointly owned facilities (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) at december 31, 2012 and 2011, the balance sheets reflect the owned interests in the facilities listed below. construction ownership other accumulated work interest electric plant property depreciation in progress ppl december 31, 2012 generating plants susquehanna 90.00% $ 4,628 $ 3,530 $ 65 conemaugh 16.25% 238 122 30 keystone 12.34% 206 82 3 trimble county units 1 &amp;

(ppl energy supply) see note 16 for information on the power supply agreements between ppl energyplus and ppl electric. ppl montana hydroelectric license commitments (ppl and ppl energy supply) ppl montana owns and operates 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir licensed by the ferc under long-term licenses pursuant to the federal power act. pursuant to section 8(e) of the federal power act, the ferc approved the transfer from montana power to ppl montana of all pertinent licenses in connection with the montana asset purchase agreement. the kerr dam project license (50-year term) was issued by the ferc jointly to montana power and the confederated salish and kootenai tribes of the flathead nation in 1985, and requires ppl montana (as successor licensee to montana power) to hold and operate the project for at least 30 years (to 2015). between 2015 and 2025, the tribes have the option to purchase, hold and operate the project for the remainder of the license term, which expires in 2035. while the tribes have indicated their intent to exercise the option at the earliest possible date, ppl montana cannot predict if and when this option will be exercised. the license also requires ppl montana to continue to implement a plan to mitigate the impact of the kerr dam on fish, wildlife and their habitats. under this arrangement, ppl montana has a remaining commitment to spend $6 million between 2013 and 2015, in addition to the annual rent it pays to the tribes. ppl montana entered into two memoranda of understanding (mous) with state, federal and private entities related to the issuance in 2000 of the ferc renewal license for the nine dams comprising the missouri-madison project. the mous are periodically updated and renewed and require ppl montana to implement plans to mitigate the impact of its projects on fish, wildlife and their habitats, and to increase recreational opportunities. the mous were created to maximize collaboration between the parties and enhance the possibility to receive matching funds from relevant federal agencies. under these arrangements, ppl montana has a remaining commitment to spend $30 million between 2013 and 2040. 341 legal matters (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl and its subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. ppl and its subsidiaries cannot predict the outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material liabilities, unless otherwise noted. wke indemnification (ppl and lke) see footnote (l) to the table in "guarantees and other assurances" below for information on an lke indemnity relating to its former wke lease, including related legal proceedings. (ppl and ppl energy supply) montana hydroelectric litigation in november 2004, ppl montana, avista corporation (avista) and pacificorp commenced an action for declaratory judgment in montana first judicial district court seeking a determination that no lease payments or other compensation for their hydroelectric facilities' use and occupancy of certain riverbeds in montana can be collected by the state of montana. this lawsuit followed dismissal on jurisdictional grounds of an earlier federal lawsuit seeking such compensation in the u.s. district court of montana. the federal lawsuit alleged that the beds of montana's navigable rivers became state-owned trust property upon montana's admission to statehood, and that the use of them should, under a 1931 regulatory scheme enacted after all but one of the hydroelectric facilities in question were constructed, trigger lease payments for use of land beneath. in july 2006, the montana state court approved a stipulation by the state of montana that it was not seeking compensation for the period prior to ppl montana's december 1999 acquisition of the hydroelectric facilities. following a number of adverse trial court rulings, in 2007 pacificorp and avista each entered into settlement agreements with the state of montana providing, in pertinent part, that each company would make prospective lease payments for use of the state's navigable riverbeds (subject to certain future adjustments), resolving the state's claims for past and future compensation. following an october 2007 trial of this matter on damages, in june 2008, the montana district court awarded the state retroactive compensation of approximately $35 million for the 2000-2006 period and approximately $6 million for 2007 compensation. those unpaid amounts accrue interest at 10% per year. the montana district court also deferred determination of compensation for 2008 and future years to the montana state land board. in october 2008, ppl montana appealed the decision to the montana supreme court, requesting a stay of judgment and a stay of the land board's authority to assess compensation for 2008 and future periods. in march 2010, the montana supreme court substantially affirmed the june 2008 montana district court decision. as a result, in the first quarter of 2010, ppl montana recorded a pre-tax charge of $56 million ($34 million after tax), representing estimated rental compensation for the first quarter of 2010 and prior years, including interest. rental compensation was estimated for periods subsequent to 2007. the portion of the pre-tax charge that related to prior years totaled $54 million ($32 million after tax). the pre-tax charge recorded on the statement of income was $49 million in "other operation and maintenance" and $7 million in "interest expense." in august 2010, ppl montana filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the u.s. supreme court requesting review of this matter. in june 2011, the u.s. supreme court granted ppl montana's petition, and in february 2012 issued a decision overturning the montana supreme court decision and remanded the case to the montana supreme court for further proceedings consistent with the u.s. supreme court's opinion. as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2011 ppl montana reversed its total loss accrual of $89 million ($53 million after-tax) which had been recorded prior to the u.s. supreme court decision. the amount reversed was recorded on the statement of income as a $75 million credit to "other operation and maintenance" and a $14 million credit to "interest expense." ppl montana believes the u.s. supreme court decision resolves certain questions of liability in this case in favor of ppl montana and leaves open for reconsideration by montana courts, consistent with the findings of the u.s. supreme court, certain other questions. in april 2012, the case was returned by the montana supreme court to the montana first judicial district court. further proceedings have not yet been scheduled by the district court. ppl montana has concluded it is no longer probable, but it remains reasonably possible, that a loss has been incurred. while unable to estimate a range of loss, ppl montana believes that any such amount would not be material. 342 bankruptcy of smgt in october 2011, smgt, a montana cooperative and purchaser of electricity under a long-term supply contract with ppl energyplus expiring in june 2019 (smgt contract), filed for protection under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code in the u.s. bankruptcy court for the district of montana. at the time of the bankruptcy filing, smgt was ppl energyplus' largest unsecured credit exposure. this contract was accounted for as npns by ppl energyplus. the smgt contract provided for fixed volume purchases on a monthly basis at established prices. pursuant to a court order and subsequent stipulations entered into between the smgt bankruptcy trustee and ppl energyplus, since the date of its chapter 11 filing through january 2012, smgt continued to purchase electricity from ppl energyplus at the price specified in the smgt contract and made timely payments for such purchases, but at lower volumes than as prescribed in the smgt contract. in january 2012, the trustee notified ppl energyplus that smgt would not purchase electricity under the smgt contract for the month of february. in march 2012, the u.s. bankruptcy court for the district of montana issued an order approving the request of the smgt trustee and ppl energyplus to terminate the smgt contract. as a result, the smgt contract was terminated effective april 1, 2012, allowing ppl energyplus to resell to other customers the electricity previously contracted to smgt. ppl energyplus' receivable under the smgt contract, representing non-performance by smgt prior to termination of the smgt contract, totaled approximately $21 million at december 31, 2012, which has been fully reserved. in july 2012, ppl energyplus filed its proof of claim in the smgt bankruptcy proceeding. the total claim, including the above receivable, is approximately $375 million, predominantly an unsecured claim representing the value for energy sales that will not occur as a result of the termination of the smgt contract. no assurance can be given as to the collectability of the claim, thus no amounts have been recorded in the 2012 financial statements. ppl energy supply cannot predict any amount that it may recover in connection with the smgt bankruptcy or the prices and other terms on which it will be able to market to third parties the power that smgt will not purchase from ppl energyplus due to the termination of the smgt contract. notices of intent to sue colstrip owners in july 2012, ppl montana received a notice of intent to sue for violations of the clean air act at colstrip steam electric station (notice) from counsel on behalf of the sierra club and the meic. an amended notice was received on september 4, 2012, and a second amended notice was received in october 2012. a supplemental notice was received in december 2012. the notice, amended notice, second amended notice, and supplemental notice (the notices) were all addressed to the owner or managing agent of colstrip, and to the other colstrip co-owners: avista corporation, puget sound energy, portland general electric company, northwestern energy and pacificorp. the notice alleges certain violations of the clean air act, including new source review, title v and opacity requirements. the amended notice alleges additional opacity violations at colstrip, and the second amended notice alleges additional title v violations. the supplemental notice includes additional new source review claims. all four notices state that sierra club and meic will request a united states district court to impose injunctive relief and civil penalties, require a beneficial environmental project in the areas affected by the alleged air pollution and require reimbursement of sierra club's and meic's costs of litigation and attorney's fees. under the clean air act, lawsuits cannot be filed until 60 days after the applicable notice date. ppl is evaluating the allegations set forth in the notices and cannot at this time predict the outcome of this matter. regulatory issues (ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) see note 6 for information on regulatory matters related to utility rate regulation. enactment of financial reform legislation (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the dodd-frank act became effective in july 2010 and includes provisions that impose derivative transaction reporting requirements and require most over-the-counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange and to be centrally cleared. the dodd-frank act also provides that the u.s. commodity futures trading commission (cftc) may impose collateral and margin requirements for over-the-counter derivative transactions, as well as capital requirements for certain entity classifications. final rules on major provisions in the dodd-frank act are being established through rulemakings. the rulemakings are scheduled to become effective at different times beginning with the october 12, 2012 effective date of the definitional rule for the term "swap". in particular, the cftc's final rule (final rule), defining key terms such as "swap dealer" and "major swap participant", took effect with the effectiveness of the swap definitional rule. 343 the heightened thresholds and requirements for these entity classifications set forth in the final rule resulted in the registrants currently being designated neither swap dealers nor major swap participants. the dodd-frank act and its implementing regulations, however, will impose on the registrants significant additional and costly recordkeeping and reporting requirements. also, the registrants could face significantly higher operating costs or may be required to post additional collateral if they or their counterparties are subject to capital or margin requirements as ultimately adopted in the implementing regulations of the dodd-frank act. the registrants will continue to evaluate the provisions of the dodd-frank act and its implementing regulations. at this time, the registrants cannot predict the impact that the law or its implementing regulations will have on their businesses or operations, or the markets in which they transact business, but could incur significant costs related to compliance with the dodd-frank act. (ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric) new jersey capacity legislation in january 2011, new jersey enacted a law that intervenes in the wholesale capacity market exclusively regulated by the ferc: s. no. 2381, 214th leg. (n.j. 2011) (the act). to create incentives for the development of new, in-state electric generation facilities, the act implements a "long-term capacity agreement pilot program (lcapp)." the act requires new jersey utilities to pay a guaranteed fixed price for wholesale capacity, imposed by the new jersey board of public utilities (bpu), to certain new generators participating in pjm, with the ultimate costs of that guarantee to be borne by new jersey ratepayers. ppl believes the intent and effect of the lcapp is to encourage the construction of new generation in new jersey even when, under the ferc-approved pjm economic model, such new generation would not be economic. the act could depress capacity prices in pjm in the short term, impacting ppl energy supply's revenues, and harm the long-term ability of the pjm capacity market to incent necessary generation investment throughout pjm. in february 2011, the pjm power providers group (p3), an organization in which ppl is a member, filed a complaint before the ferc seeking changes in pjm's capacity market rules designed to ensure that subsidized generation, such as the generation that may result from the implementation of the lcapp, will not be able to set capacity prices artificially low as a result of their exercise of buyer market power. in april 2011, the ferc issued an order granting in part and denying in part p3's complaint and ordering changes in pjm's capacity rules consistent with a significant portion of p3's requested changes. several parties have filed appeals of the ferc's order. ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or the economic impact on their businesses or operations, or the markets in which they transact business. in addition, in february 2011, ppl, and several other generating companies and utilities filed a complaint in u.s. district court in new jersey challenging the act on the grounds that it violates well-established principles under the supremacy clause and the commerce clause of the u.s. constitution. in this action, the plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief barring implementation of the act by the commissioners of the bpu. in october 2011, the court denied the bpu's motion to dismiss the proceeding. in september 2012, the u.s. district court denied all summary judgment motions, and the litigation is continuing. trial is scheduled to begin in march 2013. ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or the economic impact on their businesses or operations, or the markets in which they transact business. maryland capacity order in april 2012, the maryland public service commission (md psc) ordered three electric utilities in maryland to enter into long-term contracts to support the construction of new electric generating facilities in maryland, specifically a 661 mw natural gas-fired combined-cycle generating facility to be owned by cpv maryland, llc. ppl believes the intent and effect of the action by the md psc is to encourage the construction of new generation in maryland even when, under the ferc-approved pjm economic model, such new generation would not be economic. the md psc action could depress capacity prices in pjm in the short term, impacting ppl energy supply's revenues, and harm the long-term ability of the pjm capacity market to encourage necessary generation investment throughout pjm. in april 2012, ppl and several other generating companies filed a complaint in u.s. district court in maryland challenging the md psc order on the grounds that it violates well-established principles under the supremacy and commerce clauses of the u.s. constitution. in this action, the plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief barring implementation of the order by the commissioners of the md psc. in august 2012, the court denied the md psc and cpv maryland, llc motions to dismiss the proceeding and the litigation is continuing. trial is scheduled to begin in march 2013. ppl, ppl energy supply, and ppl electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or the economic impact on their businesses or operations, or the markets in which they transact business. 344 pacific northwest markets (ppl and ppl energy supply) through its subsidiaries, ppl energy supply made spot market bilateral sales of power in the pacific northwest during the period from december 2000 through june 2001. several parties subsequently claimed refunds at ferc as a result of these sales. in june 2003, the ferc terminated proceedings to consider whether to order refunds for spot market bilateral sales made in the pacific northwest, including sales made by ppl montana, during the period december 2000 through june 2001. in august 2007, the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the ferc's decision and ordered the ferc to consider additional evidence. in october 2011, ferc initiated proceedings to consider additional evidence. at june 30, 2012, there were two remaining claims against ppl energy supply totaling $73 million. in july 2012, ppl montana and the city of tacoma, one of the parties claiming refunds at ferc, reached a settlement whereby ppl montana would pay $75 thousand to resolve the city of tacoma's $23 million claim, $9 million of which represents interest. the settlement does not resolve the remaining claim outstanding at december 31, 2012 of approximately $50 million. although ppl and its subsidiaries believe they have not engaged in any improper trading or marketing practices affecting the pacific northwest markets, ppl and ppl energy supply cannot predict the outcome of the above-described proceedings or whether any subsidiaries will be the subject of any additional governmental investigations or named in other lawsuits or refund proceedings. consequently, ppl and ppl energy supply cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to this matter. (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ferc market-based rate authority in 1998, the ferc authorized lg&amp;e, ku and ppl energyplus to make wholesale sales of electric power and related products at market-based rates. in those orders, the ferc directed lg&amp;e, ku and ppl energyplus, respectively, to file an updated market analysis within three years after the order, and every three years thereafter. since then, periodic market-based rate filings with the ferc have been made by lg&amp;e, ku, ppl energyplus, ppl electric, ppl montana and most of ppl generation's subsidiaries. these filings consisted of a northwest market-based rate filing for ppl montana and a northeast market-based rate filing for most of the other ppl subsidiaries in pjm's region. in june 2011, ferc approved ppl's market-based rate update for the eastern and western regions. also, in june 2011, ppl filed its market-based rate update for the southeast region, including lg&amp;e and ku in addition to ppl energyplus. in june 2011, the ferc issued an order approving lg&amp;e's and ku's request for a determination that they no longer be deemed to have market power in the brec balancing area and removing restrictions on their market-based rate authority in such region. currently, a seller granted ferc market-based rate authority may enter into power contracts during an authorized time period. if the ferc determines that the market is not workably competitive or that the seller possesses market power or is not charging "just and reasonable" rates, it may institute prospective action, but any contracts entered into pursuant to the ferc's market-based rate authority remain in effect and are generally subject to a high standard of review before the ferc can order changes. recent court decisions by the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit have raised issues that may make it more difficult for the ferc to continue its program of promoting wholesale electricity competition through market-based rate authority. these court decisions permit retroactive refunds and a lower standard of review by the ferc for changing power contracts, and could have the effect of requiring the ferc in advance to review most, if not all, power contracts. in june 2008, the u.s. supreme court reversed one of the decisions of the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit, thereby upholding the higher standard of review for modifying contracts. at this time, ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku cannot predict the impact of these court decisions on the ferc's future market-based rate authority program or on their businesses. electric reliability standards the nerc is responsible for establishing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards (reliability standards) regarding the bulk power system. the ferc oversees this process and independently enforces the reliability standards. the reliability standards have the force and effect of law and apply to certain users of the bulk power electricity system, including electric utility companies, generators and marketers. under the federal power act, the ferc may assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day, per violation, for certain violations. lg&amp;e, ku , ppl electric and certain subsidiaries of ppl energy supply monitor their compliance with the reliability standards and continue to self-report potential violations of certain applicable reliability requirements and submit accompanying mitigation plans, as required. the resolution of a number of potential violations is pending. any regional reliability entity (including rfc or serc) determination concerning the resolution of violations of the reliability standards remains subject to the approval of the nerc and the ferc. 345 in the course of implementing their programs to ensure compliance with the reliability standards by those ppl affiliates subject to the standards, certain other instances of potential non-compliance may be identified from time to time. the registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, other than the amounts currently recorded. in october 2012, the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (nopr) concerning reliability standards for geomagnetic disturbances. the ferc proposes to direct nerc to submit for approval reliability standards that address the impact of geomagnetic disturbances on the reliable operation of the bulk-power system, including one or more measures to protect against damage to the bulk-power system, such as the installation of equipment that blocks geomagnetically induced currents on implicated transformers. if the nopr is adopted by the ferc, it is expected to require the registrants either or both to make significant expenditures in new equipment or modifications to their facilities. the registrants are unable to predict whether the nopr will be adopted as proposed by the ferc or the amount of any expenditures that may be required as a result of the adoption of any reliability standards for geomagnetic disturbances. settled litigation (ppl and ppl energy supply) spent nuclear fuel litigation in may 2011, ppl susquehanna entered into a settlement agreement with the u.s. government relating to ppl susquehanna's lawsuit, seeking damages for the department of energy's failure to accept spent nuclear fuel from the ppl susquehanna plant. ppl susquehanna recorded credits totaling $56 million to "fuel" on the statement of income in 2011 to recognize recovery, under the settlement agreement, of certain costs to store spent nuclear fuel at the susquehanna plant. the amounts recorded through september 2011 cover costs incurred from 1998 through december 2010. ppl susquehanna is eligible to receive payment of annual claims for allowed costs, as set forth in the settlement agreement, that are incurred through december 31, 2013. in exchange, ppl susquehanna has waived any claims against the united states government for costs paid or injuries sustained related to storing spent nuclear fuel at the susquehanna plan through december 31, 2013. environmental matters - domestic (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) due to the environmental issues discussed below or other environmental matters, it may be necessary for the registrants to modify, curtail, replace or cease operating certain facilities or operations to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts. in addition, legal challenges to new environmental permits or rules add to the uncertainty of estimating the future cost impact of these permits and rules. lg&amp;e and ku are entitled to recover, through the ecr mechanism, certain costs of complying with the clean air act as amended and those federal, state, or local environmental requirements which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from facilities utilized for production of energy from coal in accordance with their approved compliance plans. costs not covered by the ecr for lg&amp;e and ku and all such costs for ppl electric are subject to rate recovery before their respective state regulatory authorities, or the ferc, if applicable. because ppl electric does not own any generating plants, its exposure to environmental compliance costs is reduced. as ppl energy supply is not a rate regulated entity, it does not have any mechanism for seeking rate recovery of environmental compliance costs. ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities. (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) air csapr (formerly clean air transport rule) and cair in july 2011, the epa adopted the csapr, which was intended to finalize and rename the clean air transport rule (transport rule) proposed in august 2010. the csapr replaced the epa's previous cair which was invalidated by the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit (the court) in july 2008. cair subsequently was effectively reinstated by the court in december 2008, pending finalization of the transport rule. like cair, csapr only applied to ppl's fossil-fueled generating plants located in kentucky and pennsylvania. 346 in december 2011, the court stayed implementation of the csapr and left cair in effect pending a final decision on the validity of the rule. in august 2012, the court issued a ruling invalidating csapr, remanding the rule to the epa for further action, and leaving cair in place during the interim. a further revised rule is not expected from the epa for at least two years. the csapr was meant to facilitate attainment of ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulates by requiring reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions. the csapr established new sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowance cap and trade programs that were more restrictive than previously under cair. the csapr provided for two-phased programs of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions reductions, with initial reductions in 2012 and more stringent reductions in 2014. the kentucky fossil-fueled generating plants can meet the cair sulfur dioxide emission requirements by utilizing sulfur dioxide allowances (including banked allowances). to meet nitrogen oxide standards, under the cair, the kentucky companies will need to buy allowances and/or make operational changes. lg&amp;e and ku do not currently anticipate that the costs of meeting these reinstated cair requirements or standards will be significant. ppl energy supply's pennsylvania fossil-fueled generating plants can meet the cair sulfur dioxide emission requirements with the existing scrubbers that were placed in service in 2008 and 2009. to meet nitrogen oxide standards, under the cair, ppl energy supply will need to buy allowances and/or make operational changes, the costs of which are not anticipated to be significant. national ambient air quality standards in addition to the reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions required under the cair for its pennsylvania and kentucky plants, ppl's fossil-fueled generating plants, including those in montana, may face further reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions as a result of more stringent national ambient air quality standards for ozone, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and/or fine particulates. in 2010, the epa finalized a new one-hour standard for sulfur dioxide, and states are required to identify areas that meet those standards and areas that are in non-attainment. for non-attainment areas, states are required to develop plans by 2014 to achieve attainment by 2017. for areas that are in attainment or that are unclassifiable, states are required to develop maintenance plans by mid-2013 that demonstrate continued attainment. in december 2012, the epa issued final rules that strengthen the particulate standards. under the final rule, states and the epa have until the end of 2014 to identify initial non-attainment areas, and states have until 2020 to achieve attainment status for those areas. states can request an extension to 2025 to comply with the rule. until particulate matter and sulfur dioxide maintenance and compliance plans are developed, ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku cannot predict which of their facilities may be located in a non-attainment area and what measures would be required to achieve attainment status. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku anticipate that some of the measures required for compliance with the cair, the mats, or the regional haze requirements, such as upgraded or new sulfur dioxide scrubbers at some of their plants and, in the case of lg&amp;e and ku, the previously announced retirement of coal-fired generating units at the cane run, green river and tyrone plants, will help to achieve compliance with the new one-hour sulfur dioxide standard. if additional reductions were to be required, the financial impact could be significant. mercury and other hazardous air pollutants in may 2011, the epa published a proposed regulation providing for stringent reductions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. in february 2012, the epa published the final rule, known as the mats, with an effective date of april 16, 2012. the rule is being challenged by industry groups and states. the epa issued a proposed rule in november 2012 reconsidering limited aspects of its mats and new source performance standards (nsps) to which ppl responded with comments. the rule provides for a three-year compliance deadline with the potential for a one-year extension as provided under the statute. based on their assessment of the need to install pollution control equipment to meet the provisions of the proposed rule, lg&amp;e and ku filed requests with the kpsc for environmental cost recovery to facilitate moving forward with plans to install environmental controls including chemical additive and fabric-filter baghouses to remove certain hazardous air pollutants. recovery of the cost of certain controls was granted by the kpsc in december 2011. see note 6 for information on lg&amp;e's and ku's anticipated retirement of certain coal-fired electric generating units in response to this and other environmental regulations. with the publication of the final mats rule, lg&amp;e and ku are currently assessing whether any revisions of their approved compliance plans will be necessary. 347 with respect to ppl energy supply's pennsylvania plants, ppl energy supply believes that certain coal-fired plants may require installation of chemical additive systems, the cost of which is not expected to be significant. with respect to ppl energy supply's montana plants, modifications to the current air pollution controls installed on colstrip may be required, the cost of which is not expected to be significant. for the corette plant, ppl energy supply announced in september 2012 its intention, beginning in april 2015, to place the plant in long-term reserve status, suspending the plant's operation due to expected market conditions and the costs to comply with the mats requirements. the corette plant asset group's carrying amount at december 31, 2012 was approximately $68 million. although the corette plant asset group was not determined to be impaired at december 31, 2012, it is reasonably possible that an impairment could occur in future periods as higher priced sales contracts settle, adversely impacting projected cash flows. ppl energy supply, lg&amp;e and ku are continuing to conduct in-depth reviews of the mats, including the potential implications to scrubber wastewater discharges. see the discussion of effluent limitations guidelines and standards below. regional haze and visibility in january 2012, the epa proposed limited approval of the pennsylvania regional haze state implementation plan (pa sip). that proposal would essentially approve ppl's analysis that further particulate controls at ppl energy supply's pennsylvania plants are not warranted. the limited approval does not address deficiencies of the state plan arising from the remand of the cair. previously, the epa had determined that implementation of the cair requirements would meet regional haze requirements. in 2012, the epa finalized a rule providing that implementation of the csapr would also meet the best available retrofit technology (bart) requirements for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. this rule also addresses the pa sip deficiency arising from the cair remand. however, in august 2012, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit (court) vacated and remanded the csapr back to the epa for further rulemaking (as discussed above). in september 2012, several environmental groups filed a petition for review with the court challenging the epa's approval of the pa sip. at this time, it is not known whether the epa will reinstate its previous determination that cair satisfies the bart requirement or will require states to conduct source-specific bart studies. in montana, the epa region 8 developed the regional haze plan as the montana department of environmental quality declined to develop a bart state implementation plan at this time. ppl submitted to the epa its analyses of the visibility impacts of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate emissions for colstrip units 1 and 2 and corette. ppl's analyses concluded that further reductions are not warranted, except that the epa concurred with the installation of separated overfire air (sofa) and lime injection for units 1 and 2. ppl has also submitted data and analyses of various air emission control options under the rules to reduce air emissions related to the non-bart-affected emission sources of colstrip units 3 and 4. the analyses show that any incremental reductions would not be cost-effective and that further analysis is not warranted. in september 2012, the epa issued its final federal implementation plans (fip) for the montana regional haze rule. the final fip indicated that no additional controls were required for corette or colstrip units 3 and 4 but proposed tighter limits for corette and colstrip units 1 and 2. ppl energy supply expects to meet these tighter permit limits at corette without any significant changes to operations, although other requirements have led to the planned suspension of operations at corette beginning in april 2015. see "mercury and other hazardous air pollutants" discussion above. under the final fip, colstrip units 1 and 2 will require additional controls, including the possible installation of an sncr and other technology, to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide limits. the cost of these potential additional controls, if required, could be significant. in november 2012, ppl filed a petition for review of the montana regional haze fip with the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit. environmental groups have also filed a petition for review. the two matters have been consolidated, and the parties have agreed to a briefing schedule. lg&amp;e and ku also submitted analyses of the visibility impacts of their kentucky bart-eligible sources to the kentucky division for air quality (kdaq). only lg&amp;e's mill creek plant was determined to have a significant regional haze impact. the kdaq has submitted a regional haze sip to the epa which requires the mill creek plant to reduce its sulfuric acid mist emissions from units 3 and 4, the costs of which are not expected to be significant. after approval of the kentucky sip by the epa and revision of the mill creek plant's air permit under title v, lg&amp;e intends to install sorbent injection controls at the plant to reduce sulfuric acid mist emissions. new source review (nsr) the epa has continued its nsr enforcement efforts targeting coal-fired generating plants. the epa has asserted that modification of these plants has increased their emissions and, consequently, that they are subject to stringent nsr requirements under the clean air act. in april 2009, ppl received epa information requests for its montour and brunner island plants. the requests are similar to those that ppl received in the early 2000s for its colstrip, corette and martins creek plants. ppl and the epa have exchanged certain information regarding this matter. in january 2009, ppl and other 348 companies that own or operate the keystone plant in pennsylvania received a notice of violation from the epa alleging that certain projects were undertaken without proper nsr compliance. in may and november 2012, ppl montana received information requests from the epa regarding projects undertaken during the spring 2012 maintenance outage at colstrip unit 1. in september 2012, ppl montana received an information request from the montana department of environmental quality regarding the unit 1 and other projects. ppl and ppl energy supply cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. in addition, in august 2007, lg&amp;e received information requests for the mill creek and trimble county plants, and ku received requests for the ghent plant, but they have received no further communications from the epa since providing their responses. ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. in march 2009, ku received a notice alleging that ku violated certain provisions of the clean air act's rules governing nsr and prevention of significant deterioration by installing sulfur dioxide scrubbers and scr controls at its ghent plant without assessing potential increased sulfuric acid mist emissions. ku contends that the work in question, as pollution control projects, was exempt from the requirements cited by the epa. in december 2009, the epa issued an information request on this matter. in september 2012, the parties reached a tentative settlement addressing the ghent nsr matter and a september 2007 notice of violation alleging opacity violations at the plant. a consent decree was lodged in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of kentucky in december 2012. ppl, lke and ku cannot predict the outcome of this matter until the consent decree is entered by the court, but currently do not expect such outcome to result in costs in excess of amounts already accrued, which amounts are not material. if ppl subsidiaries are found to have violated nsr regulations, ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku would, among other things, be required to meet permit limits reflecting best available control technology (bact) for the emissions of any pollutant found to have significantly increased due to a major plant modification. the costs to meet such limits, including installation of technology at certain units, could be significant. states and environmental groups also have provided notice of their intention to initiate enforcement actions and litigation alleging violations of the nsr regulations by coal-fired generating plants. see "legal matters" above for information on a notice of intent to sue received in july 2012 (and amended multiple times thereafter) by ppl montana and other owners of colstrip. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku are unable to predict whether such actions will be brought against any of their other plants. colstrip and corette air permits (ppl and ppl energy supply) in january 2013, earthjustice, on behalf of the sierra club and the meic filed an administrative appeal with the board of environmental review, setting forth challenges to certain components of the title v permits for colstrip and corette. these challenges include: 1) the regional haze requirements should have been included in the title v permits for corette and colstrip; 2) the mats requirements should have been included in the title v permits for corette and colstrip; 3) the particulate monitoring methodology is inadequate at corette and colstrip; and 4) sulfur dioxide monitoring is inadequate at corette. ppl montana intends to participate in this proceeding and cannot predict its outcome. on january 31, 2013, the sierra club and the meic alleged identical claims in their joint petition to the epa, requesting that the epa object to the mdeq's issuance of colstrip's and corette's title v permits. ppl montana cannot predict the outcome of this parallel matter pending before the epa. tc2 air permit (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the sierra club and other environmental groups petitioned the kentucky environmental and public protection cabinet to overturn the air permit issued for the tc2 baseload generating unit, but the agency upheld the permit in an order issued in september 2007. in response to subsequent petitions by environmental groups, the epa ordered certain non-material changes to the permit which were incorporated into a final revised permit issued by the kdaq in january 2010. in march 2010, the environmental groups petitioned the epa to object to the revised state permit. until the epa issues a final ruling on the pending petition and all available appeals are exhausted, ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact on the capital costs of this project, if any. 349 (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) global climate change there is concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and the possible contribution of ghg emissions including, most significantly, carbon dioxide, from the combustion of fossil fuels. this has resulted in increased demands for carbon dioxide emission reductions from investors, environmental organizations, government agencies and the international community. these demands and concerns have led to federal legislative proposals, actions at regional, state and local levels, litigation relating to ghg emissions and the epa regulations on ghgs. greenhouse gas legislation while climate change legislation was actively considered in 2009-2010, such legislation has not significantly progressed. since that time, although the u.s. house of representatives passed legislation attempting to bar the epa from regulating ghg emissions under the existing authority of the clean air act, the senate never took up the legislation. the timing and elements of future federal legislation addressing ghg emission reductions are uncertain at this time. greenhouse gas regulations and tort litigation as a result of the april 2007 u.s. supreme court decision that the epa has authority under the clean air act to regulate ghg emissions from new motor vehicles, in april 2010, the epa and the u.s. department of transportation issued new light-duty vehicle emissions standards that apply beginning with 2012 model year vehicles. the epa also clarified that this standard, beginning in 2011, authorized regulation of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the nsr and title v operating permit provisions of the clean air act. as a result, any new sources or major modifications to existing ghg sources causing a net significant emissions increase requires the bact permit limits for ghgs. the rules were challenged, and in june 2012, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit upheld the epa's regulations. in december 2012, the court denied petitions for rehearing pertaining to the court's june 2012 opinion. in addition, in april 2012, the epa proposed nsps for carbon dioxide emissions from new coal-fired generating units, combined-cycle natural gas units, and integrated gasification combined-cycle units. the proposal would require new coal plants to achieve the same stringent limitations on carbon dioxide emissions as the best performing new gas plants. there presently is no commercially available technology to allow new coal plants to achieve these limitations and, as a result, the epa's proposal would effectively preclude future construction of new coal-fired generation. in december 2012, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dismissed consolidated challenges to the nsps holding that the proposed rule is not a final agency action. the epa is expected to finalize the nsps for new sources in early 2013. at the regional level, ten northeastern states signed a memorandum of understanding (mou) agreeing to establish a ghg emission cap-and-trade program, called the regional greenhouse gas initiative (rggi). the program commenced in january 2009 and calls for stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions, at base levels established in 2005, from electric power plants with capacity greater than 25 mw. the mou also provides for a 10% reduction, by 2019, in carbon dioxide emissions from base levels. pennsylvania has not stated an intention to join the rggi, but enacted the pennsylvania climate change act of 2008 (pcca). the pcca established a climate change advisory committee to advise the padep on the development of a climate change action plan. in december 2009, the advisory committee finalized its climate change action report and identified specific actions that could result in reducing ghg emissions by 30% by 2020. some of the proposed actions, such as a mandatory 5% efficiency improvement at power plants, could be technically unachievable. to date, there have been no regulatory or legislative actions taken to implement the recommendations of the report. in addition, legislation has been introduced that would, if enacted, accelerate solar supply requirements and restrict eligible solar projects to those located in pennsylvania. ppl and ppl energy supply cannot predict at this time whether this legislation will be enacted. eleven western states and certain canadian provinces established the western climate initiative (wci) in 2003. the wci established a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 15% below 2005 levels by 2020 and developed ghg emission allocations, offsets, and reporting recommendations. montana was once a partner in the wci, but by 2011 withdrew, along with several other western states. 350 in november 2008, the governor of kentucky issued a comprehensive energy plan including non-binding targets aimed at promoting improved energy efficiency, development of alternative energy, development of carbon capture and sequestration projects, and other actions to reduce ghg emissions. in december 2009, the kentucky climate action plan council was established to develop an action plan addressing potential ghg reductions and related measures. to date, the state has not issued a final plan. the impact of any such plan is not now determinable, but the costs to comply with the plan could be significant. a number of lawsuits have been filed asserting common law claims including nuisance, trespass and negligence against various companies with ghg emitting plants, and the law remains unsettled on these claims. in september 2009, the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit in the case of aep v. connecticut reversed a federal district court's decision and ruled that several states and public interest groups, as well as the city of new york, could sue five electric utility companies under federal common law for allegedly causing a public nuisance as a result of their emissions of ghgs. in june 2011, the u.s. supreme court overturned the lower court and held that such federal common law claims were displaced by the clean air act and regulatory actions of the epa. in addition, in comer v. murphy oil (comer case), the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit (fifth circuit) declined to overturn a district court ruling that plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue state common law claims against companies that emit ghgs. the complaint in the comer case named the previous indirect parent of lke as a defendant based upon emissions from the kentucky plants. in january 2011, the supreme court denied a petition to reverse the fifth circuit's ruling. in may 2011, the plaintiffs in the comer case filed a substantially similar complaint in federal district court in mississippi against 87 companies, including ku and three other indirect subsidiaries of lke, under a mississippi statute that allows the re-filing of an action in certain circumstances. in march 2012, the mississippi federal court granted defendants' motions to dismiss the state common law claims because plaintiffs had previously raised the same claims, plaintiffs lacked standing, plaintiffs' claims were displaced by the clean air act, and other grounds. in april 2012, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the fifth circuit. additional litigation in federal and state courts over these issues is continuing. ppl, lke and ku cannot predict the outcome of this litigation or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. in 2012, ppl's power plants emitted approximately 70 million tons of carbon dioxide compared with 74 million tons in 2011. the totals reflect 35 million tons from ppl generation and 35 million tons from lg&amp;e's and ku's generating fleet. all tons are u.s. short tons (2,000 pounds/ton). renewable energy legislation (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) there has been interest in renewable energy legislation at both the state and federal levels. federal legislation on renewable energy is not expected to be introduced this year. in pennsylvania, bills were recently introduced in both the senate and house amending the existing aeps to accelerate the current solar generation obligation, but no action was taken before the end of the 2011-2012 legislative session. future bills are expected calling for an increase in aeps tier 1 (renewable resources, such as wind and solar) obligations and to create a $25 million permanent funding program for solar. bills have also been introduced in montana to add hydropower as a qualified source to the renewable portfolio standard. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku believe there are financial, regulatory and logistical uncertainties related to the implementation of renewable energy mandates that will need to be resolved before the impact of such requirements on them can be estimated. such uncertainties, among others, include the need to provide back-up supply to augment intermittent renewable generation, potential generation over-supply that could result from such renewable generation and back-up, impacts to pjm's capacity market and the need for substantial changes to transmission and distribution systems to accommodate renewable energy sources. these uncertainties are not directly addressed by proposed legislation. ppl and ppl energy supply cannot predict at this time the effect on their merchant plants' future competitive position, results of operation, cash flows and financial position of renewable energy mandates that may be adopted, although the costs to implement and comply with any such requirements could be significant. water/waste coal combustion residuals (ccrs) (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) in june 2010, the epa proposed two approaches to regulating the disposal and management of ccrs (as either hazardous or non-hazardous) under the resource conservation and recovery act (rcra). ccrs include fly ash, bottom ash and sulfur dioxide scrubber wastes. the first approach would regulate ccrs as a hazardous waste under subtitle c of the rcra. this approach would materially increase costs and result in early retirements of many coal-fired plants, as it would require plants to retrofit their operations to comply with full hazardous waste requirements for the generation of ccrs and associated waste waters through generation, transportation and disposal. this would also have a negative impact on the beneficial use of ccrs and could eliminate existing markets for ccrs. the second approach would regulate ccrs as a solid (non-hazardous) waste under subtitle d of the rcra. this approach would mainly affect disposal and most significantly affect any wet 351 disposal operations. under this approach, many of the current markets for beneficial uses would not be affected. currently, ppl expects that several of its plants in kentucky and montana could be significantly impacted by the requirements of subtitle d of the rcra, as these plants are using surface impoundments for management and disposal of ccrs. the epa has issued information requests on ccr management practices at numerous plants throughout the power industry as it considers whether or not to regulate ccrs as hazardous waste. ppl has provided information on ccr management practices at most of its plants in response to the epa's requests. in addition, the epa has conducted follow-up inspections to evaluate the structural stability of ccr management facilities at several ppl plants and ppl has implemented certain actions in response to recommendations from these inspections. the epa is continuing to evaluate the unprecedented number of comments it received on its june 2010 proposed regulations. in october 2011, the epa issued a notice of data availability (noda) that requests comments on selected documents that the epa received during the comment period for the proposed regulations. in addition, the u.s. house of representatives in september 2012 approved a bill that was revised in the senate to modify subtitle d of the rcra to provide for the proper management and disposal of ccrs and to preclude the epa from regulating ccrs under subtitle c of the rcra. this revised bill is being considered in the senate and the prospect for passage is uncertain. in january 2012, a coalition of environmental groups filed a 60-day notice of intent to sue the epa for failure to perform nondiscretionary duties under rcra, which could require a deadline for the epa to issue strict ccr regulations. in february 2012, two ccr recycling companies also issued a 60-day notice of intent to sue the epa over its timeliness in issuing ccr regulations, but they requested that the epa take a subtitle d approach that would allow for continued recycling of ccrs. the coalition filed its lawsuit in april 2012 and litigation is continuing. a final rulemaking is currently expected before the end of 2015. however, the timing of the final regulations could be accelerated by the outcome of the above litigation, which could require the epa to issue its regulations sooner. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku cannot predict at this time the final requirements of the epa's ccr regulations or potential changes to the rcra and what impact they would have on their facilities, but the financial impact could be material if regulated as a hazardous waste under subtitle c and significant if regulated under subtitle d. martins creek fly ash release (ppl and ppl energy supply) in 2005, approximately 100 million gallons of water containing fly ash was released from a disposal basin at the martins creek plant used in connection with the operation of the plant's two 150 mw coal-fired generating units. this resulted in ash being deposited onto adjacent roadways and fields, and into a nearby creek and the delaware river. ppl determined that the release was caused by a failure in the disposal basin's discharge structure. ppl conducted extensive clean-up and completed studies, in conjunction with a group of natural resource trustees and the delaware river basin commission, evaluating the effects of the release on the river's sediment, water quality and ecosystem. the padep filed a complaint in pennsylvania commonwealth court against ppl martins creek and ppl generation, alleging violations of various state laws and regulations and seeking penalties and injunctive relief. ppl and the padep have settled this matter. the settlement also required ppl to submit a report on the completed studies of possible natural resource damages. ppl subsequently submitted the assessment report to the pennsylvania and new jersey regulatory agencies and has continued discussing potential natural resource damages and mitigation options with the agencies. subsequently, in august 2011 the padep submitted its national resource damage assessment report to the court and to the interveners. in december 2011, the interveners commented on the padep report and in february 2012 the padep and ppl filed separate responses with the court. in march 2012, the court dismissed the interveners' case, but the interveners have appealed the dismissal to the pennsylvania supreme court and a decision by the court is still pending. through december 31, 2012, ppl energy supply has spent $28 million for remediation and related costs and an insignificant remediation liability remains on the balance sheet. ppl and ppl energy supply cannot be certain of the outcome of the natural resource damage assessment or the associated costs, the outcome of any lawsuit that may be brought by citizens or businesses or the nature of any other regulatory or legal actions that may be initiated against ppl, ppl energy supply or their subsidiaries as a result of the disposal basin release. however, ppl and ppl energy supply currently do not expect such outcomes to result in significant losses above the amounts currently recorded. 352 seepages and groundwater infiltration - pennsylvania, montana and kentucky (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) seepages or groundwater infiltration have been detected at active and retired wastewater basins and landfills at various ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku plants. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku have completed or are completing assessments of seepages or groundwater infiltration at various facilities and have completed or are working with agencies to implement abatement measures, where required. a range of reasonably possible losses cannot currently be estimated. (ppl and ppl energy supply) in 2007, six plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the montana sixteenth judicial district court against the colstrip plant owners asserting property damage due to seepage from plant wastewater ponds. a settlement agreement was reached in july 2010 which would have resulted in a payment by ppl montana, but certain of the plaintiffs later argued the settlement was not final. the colstrip plant owners filed a motion to enforce the settlement and in october 2011 the court granted the motion and ordered the settlement to be completed in 60 days. the plaintiffs appealed the october 2011 order to the montana supreme court, which affirmed the district court's order enforcing the settlement on december 31, 2012 and denied plaintiff's motion for rehearing on february 5, 2013. the parties have 60 days after the february 5, 2013 decision to complete the settlement. ppl montana's share of the settlement is not expected to be significant. in august 2012, ppl montana entered into an administrative order on consent (aoc) with the mdeq which establishes a comprehensive process to investigate and remediate groundwater seepage impacts related to the wastewater facilities at the colstrip power plant. the aoc requires that within five years, ppl montana provide financial assurance to the mdeq for the costs associated with closure and future monitoring of the waste-water treatment facilities. ppl montana cannot predict at this time if the actions required under the aoc will create the need to adjust the existing aro related to these facilities. in september 2012, earthjustice filed an affidavit pursuant to montana's major facility siting act (mfsa) that sought review of the aoc by montana's board of environmental review (ber), on behalf of the sierra club, the meic, and the national wildlife federation (nwf). in september 2012, ppl montana filed an election with the ber to have this proceeding conducted in montana state district court as contemplated by the mfsa. in october 2012, earthjustice filed a petition for review of the aoc in the montana state district court in rosebud county. in late october 2012, earthjustice filed a second complaint against the mdeq and ppl montana in state district court in lewis and clark county on behalf of the sierra club, the meic and the nwf. this complaint alleges that the defendants have failed to take action under the mfsa and the montana water quality act to effectively monitor and correct issues of coal ash disposal and wastewater ponds at the colstrip plant. the complaint seeks a declaration that the operations of the impoundments violate the statutes addressed above, requests a writ of mandamus directing the mdeq to enforce the same, and seeks recovery of attorneys' fees and costs. ppl is vigorously defending these allegations, and ppl and ppl energy supply cannot predict the outcome of this matter. clean water act 316(b) (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the epa finalized requirements in 2004 for new or modified cooling water intake structures. these requirements affect where generating plants are built, establish intake design standards and could lead to requirements for cooling towers at new and modified power plants. in 2009, however, the u.s. supreme court ruled that the epa has discretion to use cost-benefit analysis in determining the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact to aquatic organisms. the epa published the proposed rule on new or modified cooling water intake structures in april 2011. the industry and ppl reviewed the proposed rule and submitted comments. the epa has been evaluating comments and meeting with industry groups to discuss options. two nodas have been issued on the rule that indicate the epa may be willing to amend the rule based on certain industry group comments, and the epa's comment period on the nodas has ended. the final rule is expected to be issued in 2013. the proposed rule contains two requirements to reduce impact to aquatic organisms. the first requires all existing facilities to meet standards for the reduction of mortality of aquatic organisms that become trapped against water intake screens regardless of the levels of mortality actually occurring or the cost of achieving the requirements. the second requirement is to determine and install the best technology available to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms that are pulled through the plant's cooling water system. a form of cost-benefit analysis is allowed for this second requirement. this process involves a site-specific evaluation based on nine factors, including impacts to energy delivery reliability and the remaining useful life of the plant. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku cannot reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible costs, if any, until a final rule is issued, the required studies have been completed, and each state in which they operate has decided how to implement the rule. 353 effluent limitations guidelines and standards (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) in october 2009, the epa released its final detailed study of the steam electric power generating effluent limitations guidelines and standards. the epa is expected to issue the final regulations in 2014. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku expect the revised guidelines and standards to be more stringent than the current standards especially for sulfur dioxide scrubber wastewater. the guidelines are also expected to require dry ash handling, which could result in additional costs for technology retrofits for closure of wet basins. in the interim, states may impose more stringent limits on a case-by-case basis under existing authority as permits are renewed. under the clean water act, permits are subject to renewal every five years. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate a range of reasonably possible costs, but the costs could be significant. other issues (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) in 2006, the epa significantly decreased to 10 parts per billion (ppb) the drinking water standards for arsenic. in pennsylvania, montana and kentucky, this arsenic standard has been incorporated into the states' water quality standards and could result in more stringent limits in npdes permits for ppl's pennsylvania, montana and kentucky plants. subsequently, the epa developed a draft risk assessment for arsenic that increases the cancer risk exposure by more than 20, which would lower the current standard from 10 ppb to 0.1 ppb. if the lower standard becomes effective, costly treatment would be required to attempt to meet the standard and, at this time, there is no assurance that it could be achieved. ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku cannot predict the outcome of the draft risk assessment and what impact, if any, it would have on their plants, but the costs could be significant. the epa is reassessing its polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcb) regulations under the toxics substance control act, which currently allow certain pcb articles to remain in use. in april 2010, the epa issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking for changes to these regulations. this rulemaking could lead to a phase-out of all pcb-containing equipment. the epa is planning to propose the revised regulations in late 2013. pcbs are found, in varying degrees, in all of the registrants' operations. the registrants cannot predict at this time the outcome of these proposed epa regulations and what impact, if any, they would have on their facilities, but the costs could be significant. a ppl energy supply subsidiary signed a consent order and agreement (coa) with the padep in july 2008 under which it agreed, under certain conditions, to take further actions to minimize the possibility of fish kills at its brunner island plant. fish are attracted to warm water in the power plant discharge channel, especially during cold weather. debris at intake pumps can result in a unit trip or reduction in load, causing a sudden change in water temperature and fish mortality. a barrier has been constructed to prevent debris from entering the river water intake area at a cost that was not significant. ppl energy supply's subsidiary has also investigated alternatives to exclude fish from the discharge channel, but the subsidiary and the padep have concluded that a barrier method to exclude fish is not workable. in june 2012, a new coa was signed that allows the subsidiary to study a change in a cooling tower operational method that may keep fish from entering the channel. should this approach fail, the new coa requires a retrofit of impingement control technology at the intakes to the cooling towers, the cost of which could be significant. in may 2010, the subsidiary received a draft npdes permit (renewed) for the brunner island plant from the padep. this permit includes new water quality-based limits for the scrubber wastewater plant. some of these limits may not be achievable with the existing treatment system. several agencies and environmental groups commented on the draft permit, raising issues that must be resolved to obtain a final permit for the plant. ppl energy supply cannot predict the outcome of the final resolution of the permit issues at this time, or what impact, if any, they would have on this facility, but the costs could be significant. in may 2010, the kentucky waterways alliance and other environmental groups filed a petition with the kentucky energy and environment cabinet challenging the kentucky pollutant discharge elimination system permit issued in april 2010, which covers water discharges from the trimble county plant. in november 2010, the cabinet issued a final order upholding the permit. in december 2010, the environmental groups appealed the order to the trimble circuit court, but the case was subsequently transferred to the franklin circuit court. ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. the epa and the army corps of engineers are working on a guidance document that will expand the federal government's interpretation of what constitutes "waters of the united states" subject to regulation under the clean water act. this change has the potential to affect generation and delivery operations, with the most significant effect being the potential elimination of the existing regulatory exemption for plant waste water treatment systems. the costs that may be imposed on the 354 registrants as a result of any eventual expansion of this interpretation cannot reliably be estimated at this time but could be significant. superfund and other remediation (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl electric is potentially responsible for costs at several sites listed by the epa under the federal superfund program, including the columbia gas plant site, the metal bank site and the ward transformer site. clean-up actions have been or are being undertaken at all of these sites, the costs of which have not been significant to ppl electric. however, should the epa require different or additional measures in the future, or should ppl electric's share of costs at multi-party sites increase substantially more than currently expected, the costs could be significant. ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku are remediating or have completed the remediation of several sites that were not addressed under a regulatory program such as superfund, but for which ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku may be liable for remediation. these include a number of former coal gas manufacturing plants in pennsylvania and kentucky previously owned or operated or currently owned by predecessors or affiliates of ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku. there are additional sites, formerly owned or operated by ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku predecessors or affiliates, for which ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku lack information on current site conditions and are therefore unable to predict what, if any, potential liability they may have. depending on the outcome of investigations at sites where investigations have not begun or been completed or developments at sites for which ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku currently lack information, the costs of remediation and other liabilities could be material. ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these matters. the epa is evaluating the risks associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene, chemical by-products of coal gas manufacturing. as a result of the epa's evaluation, individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil cleanup. this could require several ppl subsidiaries to take more extensive assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas manufacturing plants. ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these matters. under the pennsylvania clean streams law, subsidiaries of ppl generation are obligated to remediate acid mine drainage at former mine sites and may be required to take additional steps to prevent potential acid mine drainage at previously capped refuse piles. one ppl generation subsidiary is pumping mine water at two mine sites and treating water at one of these sites. another ppl generation subsidiary has installed a passive wetlands treatment system at a third site. at december 31, 2012, ppl energy supply had accrued a discounted liability of $26 million to cover the costs of pumping and treating groundwater at the two mine sites for 50 years and for operating and maintaining passive wetlands treatment at the third site. ppl energy supply discounted this liability based on risk-free rates at the time of the mine closures. the weighted-average rate used was 8.19%. expected undiscounted payments are estimated at $3 million for 2013, $1 million for each of the years from 2014 through 2017, and $139 million for work after 2017. from time to time, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku undertake remedial action in response to spills or other releases at various on-site and off-site locations, negotiate with the epa and state and local agencies regarding actions necessary for compliance with applicable requirements, negotiate with property owners and other third parties alleging impacts from ppl's operations and undertake similar actions necessary to resolve environmental matters which arise in the course of normal operations. based on analyses to date, resolution of these environmental matters is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on their operations. future cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at sites not currently identified, may result in significant additional costs for the registrants. environmental matters - wpd (ppl) wpd's distribution businesses are subject to environmental regulatory and statutory requirements. ppl believes that wpd has taken and continues to take measures to comply with the applicable laws and governmental regulations for the protection of the environment. the u.k. government has requested that utilities undertake projects to alleviate the impact of flooding on the u.k. utility infrastructure, including major electricity substations. wpd has agreed with the ofgem to spend $45 million on flood prevention, which will be recovered through rates during the ten-year period commencing april 2010. wpd is currently liaising on site-specific proposals with local offices of a u.k. government agency. 355 there are no other material legal or administrative proceedings pending against or related to wpd with respect to environmental matters. other nuclear insurance (ppl and ppl energy supply) ppl susquehanna is a member of certain insurance programs that provide coverage for property damage to members' nuclear generating plants. facilities at the susquehanna plant are insured against property damage losses up to $2.75 billion under these programs. ppl susquehanna is also a member of an insurance program that provides insurance coverage for the cost of replacement power during prolonged outages of nuclear units caused by certain specified conditions. under the property and replacement power insurance programs, ppl susquehanna could be assessed retroactive premiums in the event of the insurers' adverse loss experience. at december 31, 2012, this maximum assessment was $48 million. in the event of a nuclear incident at the susquehanna plant, ppl susquehanna's public liability for claims resulting from such incident would be limited to $12.6 billion under provisions of the price-anderson act as amended. ppl susquehanna is protected against this liability by a combination of commercial insurance and an industry assessment program. in the event of a nuclear incident at any of the reactors covered by the price-anderson act as amended, ppl susquehanna could be assessed up to $235 million per incident, payable at $35 million per year. guarantees and other assurances (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) in the normal course of business, the registrants enter into agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. such agreements include, for example, guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and surety bonds issued by insurance companies. these agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities in which these subsidiaries engage. (ppl) ppl fully and unconditionally guarantees all of the debt securities of ppl capital funding. (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the table below details guarantees provided as of december 31, 2012. the total recorded liability at december 31, 2012 and 2011 was $24 million and $14 million for ppl and $20 million and $11 million for lke. the probability of expected payment/performance under each of these guarantees is remote except for "wpd guarantee of pension and other obligations of unconsolidated entities" and "indemnification of lease termination and other divestitures." for reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, all guarantees of ppl energy supply (other than the letters of credit), ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku also apply to ppl, and all guarantees of lg&amp;e and ku also apply to lke. exposure at expiration december 31, 2012 (a) date ppl indemnifications related to the wpd midlands acquisition (b) wpd indemnifications for entities in liquidation and sales of assets $ 11 (c) 2015 wpd guarantee of pension and other obligations of unconsolidated entities 91 (d) 2015 ppl energy supply letters of credit issued on behalf of affiliates 23 (e) 2013 - 2014 retrospective premiums under nuclear insurance programs 48 (f) nuclear claims assessment under the price-anderson act amendments under the energy policy act of 2005 235 (g) indemnifications for sales of assets 250 (h) 2025 indemnification to operators of jointly owned facilities 6 (i) guarantee of a portion of a divested unconsolidated entity's debt 22 (j) 2018 356 exposure at expiration december 31, 2012 (a) date ppl electric guarantee of inventory value 21 (k) 2016 lke indemnification of lease termination and other divestitures 301 (l) 2021 - 2023 lg&amp;e and ku lg&amp;e and ku guarantee of shortfall related to ovec (m) (a) represents the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required to be made under the guarantee. (b) prior to ppl's acquisition, wpd midlands holdings limited had agreed to indemnify certain former directors of a turkish entity in which wpd midlands holdings limited previously owned an interest, for any liabilities that may arise as a result of an investigation by turkish tax authorities, and ppl wem has received a cross-indemnity from e.on ag with respect to these indemnification obligations. additionally, ppl subsidiaries agreed to provide indemnifications to subsidiaries of e.on ag for certain liabilities relating to properties and assets owned by affiliates of e.on ag that were transferred to wpd midlands in connection with the acquisition. the maximum exposure and expiration of these indemnifications cannot be estimated because the maximum potential liability is not capped and the expiration date is not specified in the transaction documents. (c) in connection with the liquidation of wholly owned subsidiaries that have been deconsolidated upon turning the entities over to the liquidators, certain affiliates of ppl global have agreed to indemnify the liquidators, directors and/or the entities themselves for any liabilities or expenses arising during the liquidation process, including liabilities and expenses of the entities placed into liquidation. in some cases, the indemnifications are limited to a maximum amount that is based on distributions made from the subsidiary to its parent either prior or subsequent to being placed into liquidation. in other cases, the maximum amount of the indemnifications is not explicitly stated in the agreements. the indemnifications generally expire two to seven years subsequent to the date of dissolution of the entities. the exposure noted only includes those cases in which the agreements provide for a specific limit on the amount of the indemnification, and the expiration date was based on an estimate of the dissolution date of the entities. in connection with their sales of various businesses, wpd and its affiliates have provided the purchasers with indemnifications that are standard for such transactions, including indemnifications for certain pre-existing liabilities and environmental and tax matters. in addition, in connection with certain of these sales, wpd and its affiliates have agreed to continue their obligations under existing third-party guarantees, either for a set period of time following the transactions or upon the condition that the purchasers make reasonable efforts to terminate the guarantees. finally, wpd and its affiliates remain secondarily responsible for lease payments under certain leases that they have assigned to third parties. (d) as a result of the privatization of the utility industry in the u.k., certain electric associations' roles and responsibilities were discontinued or modified. as a result, certain obligations, primarily pension-related, associated with these organizations have been guaranteed by the participating members. costs are allocated to the members based on predetermined percentages as outlined in specific agreements. however, if a member becomes insolvent, costs can be reallocated to and are guaranteed by the remaining members. at december 31, 2012, wpd has recorded an estimated discounted liability based on its current allocated percentage of the total expected costs for which the expected payment/performance is probable. neither the expiration date nor the maximum amount of potential payments for certain obligations is explicitly stated in the related agreements. therefore, they have been estimated based on the types of obligations. (e) standby letter of credit arrangements under ppl energy supply's credit facilities for the purposes of protecting various third parties against nonperformance by ppl. this is not a guarantee by ppl on a consolidated basis. (f) ppl susquehanna is contingently obligated to pay this amount related to potential retrospective premiums that could be assessed under its nuclear insurance programs. see "nuclear insurance" above for additional information. (g) this is the maximum amount ppl susquehanna could be assessed for each incident at any of the nuclear reactors covered by this act. see "nuclear insurance" above for additional information. (h) ppl energy supply's maximum exposure with respect to certain indemnifications and the expiration of the indemnifications cannot be estimated because, in the case of certain indemnification provisions, the maximum potential liability is not capped by the transaction documents and the expiration date is based on the applicable statute of limitation. the exposure and expiration dates noted are only for those cases in which the agreements provide for specific limits. the indemnification provisions described below are in each case subject to certain customary limitations, including thresholds for allowable claims, caps on aggregate liability, and time limitations for claims arising out of breaches of most representations and warranties. a subsidiary of ppl energy supply has agreed to provide indemnification to the purchaser of the long island generation business for damages arising out of any breach of the representations, warranties and covenants under the related transaction agreement and for damages arising out of certain other matters, including liabilities relating to certain renewable energy facilities which were previously owned by one of the ppl subsidiaries sold in the transaction but which were unrelated to the long island generation business. the indemnification provisions for most representations and warranties expired in the third quarter of 2011. a subsidiary of ppl energy supply has agreed to provide indemnification to the purchasers of the maine hydroelectric facilities for damages arising out of any breach of the representations, warranties and covenants under the respective transaction agreements and for damages arising out of certain other matters, including liabilities of the ppl energy supply subsidiary relating to the pre-closing ownership or operation of those hydroelectric facilities. the indemnification provisions for most representations and warranties expired in the fourth quarter of 2012. subsidiaries of ppl energy supply have agreed to provide indemnification to the purchasers of certain non-core generation facilities sold in march 2011 for damages arising out of any breach of the representations, warranties and covenants under the related transaction agreements and for damages arising out of certain other matters relating to the facilities that were the subject of the transaction, including certain reduced capacity payments (if any) at one of the facilities in the event specified pjm rule changes are proposed and become effective. the indemnification provisions for most representations and warranties expired in the first quarter of 2012. (i) in december 2007, a subsidiary of ppl energy supply executed revised owners agreements for two jointly owned facilities, the keystone and conemaugh generating plants. the agreements require that in the event of any default by an owner, the other owners fund contributions for the operation of the generating plants, based upon their ownership percentages. the non-defaulting owners, who make up the defaulting owner's obligations, are entitled to the generation entitlement of the defaulting owner, based upon their ownership percentage. the exposure shown reflects the ppl energy supply subsidiary's share of the maximum obligation. the agreements do not have an expiration date. 357 (j) a ppl energy supply subsidiary owned a one-third equity interest in safe harbor water power corporation (safe harbor) that was sold in march 2011. beginning in 2008, ppl energy supply guaranteed one-third of any amounts payable with respect to certain senior notes issued by safe harbor. under the terms of the sale agreement, ppl energy supply continues to guarantee the portion of safe harbor's debt, but received a cross-indemnity from the purchaser, secured by a lien on the purchaser's stock of safe harbor, in the event ppl energy supply is required to make a payment under the guarantee. the exposure noted reflects principal only. see note 9 for additional information on the sale of this interest. (k) ppl electric entered into a contract with a third party logistics firm that provides inventory procurement and fulfillment services. under the contract, the logistics firm has title to the inventory purchased for ppl electric's use. upon termination of the contract, ppl electric has guaranteed to purchase any remaining inventory that has not been used or sold by the logistics firm at the weighted-average cost at which the logistics firm purchased the inventory, thus protecting the logistics firm from reductions in the fair value of the inventory. (l) lke provides certain indemnifications, the most significant of which relate to the termination of the wke lease in july 2009. see note 9 for additional information. these guarantees cover the due and punctual payment, performance and discharge by each party of its respective present and future obligations. the most comprehensive of these guarantees is the lke guarantee covering operational, regulatory and environmental commitments and indemnifications made by wke under the wke transaction termination agreement. this guarantee has a term of 12 years ending july 2021, and a cumulative maximum exposure of $200 million. certain items such as government fines and penalties fall outside the cumulative cap. lke has contested the applicability of the indemnification requirement relating to one matter presented by a counterparty under this guarantee. another guarantee with a maximum exposure of $100 million covering other indemnifications expires in 2023. in may 2012, lke's indemnitee received an arbitration panel's decision affecting this matter, which granted lke's indemnitee certain rights of first refusal to purchase excess power at a market-based price rather than at an absolute fixed price. in january 2013, lke's indemnitee commenced a proceeding in the kentucky court of appeals appealing a december 2012 order of the henderson circuit court confirming the arbitration award. lke believes its indemnification obligations in this matter remain subject to various uncertainties, including the potential for additional legal challenges regarding the arbitration decision as well as future prices, availability and demand for the subject excess power. lke continues to evaluate various legal and commercial options with respect to this indemnification matter. the ultimate outcomes of the wke termination-related indemnifications cannot be predicted at this time. additionally, lke has indemnified various third parties related to historical obligations for other divested subsidiaries and affiliates. the indemnifications vary by entity and the maximum exposures range from being capped at the sale price to no specified maximum; however, lke is not aware of formal claims under such indemnities made by any party at this time. lke could be required to perform on these indemnifications in the event of covered losses or liabilities being claimed by an indemnified party. in the second quarter of 2012, lke adjusted its estimated liability for certain of these indemnifications by $9 million ($5 million after-tax), which is reflected in "income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes)" on the statement of income. the adjustment was recorded in the kentucky regulated segment for ppl. lke cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of such indemnification circumstances, but does not currently expect such outcomes to result in significant losses above the amounts recorded. (m) as described in the "energy purchase commitments" above, pursuant to the ovec power purchase contract, expiring in june 2040, lg&amp;e and ku are obligated to pay a demand charge which includes, among other charges, debt service and amortization toward principal retirement, decommissioning costs, post-retirement and post-employment benefits costs (other than pensions), and reimbursement of plant operating, maintenance and other expenses. the demand charge is expected to cover lg&amp;e's and ku's shares of the cost of the listed items over the term of the contract. however, in the event there is a shortfall in covering these costs, lg&amp;e and ku are obligated to pay their share of the excess debt service, post-retirement and decommissioning costs. the maximum exposure and the expiration date of these potential obligations are not presently determinable. the registrants provide other miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course of business. these guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnification or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in duration. the amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated. historically, no significant payments have been made with respect to these types of guarantees and the probability of payment/performance under these guarantees is remote. ppl, on behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage. the coverage requires a maximum $4 million deductible per occurrence and provides maximum aggregate coverage of $200 million. this insurance may be applicable to obligations under certain of these contractual arrangements. 16. related party transactions (ppl energy supply and ppl electric) plr contracts/purchase of accounts receivable ppl electric holds competitive solicitations for plr generating supply. ppl energyplus has been awarded a portion of the plr generation supply through these competitive solicitations. see note 15 for additional information on the solicitations. the sales and purchases between ppl energyplus and ppl electric are included in the statements of income as "wholesale energy marketing to affiliate" by ppl energy supply and as "energy purchases from affiliate" by ppl electric. under the standard supply master agreement for the solicitation process, ppl electric requires all suppliers to post collateral once credit exposures exceed defined credit limits. ppl energyplus is required to post collateral with ppl electric: (a) when the market price of electricity to be delivered by ppl energyplus exceeds the contract price for the forecasted quantity of electricity to be delivered and (b) this market price exposure exceeds a contractual credit limit. based on the current credit rating of ppl energy supply, as guarantor, ppl energyplus' credit limit was $35 million at december 31, 2012. in no instance is ppl electric required to post collateral to suppliers under these supply contracts. ppl electric's customers may choose an alternative supplier for their generation supply. see note 1 for additional information regarding ppl electric's purchases of accounts receivable from alternative suppliers, including ppl energyplus. 358 at december 31, 2012, ppl energy supply had a net credit exposure of $27 million to ppl electric from its commitment as a plr supplier and from the sale of its accounts receivable to ppl electric. wholesale sales and purchases (lg&amp;e and ku) lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail native load. when lg&amp;e has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail native load and its generation cost is lower than that of ku, ku purchases electricity from lg&amp;e. when ku has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail native load and its generation cost is lower than that of lg&amp;e, lg&amp;e purchases electricity from ku. these transactions are reflected in the statements of income as "electric revenue from affiliate" and "energy purchases from affiliate" and are recorded at a price equal to the seller's fuel cost. savings realized from such intercompany transactions are shared equally between both companies. the volume of energy each company has to sell to the other is dependent on its native load needs and its available generation. allocations of ppl services costs (ppl energy supply, ppl electric and lke) ppl services provides corporate functions such as financial, legal, human resources and information technology services. ppl services charges the respective ppl subsidiaries for the cost of such services when they can be specifically identified. the cost of the services that is not directly charged to ppl subsidiaries is allocated to applicable subsidiaries based on an average of the subsidiaries' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees. ppl services charged the following amounts for the years ended december 31, which ppl management believes are reasonable, including amounts applied to accounts that are further distributed between capital and expense. 2012 2011 2010 ppl energy supply $ 212 $ 189 $ 232 ppl electric 157 145 134 lke 15 16 3 (a) (a) represents costs allocated during the two months ended december 31, 2010 as lke was acquired november 1, 2010. intercompany billings by lks (lg&amp;e and ku) lks provides lg&amp;e and ku with a variety of centralized administrative, management and support services. the cost of these services is directly charged to the company or, for general costs that cannot be directly attributed, charged based on predetermined allocation factors, including the following measures: number of customers, total assets, revenues, number of employees and/or other statistical information. lks charged the amounts in the table below, which lke management believes are reasonable, including amounts that are further distributed between capital and expense. successor predecessor two months ten months year ended year ended ended ended december 31, december 31, december 31, october 31, 2012 2011 2010 2010 lg&amp;e $ 186 $ 190 $ 32 $ 200 ku 161 204 34 222 in addition, lg&amp;e and ku provide services to each other and to lks. billings between lg&amp;e and ku relate to labor and overheads associated with union and hourly employees performing work for the other company, charges related to jointly-owned generating units and other miscellaneous charges. tax settlements between lke and lg&amp;e and ku are reimbursed through lks. intercompany borrowings (ppl energy supply) a ppl energy supply subsidiary periodically holds revolving lines of credit and demand notes from certain affiliates that are reflected in "note receivable from affiliates" on the balance sheet. at december 31, 2012, there were no outstanding balances. at december 31, 2011, a note with ppl energy funding had an outstanding balance of $198 million with an interest rate of 3.77%. interest earned on these revolving facilities is included in "interest income from affiliates" on the statements of income. for 2012, interest earned on borrowings was insignificant. for 2011, interest earned on borrowings, 359 which was substantially attributable to borrowings by ppl energy funding as discussed above, was $8 million. for 2010, interest earned on borrowings, excluding the term notes discussed below, was $5 million with interest rates equal to one-month libor plus a spread. (ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) in november 2010, a ppl energy supply subsidiary held term notes with lg&amp;e and ku. these notes were subsequently repaid and therefore no balances were outstanding at december 31, 2010. interest on these notes was included in "interest income from affiliates" for ppl energy supply and "interest expense with affiliate" for lke, lg&amp;e and ku. when balances were outstanding, interest on these notes was insignificant for 2010. (lke) lke maintains a $300 million revolving line of credit with a ppl energy funding subsidiary whereby lke can borrow funds on a short-term basis at market-based rates. the interest rates on borrowings are equal to one-month libor plus a spread. at december 31, 2012, $25 million was outstanding and was reflected in "notes payable with affiliates" on the balance sheet. the interest rate on the outstanding borrowing at december 31, 2012 was 1.71%. the line of credit was held by another ppl subsidiary in 2011. no balance was outstanding at december 31, 2011. interest on the revolving line of credit was not significant for 2012 or 2011. lke maintains an agreement with a ppl affiliate that has a $300 million borrowing limit whereby lke can loan funds on a short-term basis at market-based rates. at december 31, 2012, there was no outstanding balance. at december 31, 2011, $15 million was outstanding and was reflected in "notes receivable from affiliates" on the balance sheet. the interest rates on loans are based on the ppl affiliate's credit rating and are currently equal to one-month libor plus a spread. the interest rate on the outstanding borrowing at december 31, 2011 was 2.27%. interest income on this note was not significant in 2012 or 2011. (lg&amp;e) lg&amp;e participates in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby lke and/or ku make available to lg&amp;e funds up to $500 million at an interest rate based on a market index of commercial paper issues. at december 31, 2012 and 2011, there was no balance outstanding. interest expense incurred and interest income earned on the money pool agreement with lke and/or ku was not significant for 2012, 2011 or 2010. (ku) ku participates in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby lke and/or lg&amp;e make available to ku funds up to $500 million at an interest rate based on a market index of commercial paper issues. at december 31, 2012 and 2011, there was no balance outstanding. interest expense incurred and interest income earned on the money pool agreement with lke and/or lg&amp;e was not significant for 2012, 2011 or 2010. intercompany derivatives (lke, lg&amp;e and ku) in november 2012, lg&amp;e and ku entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with ppl for notional amounts of $150 million each. these hedging instruments have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by ppl with third parties. see note 19 for additional information on intercompany derivatives. (ppl energy supply) trademark royalties a ppl subsidiary owns ppl trademarks and billed certain affiliates for their use under a licensing agreement. this agreement was terminated in december 2011. ppl energy supply was charged $40 million of license fees in 2011 and 2010. these charges are primarily included in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income. 360 distribution of interest in ppl global to parent in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its membership interest in ppl global to its parent, ppl energy funding. see note 9 for additional information. intercompany insurance (ppl electric) ppl power insurance ltd. (ppl power insurance) is a subsidiary of ppl that provides insurance coverage to ppl and its subsidiaries for property damage, general/public liability and workers' compensation. due to damages resulting from several puc-reportable storms that occurred in 2012 and 2011, ppl electric exceeded its deductible for both policy years. probable recoveries on insurance claims with ppl power insurance of $18.25 million for 2012 and $26.5 million for 2011 were recorded in those years, of which $14 million and $16 million were included in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income. in both years, the remainder was recorded in pp&amp;e on the balance sheets. in september 2012, ppl electric received $26.5 million from the settlement of its 2011 claims. effective january 1, 2013, ppl electric no longer has storm insurance with ppl power insurance. other (ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) see note 1 for discussions regarding the intercompany tax sharing agreement and note 7 for a discussion regarding capital transactions by ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku. for ppl energy supply, ppl electric and lke, refer to note 1 for discussions regarding intercompany allocations of stock-based compensation expense. for ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku, see note 13 for discussions regarding intercompany allocations associated with defined benefits. 17. o ther income (expense) - net (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the breakdown of "other income (expense) - net" for the years ended december 31 was: ppl 2012 2011 2010 other income earnings on securities in ndt funds $ 22 $ 24 $ 20 interest income 5 7 8 afudc - equity component 10 7 5 net hedge gains associated with the 2011 bridge facility (a) 55 earnings (losses) from equity method investments (8) 1 2 gain on redemption of debt (b) 22 miscellaneous - domestic 11 10 3 miscellaneous - u.k. 2 1 1 total other income 42 127 39 other expense economic foreign currency exchange contracts (note 19) 52 (10) (3) charitable contributions 10 9 4 cash flow hedges (c) 29 lke acquisition-related costs (note 10) 31 wpd midlands acquisition-related costs (note 10) 34 foreign currency loss on 2011 bridge facility (d) 57 u.k. stamp duty tax (note 10) 21 miscellaneous - domestic 16 9 7 miscellaneous - u.k. 3 3 2 total other expense 81 123 70 other income (expense) - net $ (39) $ 4 $ (31) 361 successor predecessor two months ten months year ended year ended ended ended december 31, december 31, december 31, october 31, 2012 2011 2010 2010 lke other income net derivative gains (losses) $ 19 interest income $ 1 earnings (losses) from equity method investments $ (8) 1 3 life insurance 1 2 miscellaneous 3 2 1 total other income (4) 4 25 other expense charitable contributions 4 4 $ 1 5 joint-use-asset depreciation 3 miscellaneous 7 1 1 3 total other expense 11 5 2 11 other income (expense) - net $ (15) $ (1) $ (2) $ 14 lg&amp;e other income net derivative gains (losses) $ 19 miscellaneous $ 1 1 total other income 1 20 other expense charitable contributions 2 $ 1 2 miscellaneous 2 1 $ 3 1 total other expense 4 2 3 3 other income (expense) - net $ (3) $ (2) $ (3) $ 17 ku other income earnings (losses) from equity method investments $ (8) $ 1 $ 3 life insurance 1 2 miscellaneous 1 1 total other income (6) 1 6 other expense charitable contributions 1 1 1 joint-use-asset depreciation 3 miscellaneous 1 1 1 total other expense 2 2 5 other income (expense) - net $ (8) $ (1) $ 1 (a) represents a gain on foreign currency contracts that hedged the repayment of the 2011 bridge facility borrowing.

(c) represents losses reclassified from aoci into earnings associated with discontinued hedges at ppl for debt that had been planned to be issued by ppl energy supply. as a result of the expected net proceeds from the sale of certain non-core generation facilities, coupled with the monetization of full-requirement sales contracts, the debt issuance was no longer needed. (d) represents a foreign currency loss related to the repayment of the 2011 bridge facility borrowing. "other income (expense) - net" for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is primarily earnings on securities in ndt funds for ppl energy supply and the equity component of afudc for ppl electric. 18. fair value measurements and credit concentration (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). a market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models), and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) are used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability, as appropriate. these valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. these inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. the fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities is measured on a net basis. transfers between levels are recognized at end-of-reporting-period values. during 2012, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2. 362 recurring fair

energy commodities (ppl and ppl energy supply) energy commodity contracts are generally valued using the income approach, except for exchange-traded derivative gas and oil contracts, which are valued using the market approach and are classified as level 1. when the lowest level inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement of a contract are observable, the contract is classified as level 2. level 2 contracts are valued using inputs which may include quotes obtained from an exchange (where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in level 1), binding and non-binding broker quotes, prices posted by isos or published tariff rates. furthermore, independent quotes are obtained from the market to validate the forward price curves. these contracts include 366 forwards, swaps, options and structured transactions for electricity, gas, oil and/or emission allowances and may be offset with similar positions in exchange-traded markets. to the extent possible, fair value measurements utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs. in certain instances, these contracts may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models. for example, the fair value of a full-requirement sales contract that delivers power to an illiquid delivery point may be measured by valuing the nearest liquid trading point plus the value of the basis between the two points. the basis input may be from market quotes or historical prices. when unobservable inputs are significant to the fair value measurement, a contract is classified as level 3. the fair value of contracts classified as level 3 has been calculated using ppl proprietary models which include significant unobservable inputs such as delivery at a location where pricing is unobservable, assumptions for customer migration or delivery dates that are beyond the dates for which independent quotes are available. forward transactions, including forward transactions classified as level 3, are analyzed by ppl's risk management department, which reports to the chief financial officer (cfo). accounting personnel, who also report to the cfo, interpret the analysis quarterly to appropriately classify the forward transactions in the fair value hierarchy. valuation techniques are evaluated periodically. additionally, level 2 and level 3 fair value measurements include adjustments for credit risk based on ppl's own creditworthiness (for net liabilities) and its counterparties' creditworthiness (for net assets). ppl's credit department assesses all reasonably available market information which is used by accounting personnel to calculate the credit valuation adjustment. in certain instances, energy commodity contracts are transferred between level 2 and level 3. the primary reasons for the transfers during 2012 and 2011 were changes in the availability of market information and changes in the significance of the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation of the contract. as the delivery period of a contract becomes closer, market information may become available. when this occurs, the model's unobservable inputs are replaced with observable market information. price risk management assets/liabilities - interest rate swaps/foreign currency exchange contracts/cross-currency swaps (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) to manage interest rate risk, ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku use interest rate contracts such as forward-starting swaps, floating-to-fixed swaps and fixed-to-floating swaps. to manage foreign currency exchange risk, ppl uses foreign currency contracts such as forwards, options, and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency contracts. an income approach is used to measure the fair value of these contracts, utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates (e.g., libor and government security rates) and forward foreign currency exchange rates (e.g., gbp and euro), as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments. in certain cases, market information cannot practicably be obtained to value credit risk and therefore internal models are relied upon. these models use projected probabilities of default and estimated recovery rates based on historical observances. when the credit valuation adjustment is significant to the overall valuation, the contracts are classified as level 3. the primary reason for the transfers during 2012 and 2011 was the change in the significance of the credit valuation adjustment. cross-currency swaps classified as level 3 are valued by ppl's corporate finance department, which reports to the cfo. accounting personnel, who also report to the cfo, interpret analysis quarterly to appropriately classify the contracts in the fair value hierarchy. valuation techniques are evaluated periodically. (ppl and ppl energy supply) ndt funds the market approach is used to measure the fair value of equity securities held in the ndt funds. the fair value measurements of equity securities classified as level 1 are based on quoted prices in active markets and are comprised of securities that are representative of the wilshire 5000 total market index. investments in commingled equity funds are classified as level 2 and represent securities that track the s&amp;p 500 index, dow jones u.s. total stock market index and the dow jones u.s. completion total stock market index. these fair value measurements are based on firm quotes of net asset values per share, which are not obtained from a quoted price in an active market. debt securities are generally measured using a market approach, including the use of matrix pricing. common inputs include reported trades, broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments. when necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as benchmark yields, credit valuation adjustments, reference data from market research publications, monthly payment data, collateral performance and new issue data. 367 the debt securities held by the ndt funds at december 31, 2012 have a weighted-average coupon of 4.11% and a weighted-average maturity of 8.26 years. auction rate securities auction rate securities include federal family education loan program guaranteed student loan revenue bonds, as well as various municipal bond issues. the exposure to realize losses on these securities is not significant. the fair value of auction rate securities is estimated using an income approach that includes readily observable inputs, such as principal payments and discount curves for bonds with credit ratings and maturities similar to the securities, and unobservable inputs, such as future interest rates that are estimated based on the sifma index, creditworthiness, and liquidity assumptions driven by the impact of auction failures. when the present value of future interest payments is significant to the overall valuation, the auction rate securities are classified as level 3. the primary reason for the transfer out of level 3 in 2012 was the change in the significance of the present value of future interest payments as maturity dates approach. auction rate securities are valued by ppl's treasury department, which reports to the cfo. accounting personnel, who also report to the cfo, interpret the analysis quarterly to appropriately classify the contracts in the fair value hierarchy. valuation techniques are evaluated periodically. nonrecurring fair value measurements (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke and ku) the following nonrecurring fair value measurements occurred during the reporting periods, resulting in asset impairments. carrying fair value measurements using amount (a) level 2 level 3 loss (b) ppl, lke and ku equity investment in eei: december 31, 2012 $ 25 $ 25 ppl and ppl energy supply sulfur dioxide emission allowances (c): december 31, 2010 2 $ 1 1 september 30, 2010 6 2 4 june 30, 2010 11 3 8 march 31, 2010 13 10 3 recs (c): september 30, 2011 1 1 june 30, 2011 2 $ 1 1 march 31, 2011 3 3 certain non-core generation facilities: september 30, 2010 473 381 96 (a) represents carrying value before fair value measurement.

(c) current and long-term sulfur dioxide emission allowances and recs are included in "other current assets" and "other intangibles" in their respective areas on the balance sheets. the significant unobservable inputs used in the nonrecurring fair value measurement of assets and liabilities classified as level 3 at december 31, 2012 are as follows: quantitative information about level 3 fair value measurements fair value, net range asset valuation unobservable (weighted (liability) technique input(s) average) ppl, lke, and ku equity investment in eei $ discounted cash flow long-term forward price curves and capital expenditure projections 100% (100%) 368 equity investment in eei (ppl, lke and ku) during the fourth quarter 2012, ku recorded an other-than-temporary decline in the value of its equity investment in eei. ku performed an internal analysis using an income approach based on discounted cash flows to assess the current fair value of its investment based on several factors. ku considered the following factors: long-dated forward power and fuel price curves, the cost of compliance with environmental standards, and the majority owner and operator's announcement in the fourth quarter 2012 to exit from the merchant generation business. assumptions used in the fair value assessment were forward energy price curves, expectations for capacity (demand) for energy in eei's market, and expected capital expenditures used in the calculation that were comparable to assumptions used by ku for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes. through this analysis, ku determined the fair value to be zero. (ppl and ppl energy supply) sulfur dioxide emission allowances due to declines in market prices, ppl energy supply assessed the recoverability of sulfur dioxide emission allowances not expected to be consumed. when available, observable market prices were used to value the sulfur dioxide emission allowances. when observable market prices were not available, fair value was modeled using prices from observable transactions and appropriate discount rates. the modeled values were significant to the overall fair value measurement, resulting in the level 3 classification. recs due to declines in forecasted full-requirement obligations in certain markets as well as declines in market prices, ppl energy supply assessed the recoverability of certain recs not expected to be used. observable market prices (level 2) were used to value the recs. certain non-core generation facilities certain non-core generation facilities met the held for sale criteria at september 30, 2010. as a result, net assets held for sale were written down to their estimated fair value less cost to sell. the fair value in the table above excludes $4 million of estimated costs to sell and was based on the negotiated sales price (achieved through an active auction process). see note 9 for additional information on the completed sale. financial instruments not recorded at fair value (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the carrying amounts of contract adjustment payments related to the purchase contract component of the equity units and long-term debt on the balance sheets and their estimated fair values are set forth below. the fair values of these instruments were estimated using an income approach by discounting future cash flows at estimated current cost of funding rates, which incorporate the credit risk of the registrants. these instruments are classified as level 2. the effect of third-party credit enhancements is not included in the fair value measurement. december 31, 2012 december 31, 2011 carrying carrying amount fair value amount fair value ppl contract adjustment payments (a) $ 105 $ 106 $ 198 $ 198 long-term debt 19,476 21,671 17,993 19,392 ppl energy supply long-term debt 3,272 3,556 3,024 3,397 ppl electric long-term debt 1,967 2,333 1,718 2,012 lke long-term debt 4,075 4,423 4,073 4,306 lg&amp;e long-term debt 1,112 1,178 1,112 1,164 ku long-term debt 1,842 2,056 1,842 2,000 (a) included in "other current liabilities" and "other deferred credits and noncurrent liabilities" on the balance sheets. 369 the carrying value of short-term debt (including notes between affiliates), when outstanding, represents or approximates fair value due to the variable interest rates associated with the financial instruments and is classified as level 2. the carrying value of held-to-maturity, short-term investments at december 31, 2011 approximated fair value due to the liquid nature and short-term duration of these instruments. credit concentration associated with financial instruments (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) contracts are entered into with many entities for the purchase and sale of energy. many of these contracts qualify for npns and, as such, the fair value of these contracts is not reflected in the financial statements. however, the fair value of these contracts is considered when committing to new business from a credit perspective. see note 19 for information on credit policies used to manage credit risk, including master netting arrangements and collateral requirements. (ppl) at december 31, 2012, ppl had credit exposure of $1.8 billion from energy trading partners, excluding the effects of netting arrangements and collateral. as a result of netting arrangements and collateral, ppl's credit exposure was reduced to $688 million. the top ten counterparties accounted for $367 million, or 53%, of the net exposure and all had investment grade credit ratings from s&amp;p or moody's. (ppl energy supply) at december 31, 2012, ppl energy supply had credit exposure of $1.8 billion from energy trading partners, excluding exposure from related parties and the effects of netting arrangements and collateral. as a result of netting arrangements and collateral, this credit exposure was reduced to $688 million. the top ten counterparties accounted for $367 million, or 53%, of the net exposure and all had investment grade credit ratings from s&amp;p or moody's. see note 16 for information regarding the related party credit exposure. (ppl electric) at december 31, 2012, ppl electric had no credit exposure under energy supply contracts (including its supply contracts with ppl energyplus). (lke, lg&amp;e and ku) at december 31, 2012, lke's, lg&amp;e's and ku's credit exposure was not significant. 19. derivative instruments and hedging activities risk management objectives (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl has a risk management policy approved by the board of directors to manage market risk (including price, liquidity and volumetric risk) and credit risk (including non-performance risk and payment default risk). the rmc, comprised of senior management and chaired by the chief risk officer, oversees the risk management function. key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval, validation of transactions and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, var analyses, portfolio stress tests, gross margin at risk analyses, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting, including open positions, determinations of fair value and other risk management metrics. market risk market risk includes the potential loss that may be incurred as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument as well as liquidity and volumetric risks. forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured transactions, such as tolling agreements, are utilized as part of risk management strategies to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in commodity prices, volumes of full-requirement sales contracts, basis exposure, interest rates and/or foreign currency exchange rates. many of the contracts meet the definition of a derivative. all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheets at their fair value, unless they qualify for npns. 370 the table below summarizes the market risks that affect ppl and its subsidiaries. ppl ppl ppl energy supply electric lke lg&amp;e ku commodity price risk (including basis and volumetric risk) x x m m m m interest rate risk: debt issuances x x m m m m defined benefit plans x x m m m m ndt securities x x equity securities price risk: defined benefit plans x x m m m m ndt securities x x future stock transactions x foreign currency risk - wpd investment x x = ppl and ppl energy supply actively mitigate market risks through their risk management programs described above. m = the regulatory environments for ppl's regulated entities, by definition, significantly mitigate market risk. commodity price and volumetric risks ppl energy supply is exposed to commodity price, basis and volumetric risks for energy and energy-related products associated with the sale of electricity from its generating assets and other electricity and gas marketing activities (including full-requirement sales contracts) and the purchase of fuel and fuel-related commodities for generating assets, as well as for proprietary trading activities; ppl electric is exposed to commodity price and volumetric risks from its obligation as plr; however, its puc-approved cost recovery mechanism substantially eliminates its exposure to market risk. ppl electric also mitigates its exposure to volumetric risk by entering into full-requirement supply agreements to serve its plr customers. these supply agreements transfer the volumetric risk associated with the plr obligation to the energy suppliers; and lg&amp;e's and ku's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, gas supply and environmental expenses. these mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price and volumetric fluctuations associated with these expenses. interest rate risk ppl and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with forecasted fixed-rate and existing floating-rate debt issuances. wpd holds over-the-counter cross currency swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on interest and principal payments from foreign currency exchange rates. lg&amp;e utilizes over-the-counter interest rate swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on floating-rate debt and lg&amp;e and ku utilize forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge changes in benchmark interest rates. ppl and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities held by defined benefit plans. additionally, ppl energy supply is exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities held by the ndt. equity securities price risk ppl and its subsidiaries are exposed to equity securities price risk associated with equity securities held by defined benefit plans. additionally, ppl energy supply is exposed to equity securities price risk in the ndt funds. ppl is exposed to equity securities price risk from future stock sales and/or purchases. foreign currency risk ppl is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk primarily associated with its investments in u.k. affiliates. credit risk credit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance, including defaults on payments and energy commodity deliveries. ppl is exposed to credit risk from "in-the-money" interest rate and foreign currency derivatives with financial institutions, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below. 371 ppl energy supply is exposed to credit risk from "in-the-money" commodity derivatives with its energy trading partners, which include other energy companies, fuel suppliers and financial institutions. lke, lg&amp;e and ku are exposed to credit risk from "in-the-money" interest rate derivatives with financial institutions. the majority of credit risk stems from commodity derivatives for multi-year contracts for energy sales and purchases. if ppl energy supply's counterparties fail to perform their obligations under such contracts and ppl energy supply could not replace the sales or purchases at the same or better prices as those under the defaulted contracts, ppl energy supply would incur financial losses. those losses would be recognized immediately or through lower revenues or higher costs in future years, depending on the accounting treatment for the defaulted contracts. in the event a supplier of lke (through its subsidiaries lg&amp;e and ku) or ppl electric defaults on its obligation, those entities would be required to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. in general, incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers in future rates, thus mitigating the risk for these entities. ppl and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements. these agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. ppl and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade or their exposures exceed an established credit limit. see note 18 for credit concentration associated with energy trading partners. master netting arrangements net derivative positions are not offset against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements. ppl's and ppl energy supply's obligation to return counterparty cash collateral under master netting arrangements was $112 million and $147 million at december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011. ppl electric, lke, and lg&amp;e had no obligation to return cash collateral under master netting arrangements at december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011. ppl, lke and lg&amp;e had posted cash collateral under master netting arrangements of $32 million at december 31, 2012 and $29 million at december 31, 2011. ppl energy supply and ppl electric had not posted any cash collateral under master netting arrangements at december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011. (ppl and ppl energy supply) commodity price risk (non-trading) commodity price risk, including basis and volumetric risk, is among ppl's and ppl energy supply's most significant risks due to the level of investment that ppl and ppl energy supply maintain in their competitive generation assets, as well as the extent of their marketing activities. several factors influence price levels and volatilities. these factors include, but are not limited to, seasonal changes in demand, weather conditions, available generating assets within regions, transportation/transmission availability and reliability within and between regions, market liquidity, and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations. ppl energy supply maximizes the value of its wholesale and retail energy portfolios through the use of non-trading strategies that include sales of competitive baseload generation, optimization of competitive intermediate and peaking generation and marketing activities. ppl energy supply has a formal hedging program to economically hedge the forecasted purchase and sale of electricity and related fuels for its competitive baseload generation fleet, which includes 7,275 mw (summer rating) of nuclear, coal and hydroelectric generating capacity. ppl energy supply attempts to optimize the overall value of its competitive intermediate and peaking fleet, which includes 3,316 mw (summer rating) of natural gas and oil-fired generation. ppl energy supply's marketing portfolio is comprised of full-requirement sales contracts and related supply contracts, retail natural gas and electricity sales contracts and other marketing activities. the strategies that ppl energy supply uses to hedge its full- 372 requirement sales contracts include purchasing energy (at a liquid trading hub or directly at the load delivery zone), capacity and recs in the market and/or supplying the energy, capacity and recs from its generation assets. ppl and ppl energy supply enter into financial and physical derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options, to hedge the price risk associated with electricity, natural gas, oil and other commodities. certain contracts qualify for npns or are non-derivatives and are therefore not reflected in the financial statements until delivery. ppl and ppl energy supply segregate their non-trading activities into two categories: cash flow hedges and economic activity. in addition, the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts in 2010 impacted both the cash flow hedge and economic activity, as discussed below. monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts in july 2010, in order to raise additional cash for the lke acquisition, ppl energy supply monetized certain full-requirement sales contracts that resulted in cash proceeds of $249 million and triggered certain accounting: a portion of these sales contracts had previously been accounted for as npns and received accrual accounting treatment. ppl energy supply could no longer assert that it was probable that any contracts with these counterparties would result in physical delivery. therefore, the fair value of the npns contracts of $160 million was recorded on the balance sheet in "price risk management assets," with a corresponding gain of $144 million recorded to "wholesale energy marketing - realized" on the statement of income, and $16 million recorded to "wholesale energy marketing - unrealized economic activity," related to full-requirement sales contracts that had not been monetized. the related purchases to supply these sales contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the effective portion of the change in fair value being recorded in aoci and the ineffective portion recorded in "energy purchases - unrealized economic activity." the corresponding cash flow hedges were dedesignated and all amounts previously recorded in aoci were reclassified to earnings. this resulted in a pre-tax reclassification of $(173) million of losses from aoci into "energy purchases - unrealized economic activity" on the statement of income. an additional charge of $(39) million was also recorded in "wholesale energy marketing - unrealized economic activity" on the statement of income to reflect the fair value of the sales contracts previously accounted for as economic activity. the net result of these transactions, excluding the full-requirement sales contracts that have not been monetized, was a loss of $(68) million, or $(40) million, after tax. the proceeds of $249 million from these monetizations are reflected in the statement of cash flows as a component of "net cash provided by operating activities." cash flow hedges certain derivative contracts have qualified for hedge accounting so that the effective portion of a derivative's gain or loss is deferred in aoci and reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs. the cash flow hedges that existed at december 31, 2012 range in maturity through 2016. at december 31, 2012, the accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains (losses) that are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months were $124 million for ppl and ppl energy supply. cash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time periods and any amounts previously recorded in aoci are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedge transaction is probable of not occurring. for 2012 and 2011 such reclassifications were insignificant. for 2010, such reclassifications were after-tax gains (losses) of $(89) million. the amounts recorded in 2010 were primarily due to the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts, for which the associated hedges are no longer required, as discussed above. hedge ineffectiveness associated with energy derivatives was insignificant in 2012. for 2011 and 2010, after-tax gains (losses) from hedge ineffectiveness were $(22) million and $(30) million. prior to the adoption of new accounting guidance, in 2010, after-tax gains of $82 million, which had been recognized in a previous period due to ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges, were reversed from earnings based on prospective regression analysis demonstrating that these hedges were expected to be highly effective over their term. 373 economic activity many derivative contracts economically hedge the commodity price risk associated with electricity, natural gas, oil and other commodities but do not receive hedge accounting treatment because they were not eligible for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting was not elected. these derivatives hedge a portion of the economic value of ppl energy supply's competitive generation assets and unregulated full-requirement and retail contracts, which are subject to changes in fair value due to market price volatility and volume expectations. additionally, economic activity includes the ineffective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges (see "cash flow hedges" above). the derivative contracts in this category that existed at december 31, 2012 range in maturity through 2019. examples of economic activity include hedges on sales of baseload generation, certain purchase contracts used to supply full-requirement sales contracts, ftrs or basis swaps used to hedge basis risk associated with the sale of competitive generation or supplying unregulated full-requirement sales contracts, spark spread hedging contracts, retail electric and natural gas activities, and fuel oil swaps used to hedge price escalation clauses in coal transportation and other fuel-related contracts. ppl energy supply also uses options, which include the sale of call options and the purchase of put options tied to a particular generating unit. since the physical generating capacity is owned, price exposure is generally limited to the cost of the generating unit and does not expose ppl energy supply to uncovered market price risk. unrealized activity associated with monetizing certain full-requirement sales contracts was also included in economic activity during 2012, 2011 and 2010. the net fair value of economic positions at december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011 was a net asset (liability) of $346 million and $(63) million for ppl and ppl energy supply. the unrealized gains (losses) for economic activity were as follows. 2012 2011 2010 operating revenues unregulated retail electric and gas $ (17) $ 31 $ 1 wholesale energy marketing (311) 1,407 (805) operating expenses fuel (14) 6 29 energy purchases 442 (1,123) 286 the net gains (losses) recorded in "wholesale energy marketing" resulted primarily from hedges of baseload generation, from certain full-requirement sales contracts, from hedge ineffectiveness, as discussed in "cash flow hedges" above, and from the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts in 2010, also discussed above. the net gains (losses) recorded in "energy purchases" resulted primarily from certain purchase contracts to supply the full-requirement sales contracts noted above, from hedge ineffectiveness, and from purchase contracts that no longer hedge the full-requirement sales contracts that were monetized in 2010. (ppl and ppl energy supply) commodity price risk (trading) ppl energy supply also has a proprietary trading strategy which is utilized to take advantage of market opportunities. as a result, ppl energy supply may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated. the proprietary trading portfolio is not a significant part of ppl energy supply's business and is shown in "net energy trading margins" on the statements of income. commodity volumetric activity as of december 31, 2012, the net notional volumes of derivative (sales)/purchase contracts used in support of the various strategies discussed above were as follows. volume commodity unit of measure 2013 2014 2015 thereafter power mwh (38,791,951) (16,720,361) 1,636,197 3,871,199 capacity mw-month (8,248,465) (135,110) (37,208) 525 gas mmbtu 18,419,599 (21,663,269) (10,386,745) (5,027,288) coal tons (240,000) ftrs mw-month 28,690 6,389 1,465 oil barrels (4,022,000) 240,000 300,000 180,000 374 interest rate risk (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. various financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolio, adjust the duration of the debt portfolio and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. risk limits under ppl's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the subsidiaries' debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. cash flow hedges (ppl) interest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings. financial interest rate swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges may be entered into to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. outstanding interest rate swap contracts ranged in maturity through 2024 for wpd and through 2043 for ppl's domestic interest rate swaps. these swaps had an aggregate notional value of $1.2 billion at december 31, 2012, of which 290 million (approximately $465 million based on spot rates) was related to wpd. included in this total are forward-starting interest rate swaps entered into by ppl on behalf of lg&amp;e and ku. lg&amp;e and ku believe that realized gains and losses from the swaps are probable of recovery through regulated rates; as such, the fair value of these derivatives have been reclassified from aoci to regulatory assets or liabilities. the gains and losses will be recognized in "interest expense" on the statements of income over the life of the underlying debt when the hedged transaction occurs. ppl holds a notional position in cross-currency interest rate swaps totaling $1.3 billion that mature through 2028 to hedge the interest payments and principal of wpd's u.s. dollar-denominated senior notes. for 2012, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate derivatives was insignificant. for 2011, hedge ineffectiveness associated with these derivatives resulted in a net after-tax gain (loss) of $(9) million, which included a gain (loss) of $(4) million attributable to certain interest rate swaps that failed hedge effectiveness testing during the second quarter of 2011. for 2010, hedge ineffectiveness associated with these derivatives resulted in a net after-tax gain (loss) of $(9) million. cash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time periods and any amounts previously recorded in aoci are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedged transaction is probable of not occurring. ppl had no such reclassifications for 2012 and 2011. as a result of the expected net proceeds from the anticipated sale of certain non-core generation facilities, coupled with the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts, debt that had been planned to be issued by ppl energy supply in 2010 was no longer needed. as a result, hedge accounting associated with interest rate swaps entered into by ppl in anticipation of a debt issuance by ppl energy supply was discontinued. ppl reclassified into earnings a net after-tax gain (loss) of $(19) million in 2010. at december 31, 2012, the accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains (losses) on qualifying derivatives that are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months were $(13) million. amounts are reclassified as the hedged interest payments are made. (lke, lg&amp;e and ku) in november 2012, lg&amp;e and ku entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with ppl that hedge the interest payments on new debt that is expected to be issued in 2013. these hedging instruments have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by ppl with third parties. lg&amp;e and ku believe that realized gains and losses from the swaps are probable of recovery through regulated rates; as such, the fair value of these derivatives have been reclassified from aoci to regulatory assets or liabilities. the gains and losses will be recognized in "interest expense" on the statements of income over the life of the underlying debt when the hedged transaction occurs. at december 31, 2012, lg&amp;e and ku each held contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $150 million that range in maturity through 2043. (ppl energy supply) in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its membership interest in ppl global to ppl energy supply's parent, ppl energy funding. therefore, effective january 2011, ppl energy supply is no longer subject to interest rate risk associated with investments in u.k. affiliates. for 2010, hedge ineffectiveness associated with these derivatives was insignificant for 375 interest rate cross-currency swaps contracts. for 2010, ppl energy supply had no reclassifications for cash flows hedges that were discontinued when it was no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction would occur by the end of the originally specified period. fair value hedges (ppl) ppl is exposed to changes in the fair value of its debt portfolio. to manage this risk, financial contracts may be entered into to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of existing debt issuances due to changes in benchmark interest rates. in july 2012, contracts held by ppl that ranged in maturity through 2047 and had a notional value of $99 million were canceled without penalties by the counterparties. ppl did not hold any such contracts at december 31, 2012. ppl did not recognize gains or losses resulting from the ineffective portion of fair value hedges or from a portion of the hedging instrument being excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness or from hedges of debt issuances that no longer qualified as fair value hedges for 2012, 2011 and 2010. in 2011, ppl electric redeemed $400 million of 7.125% senior secured bonds due 2013. as a result of this redemption, ppl recorded a gain (loss) of $22 million, or $14 million after tax, for 2011 in "other income (expense) - net" on the statement of income as a result of accelerated amortization of the fair value adjustments to the debt in connection with previously settled fair value hedges. (ppl energy supply) in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its membership interest in ppl global to ppl energy supply's parent, ppl energy funding. therefore, effective january 2011, ppl energy supply is no longer subject to interest rate risk associated with investments in u.k. affiliates. ppl energy supply did not recognize gains or losses resulting from the ineffective portion of fair value hedges or from a portion of the hedging instrument being excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness or resulting from hedges of debt issuances that no longer qualified as fair value hedges for 2010. economic activity (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) lg&amp;e enters into interest rate swap contracts that economically hedge interest payments on variable rate debt. because realized gains and losses from the swaps, including a terminated swap contract, are recoverable through regulated rates, any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. realized gains and losses are recognized in "interest expense" on the statements of income when the hedged transaction occurs. at december 31, 2012, lg&amp;e held contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $179 million that range in maturity through 2033. the fair value of these contracts were recorded as liabilities of $58 million and $60 million at december 31, 2012 and 2011, with equal offsetting amounts recorded as regulatory assets. foreign currency risk (ppl) ppl is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in u.k. affiliates. ppl has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments. in addition, ppl enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected earnings. net investment hedges ppl enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary to protect the value of a portion of its net investment in wpd. the contracts outstanding at december 31, 2012 had an aggregate notional amount of 162 million (approximately $261 million based on contracted rates). the settlement dates of these contracts range from may 2013 through december 2013. at december 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of these positions was a net asset (liability) of $(2) million and $7 million. additionally, in 2012, a ppl global subsidiary that has a u.s. dollar functional currency entered into a gbp intercompany loan payable with a ppl wem subsidiary that has a gbp functional currency. the loan qualifies as a net investment hedge for the ppl global subsidiary. as such, the foreign currency gains and losses on the intercompany loan for the ppl global subsidiary are recorded to the foreign currency translation adjustment component of aoci. at december 31, 2012, the intercompany loan outstanding was 47 million (approximately $76 million based on spot rates). 376 for 2012, ppl recognized after-tax net investment hedge gains (losses) of $(5) million in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of aoci. for 2011 and 2010, ppl recognized after-tax net investment hedge gains (losses) of $4 million in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of aoci. at december 31, 2012 and 2011, ppl had $14 million and $19 million of accumulated net investment hedge after-tax gains (losses) that were included in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of aoci. (ppl energy supply) in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its membership interest in ppl global to ppl energy supply's parent, ppl energy funding. therefore, effective january 2011, ppl energy supply is no longer subject to foreign currency exchange risk associated with investments in u.k. affiliates. for 2010, ppl energy supply recognized insignificant amounts in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of aoci. cash flow hedges (ppl) ppl may enter into foreign currency derivatives associated with foreign currency-denominated debt and the exchange rate associated with firm commitments (including those for the purchase of equipment) denominated in foreign currencies; however, at december 31, 2012, there were no existing contracts of this nature. amounts previously settled and recorded in aoci are reclassified as the hedged interest payments are made and as the related equipment is depreciated. insignificant amounts are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. during 2012, 2011 and 2010, no cash flow hedges were discontinued because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur by the end of the originally specified time periods. fair value hedges ppl enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk associated with firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies; however, at december 31, 2012, there were no existing contracts of this nature and no gains or losses recorded for 2012, 2011 and 2010 related to hedge ineffectiveness, or from a portion of the hedging instrument being excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, or from hedges of firm commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges. economic activity ppl enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary to economically hedge gbp-denominated anticipated earnings. at december 31, 2012, the total exposure hedged by ppl was approximately 1.3 billion (approximately $2.0 billion based on contracted rates) and the net fair value of these positions was an asset (liability) of $(42) million. these contracts had termination dates ranging from january 2013 through february 2015. realized and unrealized gains (losses) on these contracts are included in "other income (expense) - net" on the statements of income and were $(52) million for 2012. at december 31, 2011, the total exposure hedged by ppl was 288 million and the net fair value of these positions was an asset (liability) of $11 million. realized and unrealized gains (losses) were $10 million for 2011 and insignificant for 2010. in anticipation of the repayment of a portion of the gbp-denominated borrowings under the 2011 bridge facility with u.s. dollar proceeds received from ppl's issuance of common stock and 2011 equity units and ppl wem's issuance of u.s. dollar-denominated senior notes, ppl entered into forward contracts to purchase gbp in order to economically hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to the repayment. when these trades were settled in april 2011, ppl recorded $55 million of pre-tax, net gains (losses) in "other income (expense) - net" on the statements of income. (ppl energy supply) in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its membership interest in ppl global to ppl energy supply's parent, ppl energy funding. therefore, effective january 2011, ppl energy supply is no longer subject to earnings denominated in british pounds sterling. ppl energy supply recorded gains (losses) on these contracts, both realized and unrealized, in "income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes)" on the statements of income. for 2010, ppl energy supply recorded insignificant gains (losses). 377 accounting and reporting (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability unless they qualify for npns. npns contracts for ppl and ppl energy supply include full-requirement sales contracts, other physical purchases and sales contracts and certain retail energy and physical capacity contracts, and for ppl electric include full-requirement purchase contracts and other physical purchase contracts. changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as npns are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met, except for the changes in fair value of lg&amp;e's and ku's interest rate swaps, which beginning in the third quarter of 2010, are recognized as regulatory assets or liabilities. see note 6 for amounts recorded in regulatory assets at december 31, 2012 and 2011. see note 1 for additional information on accounting policies related to derivative instruments.

(ppl and ppl energy supply) ppl energy supply has recorded liabilities in the financial statements to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets, the most significant of which relates to the decommissioning of the susquehanna nuclear plant. the accrued nuclear decommissioning obligation was $316 million and $292 million at december 31, 2012 and 2011. the fair value of investments that are legally restricted for the decommissioning of the susquehanna nuclear plant was $712 million and $640 million at december 31, 2012 and 2011, and is included in "nuclear plant decommissioning trust funds" on the balance sheets. see notes 18 and 23 for additional information on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds. other aros recorded relate to various environmental requirements for coal piles, ash basins and other waste basin retirements. ppl energy supply has recorded several conditional aros, the most significant of which related to the removal and disposal of asbestos-containing material. in addition to the aros that were recorded for asbestos-containing material, ppl energy supply identified other asbestos-related obligations, but was unable to reasonably estimate their fair values. ppl energy supply management was unable to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates for the remediation of all of the asbestos-containing material at certain of the generation plants. if economic events or other circumstances change that enable ppl energy supply to reasonably estimate the fair value of these retirement obligations, they will be recorded at that time. ppl energy supply also identified legal retirement obligations associated with the retirement of a reservoir that could not be reasonably estimated due to an indeterminable settlement date. 387 (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric has identified legal retirement obligations for the retirement of certain transmission assets that could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates. these assets are located on rights-of-way that allow the grantor to require ppl electric to relocate or remove the assets. since this option is at the discretion of the grantor of the right-of-way, ppl electric is unable to determine when these events may occur. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lg&amp;e's and ku's aros are primarily related to the final retirement of assets associated with generating units. lg&amp;e also has aros related to natural gas mains and wells. lg&amp;e's and ku's transmission and distribution lines largely operate under perpetual property easement agreements which do not generally require restoration upon removal of the property. therefore, no material aros are recorded for transmission and distribution assets. as described in notes 1 and 6, the accretion and depreciation expense recorded by lg&amp;e and ku is offset with a regulatory credit on the income statement, such that there is no earnings impact. (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) the changes in the carrying amounts of aros were as follows. ppl ppl energy supply 2012 2011 2012 2011 aro at beginning of period $ 497 $ 448 $ 359 $ 345 accretion expense 36 33 28 26 obligations assumed in acquisition of wpd midlands (a) 15 derecognition (b) (5) obligations incurred 9 14 3 11 changes in estimated cash flow or settlement date 31 5 (7) (1) effect of foreign currency exchange rates 1 obligations settled (22) (18) (8) (17) aro at end of period $ 552 $ 497 $ 375 $ 359 lke lg&amp;e ku 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 aro at beginning of period $ 118 $ 103 $ 57 $ 49 $ 61 $ 54 accretion expense 6 6 3 3 3 3 obligations incurred 6 3 2 6 1 changes in estimated cash flow or settlement date 15 7 5 4 10 3 obligations settled (14) (1) (3) (1) (11) aro at end of period $ 131 $ 118 $ 62 $ 57 $ 69 $ 61 (a) obligations required under u.k. law related to treated wood poles, gas-filled switchgear and fluid-filled cables. see note 10 for additional information on the acquisition. (b) represents aros derecognized as a result of ppl energy supply's distribution of its membership interest in ppl global to ppl energy supply's parent, ppl energy funding. see note 9 for additional information on the distribution. substantially all of the aro balances are classified as noncurrent at december 31, 2012 and 2011. 22. variable interest entities (ppl and ppl energy supply) in december 2001, a subsidiary of ppl energy supply entered into a $455 million operating lease arrangement, as lessee, for the development, construction and operation of a gas-fired combined-cycle generation facility located in lower mt. bethel township, northampton county, pennsylvania. the owner/lessor of this generation facility, lmb funding, lp, was created to own/lease the facility and incur the related financing costs. the initial lease term commenced on the date of commercial operation, which occurred in may 2004, and ends in december 2013. under a residual value guarantee, if the generation facility is sold at the end of the lease term and the cash proceeds from the sale are less than the original acquisition cost, the subsidiary of ppl energy supply is obligated to pay up to 70.52% of the original acquisition cost. this residual value guarantee protects the other variable interest holders from losses related to their investments. lmb funding, lp cannot 388 extend or cancel the lease or sell the facility without the prior consent of the ppl energy supply subsidiary. as a result, lmb funding, lp was determined to be a vie and the subsidiary of ppl energy supply was considered the primary beneficiary that consolidates this vie. the lease financing, which includes $437 million of debt and $18 million of "noncontrolling interests" at december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011, is secured by, among other things, the generation facility, the carrying amount of which is disclosed on the balance sheets. the debt matures in december 2013, the end of the initial lease term, and therefore has been classified in "long-term debt due within one year" at december 31, 2012. as a result of the consolidation, ppl energy supply has recorded interest expense in lieu of rent expense. for 2012, 2011 and 2010, additional depreciation on the generation facility of $16 million was recorded each year. 23. available-for-sale securities (ppl, ppl energy supply, lke and lg&amp;e) certain short-term investments, securities held by the ndt funds and auction rate securities are classified as available-for-sale. the following table shows the amortized cost, the gross unrealized gains and losses recorded in aoci and the fair value of available-for-sale securities. december 31, 2012 december 31, 2011 gross gross gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized amortized unrealized unrealized cost gains losses fair value cost gains losses fair value ppl ndt funds: cash and cash equivalents $ 11 $ 11 $ 12 $ 12 equity securities: u.s. large-cap 222 $ 190 412 211 $ 146 357 u.s. mid/small-cap 30 30 60 29 23 52 debt securities: u.s. treasury 86 9 95 76 10 86 u.s. government sponsored agency 8 1 9 9 1 10 municipality 78 5 $ 1 82 80 4 $ 1 83 investment-grade corporate 36 4 40 35 3 38 other 3 3 2 2 total ndt funds 474 239 1 712 454 187 1 640 auction rate securities 20 1 19 25 1 24 total $ 494 $ 239 $ 2 $ 731 $ 479 $ 187 $ 2 $ 664 ppl energy supply ndt funds: cash and cash equivalents $ 11 $ 11 $ 12 $ 12 equity securities: u.s. large-cap 222 $ 190 412 211 $ 146 357 u.s. mid/small-cap 30 30 60 29 23 52 debt securities: u.s. treasury 86 9 95 76 10 86 u.s. government sponsored agency 8 1 9 9 1 10 municipality 78 5 $ 1 82 80 4 $ 1 83 investment-grade corporate 36 4 40 35 3 38 other 3 3 2 2 total ndt funds 474 239 1 712 454 187 1 640 auction rate securities 17 1 16 20 1 19 total $ 491 $ 239 $ 2 $ 728 $ 474 $ 187 $ 2 $ 659 there were no securities with credit losses at december 31, 2012 and 2011. the following table shows the scheduled maturity dates of debt securities held at december 31, 2012. 389 maturity maturity maturity maturity less than 1-5 6-10 in excess 1 year years years of 10 years total ppl amortized cost $ 12 $ 79 $ 62 $ 78 $ 231 fair value 12 83 68 85 248 ppl energy supply amortized cost $ 12 $ 79 $ 62 $ 75 $ 228 fair value 12 83 68 82 245 the following table shows proceeds from and realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities. 2012 2011 2010 ppl proceeds from sales of ndt securities (a) $ 139 $ 156 $ 114 other proceeds from sales 5 163 gross realized gains (b) 29 28 13 gross realized losses (b) 21 16 5 ppl energy supply proceeds from sales of ndt securities (a) $ 139 $ 156 $ 114 other proceeds from sales 3 gross realized gains (b) 29 28 13 gross realized losses (b) 21 16 5 (a) these proceeds are used to pay income taxes and fees related to managing the trust. remaining proceeds are reinvested in the trust. (b) excludes the impact of other-than-temporary impairment charges recognized on the statements of income. short-term investments (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) at december 31, 2010, lg&amp;e held $163 million aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt revenue bonds issued by louisville/jefferson county, kentucky on behalf of lg&amp;e that were purchased from the remarketing agent in 2008. in 2011, lg&amp;e received $163 million for its investments in these bonds when they were remarketed to unaffiliated investors. no realized or unrealized gains (losses) were recorded on these securities, as the difference between carrying value and fair value was not significant. ndt funds (ppl and ppl energy supply) amounts previously collected from ppl electric's customers for decommissioning the susquehanna nuclear plant, less applicable taxes, were deposited in external trust funds for investment and can only be used for future decommissioning costs. to the extent that the actual costs for decommissioning exceed the amounts in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds, ppl susquehanna would be obligated to fund 90% of the shortfall. when the fair value of a security is less than amortized cost, ppl and ppl energy supply must make certain assertions to avoid recording an other-than-temporary impairment that requires a current period charge to earnings. the nrc requires that nuclear decommissioning trusts be managed by independent investment managers, with discretion to buy and sell securities in the trusts. as a result, ppl and ppl energy supply have been unable to demonstrate the ability to hold an impaired security until it recovers its value; therefore, unrealized losses on equity securities for all periods presented, represented other-than-temporary impairments that required a current period charge to earnings. ppl and ppl energy supply recorded impairments for certain securities invested in the ndt funds of $1 million, $6 million and $3 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010. these impairments are reflected on the statements of income in "other-than-temporary impairments." 24. new accounting guidance pending adoption (ppl, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) improving disclosures about offsetting balance sheet items effective january 1, 2013, the registrants will retrospectively adopt accounting guidance issued to enhance disclosures about derivative instruments that either (1) offset on the balance sheet or (2) are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset on the balance sheet. upon adoption, the enhanced disclosure requirements are not expected to have a significant impact on the registrants. 390 testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment effective january 1, 2013, the registrants will prospectively adopt accounting guidance that allows an entity to elect the option to first make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. if, based on this assessment, the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the carrying amount, the fair value of that asset does not need to be calculated. if the entity concludes otherwise, a quantitative impairment test must be performed by determining the fair value of the asset and comparing it with the carrying value. the entity would record an impairment charge, if necessary. upon adoption, the guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the registrants. reporting amounts reclassified out of aoci effective january 1, 2013, the registrants will prospectively adopt accounting guidance issued to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of aoci. the registrants will be required to provide information about the effects on net income of significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by their respective statement of income line item, if the item is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety. for items not reclassified to net income in their entirety, the registrants will be required to reference other disclosures that provide details on these amounts. upon adoption, the enhanced disclosure requirements are not expected to have a significant impact on the registrants. 391 schedule i - lg&amp;e

the accompanying notes to condensed unconsolidated financial statements are an integral part of the financial statements. 394 schedule i - lg&amp;e and ku energy llc notes to condensed unconsolidated financial statements 1. basis of presentation lg&amp;e and ku energy llc (lke) is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its business operations through its subsidiaries. substantially all of its consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries. accordingly, its cash flow and its ability to meet its obligations are largely dependent upon the earnings of these subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings to it in the form of dividends or repayment of loans and advances from the subsidiaries. these condensed financial statements and related footnotes have been prepared in accordance with reg. 210.12-04 of regulation s-x. these statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of lke. lke indirectly or directly owns all of the ownership interests of its significant subsidiaries. lke relies primarily on dividends from its subsidiaries to fund lke's dividends to its member and to meet its other cash requirements. 2. commitments and contingencies see note 15 to lke's consolidated financial statements for commitments and contingencies of its subsidiaries. guarantees lke provides certain indemnifications, the most significant of which relate to the termination of the wke lease in july 2009. see note 9 to lke's consolidated financial statements for additional information. these guarantees cover the due and punctual payment, performance and discharge by each party of its respective present and future obligations. the most comprehensive of these guarantees is the lke guarantee covering operational, regulatory and environmental commitments and indemnifications made by wke under the wke transaction termination agreement. this guarantee has a term of 12 years ending july 2021, and a cumulative maximum exposure of $200 million. certain items such as government fines and penalties fall outside the cumulative cap. lke has contested the applicability of the indemnification requirement relating to one matter presented by a counterparty under this guarantee. another guarantee with a maximum exposure of $100 million covering other indemnifications expires in 2023. in may 2012, lke's indemnitee received an arbitration panel's decision affecting this matter, which granted lke's indemnitee certain rights of first refusal to purchase excess power at a market-based price rather than at an absolute fixed price. in january 2013, lke's indemnitee commenced a proceeding in the kentucky court of appeals appealing a december 2012 order of the henderson circuit court confirming the arbitration award. lke believes its indemnification obligations in this matter remain subject to various uncertainties, including the potential for additional legal challenges regarding the arbitration decision as well as future prices, availability and demand for the subject excess power. lke continues to evaluate various legal and commercial options with respect to this indemnification matter. the ultimate outcomes of the wke termination-related indemnifications cannot be predicted at this time. additionally, lke has indemnified various third parties related to historical obligations for other divested subsidiaries and affiliates. the indemnifications vary by entity and the maximum exposures range from being capped at the sale price to no specified maximum; however, lke is not aware of formal claims under such indemnities made by any party at this time. lke could be required to perform on these indemnifications in the event of covered losses or liabilities being claimed by an indemnified party. in the second quarter of 2012, lke adjusted its investments in subsidiaries for certain of these indemnifications by $9 million ($5 million after-tax), which is reflected in "equity in earnings of subsidiaries" on the statement of income. lke cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of such indemnification circumstances, but does not currently expect such outcomes to result in significant losses above the amounts recorded. 395 quarterly financial, common stock price and dividend data (unaudited) ppl corporation and subsidiaries

(ppl and ppl energy supply) in september 2013, ppl montana executed a definitive agreement to sell 633 mw of hydroelectric facilities to northwestern for $900 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. the sale, which is subject to certain regulatory approvals and not expected to close before the second half of 2014, includes 11 hydroelectric power facilities and related assets. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information on the sale and the related colstrip operating lease termination and subsequent purchase of the undivided interests in the colstrip units. 4 segment information (ppl) ppl is organized into four reportable segments as depicted in the chart above: u.k. regulated, kentucky regulated, pennsylvania regulated and supply. ppl's reportable segments primarily reflect the activities of its related subsidiary registrant(s), except that the reportable segments are also allocated certain corporate level financing and other costs that are not included in the results of the applicable subsidiary registrant(s). the u.k. regulated segment does not have a related subsidiary registrant. a comparison of ppl's three regulated segments is shown below: u.k. regulated ky regulated pa regulated for the year ended december 31, 2013: operating revenues (in billions) $2.4 $3.0 $1.9 net income attributable to ppl shareowners (in millions) $922 $307 $209 electric energy delivered (gwh) 78,219 31,088 36,760 at december 31, 2013: regulatory asset base (in billions) (a) $9.5 $7.6 $4.2 service area (in square miles) 21,400 9,400 10,000 end-users (in millions) 7.7 1.3 1.4 (a) represents rav for u.k. regulated, capitalization for ky regulated and rate base for pa regulated. see note 2 to the financial statements for additional financial information about the segments. (all registrants except ppl) ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku each operate within a single reportable segment. u.k. regulated segment (ppl) consists of ppl global which primarily includes wpd's regulated electricity distribution operations and certain costs, such as u.s. income taxes, administrative costs and allocated financing costs. wpd, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, operates four of the 15 regulated distribution networks providing electricity service in the u.k. with the april 2011 acquisition of wpd midlands, the number of end-users served by wpd has more than doubled, totaling 7.7 million across 21,400 square miles in wales and southwest and central england. see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information on the acquisition. details of revenue by category for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2013 2012 2011 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue utility revenues (a) $ 2,359 98 $ 2,289 98 $ 1,618 98 energy-related businesses 44 2 47 2 35 2 total $ 2,403 100 $ 2,336 100 $ 1,653 100 (a) amounts for 2011 are not comparable with 2012 or 2013 as wpd midlands was acquired in april 2011. 2011 includes eight months of activity as wpd midlands' results are recorded on a one-month lag. amounts for 2013 and 2012 are comparable as each period includes a full year of wpd midlands' results. wpd's energy-related business revenues include ancillary activities that support the distribution business, including telecommunication revenues from the rental of fiber optic cables primarily attached to wpd's overhead electricity distribution network, real estate and meter services to businesses across the u.k. franchise and licenses wpd is authorized by ofgem to provide electricity distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. for instance, wpd is subject to ofgem regulation with respect to the regulated revenue it can earn and the quality of service it must provide, and wpd can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service. 5 ofgem has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license. in january 2014, ofgem changed the licenses to include a reduction in customer bills to be recovered in subsequent periods. wpd is not currently aware of any further planned modification to any of its u.k. regulated businesses' distribution licenses that would result in a material adverse change to the u.k. regulated businesses. see "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview - distribution revenue reduction" for additional information. a failure by wpd to comply with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by ofgem. ofgem has the power to levy fines of up to 10% of revenue for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may be revoked. unless terminated in the circumstances mentioned above, a distribution license continues indefinitely until revoked by ofgem following no less than 25 years' written notice. competition although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. wpd's four distribution businesses, wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (west midlands) and wpd (east midlands) are, therefore, regulated monopolies which operate under regulatory price controls. revenue and regulation the operations of wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands) are regulated by ofgem under the direction of the gas and electricity markets authority. the electricity act 1989 provides the fundamental framework of electricity companies and established licenses that required each of the dnos to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. ofgem has established a price control mechanism that provides the amount of revenue that a regulated business can earn and provides for an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for exceeding or underperforming relative to pre-established targets. this regulatory structure is an incentive-based structure in contrast to the typical u.s. regulatory structure which operates on a cost-recovery based model. under the uk regulatory structure, electricity distribution revenues are currently set every five years, but will be extended to eight years in the next price control period beginning in april 2015. the revenue that dnos can earn in each price control period is the sum of: i) the regulator's determination of efficient operating costs, ii) a return on capital from rav plus an annual adjustment for inflation as determined by retail price index (rpi) for the prior year, iii) a return of capital from rav (i.e. depreciation), and iv) certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control. additionally, incentives are provided for a range of activities including exceeding certain reliability and customer service targets. wpd is currently operating under dpcr5 which is effective for the period from april 1, 2010 through march 31, 2015. ofgem allowed an average increase in total revenues, before inflationary adjustments in each of the five years of dpcr5 of 6.9% for wpd (south west) and wpd (south wales) and 4.5% for wpd midlands. the revenue increases include reimbursement for higher operating and capital costs that would be incurred from additional regulatory requirements. in dpcr5, ofgem decoupled wpd's allowed revenue from volume delivered over the five-year price control period. however, in any fiscal period, wpd's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular period. under-recovered amounts are recovered in the next regulatory year. in addition to providing a base regulated revenue allowance, ofgem has established incentive mechanisms to provide significant opportunities to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. some of the more significant incentive mechanisms under dpcr5 include: interruptions incentive scheme (iis) - this incentive has two major components: 1) customer interruptions and 2) customer minutes lost, and both are designed to incentivize the dnos to invest and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages. the target for each dno is based on a benchmark of data from the last four years of the prior price control period. effective april 1, 2012, an additional customer satisfaction incentive mechanism was implemented that includes a customer satisfaction survey, a complaints metric and a measure of stakeholder engagement. this incentive replaced the customer response telephone performance incentive that was effective april 1, 2010. 6 information quality incentive (iqi) - the iqi is designed to incentivize the dnos to provide good quality information in the business plans they submit to ofgem during the price control review process and to execute the plan as submitted. the iqi eliminates the distinction between capital expenditure and operating expense and instead focuses on total expenditure. total expenditure is allocated 85% to rav and currently recovered over 20 years through the regulatory depreciation of rav and 15% to certain expenses which is recovered during the current price control review period, and includes all corporate and non-network capital expenditures. the iqi provides for incentives or penalties at the end of dpcr5 based on the ratio of actual expenditures to the expenditures submitted to ofgem that were the basis for the revenues allowed for the five-year price control period. at the beginning of dpcr5, wpd was awarded $301 million in iqi revenue of which $222 million will be included in revenue throughout the current price control period with the balance recovered over subsequent price control periods. the following table shows the amount of further incentive revenue, primarily from iis, that wpd has earned since the beginning of dpcr5: incentive earned regulatory year ended incentive regulatory year ended (in millions) included in revenue march 2011 $ 30 march 2013 march 2012 83 march 2014 march 2013 104 march 2015 in october 2010, ofgem announced changes to the regulatory framework that will be effective for the u.k. electricity distribution sector, including wpd, beginning april 2015. the framework, known as riio (revenues = incentives + innovation + outputs), is intended to: encourage dnos to deliver safe, reliable and sustainable network service at long-term value to customers; enable dnos to finance the required investment in a timely and efficient way; and remunerate dnos according to their delivery for customers. ofgem published a strategy decision document in march 2013 providing the policies that will apply in riio-ed1. key components included: an extension of the price review period to eight years; increased emphasis on outputs and incentives; enhanced stakeholder engagement including network customers; a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation; replacement of the current low carbon network fund to continue to stimulate innovation; capital return comprised of a 10 year trailing average debt allowance and an equity allowance to be determined by ofgem with a debt to equity ratio of 65:35; and depreciation of rav for additions after april 1, 2015 will be extended from 20 years to 45 years, although transitional arrangements will be considered by ofgem. in july 2013, wpd filed its business plans with ofgem for its four dnos for riio-ed1. in november 2013, ofgem determined that the 8-year business plans of all four of wpd's dnos were suitable for accelerated consideration or "fast tracking" and as a result, subject to a final ofgem determination, merit early settlement of their price controls for the 8-year period starting april 1, 2015. fast tracking affords several benefits to the wpd dnos, including the ability to collect additional revenue equivalent to 2.5% of total annual expenditures during the 8-year price control period (approximately $35 million annually), greater revenue certainty and a higher level of cost savings retention. in february 2014, ofgem announced its decision on the consultation related to the cost of equity to be used during the riio-ed1 period. the resulting real cost of equity for wpd was 6.4%, compared to 6.7% proposed in wpd's business plan submittals. wpd elected to accept this change and remain in the fast-track process. the change in the cost of equity is not expected to have a significant impact on the results of operations for ppl. ofgem expects to announce its fast track final determination in late february 2014. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to u.k. regulated segment" for additional information on the risks associated with riio-ed1. 7 customers the majority of wpd's revenue is known as duos and is derived from charging energy suppliers for the delivery of electricity to end-users. therefore, wpd's customers are energy suppliers. ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the distribution connection and use of system agreement. this agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to collateralize for its payment obligations. kentucky regulated segment (ppl) consists of the operations of lke, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of lg&amp;e and ku. in addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the kentucky regulated segment. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lke became a wholly owned subsidiary of ppl on november 1, 2010. lg&amp;e and ku are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky and, in ku's case, virginia and tennessee. lg&amp;e also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. lg&amp;e provides electric service to approximately 397,000 customers in louisville and adjacent areas in kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 321,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in kentucky. ku provides electric service to approximately 514,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western kentucky, approximately 29,000 customers in five counties in southwestern virginia, and fewer than ten customers in tennessee, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. ku also sells wholesale electricity to 12 municipalities in kentucky under load following contracts. in virginia, ku operates under the name old dominion power company. details of operating revenues by customer class for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2013 2012 2011 % of % of % of revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue lke commercial $ 770 26 $ 723 26 $ 719 26 industrial 587 20 551 20 533 19 residential 1,205 40 1,071 39 1,087 39 retail - other 260 9 270 10 269 9 wholesale - municipal 110 4 102 4 104 4 wholesale - other (a) 44 1 42 1 81 3 total $ 2,976 100 $ 2,759 100 $ 2,793 100 lg&amp;e commercial $ 405 29 $ 374 28 $ 372 27 industrial 186 13 170 13 152 11 residential 614 44 548 41 561 41 retail - other 119 8 131 10 130 10 wholesale - other (a) (b) 86 6 101 8 149 11 total $ 1,410 100 $ 1,324 100 $ 1,364 100 ku commercial $ 365 22 $ 349 23 $ 347 22 industrial 401 25 381 25 381 25 residential 591 36 523 34 526 34 retail - other 141 9 139 9 139 9 wholesale - municipal 110 7 102 7 104 7 wholesale - other (a) (b) 27 1 30 2 51 3 total $ 1,635 100 $ 1,524 100 $ 1,548 100 (a) includes wholesale power and transmission revenues. (b) includes intercompany power sales and transmission revenues, which are eliminated upon consolidation at lke. 8 franchises and licenses lg&amp;e and ku provide electricity delivery service, and lg&amp;e provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. competition there are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of lke. from time to time, bills are introduced into the kentucky general assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. neither the kentucky general assembly nor the kpsc has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in kentucky. the nature or timing of any legislative or regulatory actions regarding industry restructuring and their impact on lke, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. ku's operations in virginia have been and remain regulated. alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels provide indirect competition for natural gas revenues of lke. marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. lg&amp;e's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity; therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact profitability. however, some large industrial and commercial customers may physically bypass lg&amp;e's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems. power supply at december 31, 2013, lke owned, controlled or had a minority ownership interest in generating capacity (summer rating) of 8,079 mw, of which 3,340 mw related to lg&amp;e and 4,739 mw related to ku, in kentucky, indiana, and ohio. see "item 2. properties - kentucky regulated segment" for a complete list of lke's generating facilities. the system capacity of lke's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances. during 2013, lke's kentucky power plants generated the following amounts of electricity. gwh fuel source lke lg&amp;e ku coal (a) 34,336 14,568 19,768 oil / gas 503 176 327 hydro 300 193 107 total (b) 35,139 14,937 20,202 (a) includes 854 gwh of power generated by and purchased from ovec for lke, 591 gwh for lg&amp;e and 263 gwh for ku. (b) this generation represents a 2.1% increase for lke, a 5% decrease for lg&amp;e and a 8.1% increase for ku from 2012 output. a significant portion of lg&amp;e's and ku's generated electricity was used to supply its retail and municipal customer base. lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail and municipal customers. when lg&amp;e has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of ku, ku purchases electricity from lg&amp;e. when ku has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail and municipal customers and its generation cost is lower than that of lg&amp;e, lg&amp;e purchases electricity from ku. see "item 2. properties - kentucky regulated segment" for additional information regarding lg&amp;e's and ku's cane run unit 7 which is currently under construction. in january 2014, lg&amp;e and ku filed an application for a cpcn with the kpsc requesting approval to construct a ngcc generating unit at ku's green river generating site (green river unit 5) and a solar generating facility at the e. w. brown generating site. as a result of environmental requirements, lg&amp;e and ku anticipate retiring five older coal-fired electric generating units at the cane run and green river plants, which have a combined summer capacity rating of 724 mw. in addition, ku retired a 12 mw unit at the haefling plant in december 2013 and the remaining 71 mw unit at the tyrone plant in february 2013. 9 fuel supply coal is expected to be the predominant fuel used by lg&amp;e and ku for baseload generation for the foreseeable future. however, natural gas will play a more significant role starting in 2015 when cane run unit 7 is expected to be placed into operation, and in 2018 when the ngcc generating unit at green river generating site is expected to be placed into operation. these units are expected to be used for baseload generation. the natural gas for these generating units will be contracted from suppliers separately from lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. natural gas and oil will continue to be used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. to enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, lg&amp;e and ku have secured long-term pipeline capacity on the interstate pipeline serving the new ngcc unit at cane run and six simple cycle combustion turbine units. lg&amp;e and ku have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2017 and normally augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. for their existing units, lg&amp;e and ku expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western kentucky, southern indiana and southern illinois. in 2014 and beyond, lg&amp;e and ku may purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from wyoming for blending at tc2. coal is delivered to the generating plants by barge, truck and rail. (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) natural gas distribution supply five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 bcf, are used in providing natural gas service to lg&amp;e's firm sales customers. by using natural gas storage facilities, lg&amp;e avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads. natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. without this storage capacity, lg&amp;e would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are typically at their highest. several suppliers under contracts of varying duration provide competitively priced natural gas. at december 31, 2013, lg&amp;e had 12 bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $48 million. lg&amp;e has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying terms with a number of suppliers designed to meet its firm sales obligations. these natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. in tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. lg&amp;e purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. lg&amp;e has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by lg&amp;e between 2015 and 2018. total winter capacity under these contracts is 194,900 mmbtu/day and summer capacity is 88,000 mmbtu/day. lg&amp;e has a contract with another pipeline that expires in october 2018. total winter and summer capacity under this contract is 20,000 mmbtu/day during both seasons. lg&amp;e expects to purchase most of its natural gas distribution supplies from onshore producing regions in south texas, east texas, north louisiana, and arkansas, as well as gas delivered to its pipeline transporters in ohio. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) rates and regulation lg&amp;e is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc and the ferc, and ku is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc, the ferc, the vscc and the tra. lg&amp;e and ku operate under a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff. lg&amp;e and ku contract with the tennessee valley authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator. lg&amp;e and ku contract with transerv international, inc. to act as their independent transmission operator. 10 in february 2013, lg&amp;e and ku submitted a compliance filing to the ferc reflecting their participation with other utilities in the southeastern regional transmission planning relating to certain ferc order 1000 requirements. ferc order 1000, issued in july 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electric transmission planning activities. lg&amp;e's and ku's kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. as such, lg&amp;e and ku generally earn a return on regulatory assets. ku's virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of virginia base rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. ku's rates to municipal customers for wholesale requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a rate formula that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms. rate cases see "regulatory matters - kentucky activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for information on rate cases. pennsylvania regulated segment (ppl) includes the regulated electricity delivery operations of ppl electric. in addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the pennsylvania regulated segment. (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the puc, and certain of its transmission activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the federal power act. ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central pennsylvania. ppl electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers in this area as a plr under the customer choice act. details of revenues by customer class for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2013 2012 2011 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue distribution residential $ 1,215 65 $ 1,108 63 $ 1,266 67 industrial 52 3 53 3 62 3 commercial 363 19 366 21 431 23 other (a) (b) (11) 26 1 (47) (3) transmission 251 13 210 12 180 10 total $ 1,870 100 $ 1,763 100 $ 1,892 100 (a) includes regulatory over- or under-recovery reconciliation mechanisms, pole attachment revenues, and street lighting. (b) included in these amounts for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are $4 million, $3 million and $11 million of retail and wholesale electric to affiliate revenue which is eliminated in consolidation for ppl. franchise, licenses and other regulations ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. 11 competition pursuant to authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. pursuant to the customer choice act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in pennsylvania. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. rates and regulation transmission ppl electric's transmission facilities are within pjm, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. pjm serves as a ferc-approved rto to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. in addition to operating the electricity transmission network, pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary objective of any rto is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the rto directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. as a transmission owner, ppl electric's transmission revenues are recovered through pjm in accordance with a ferc approved tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula rate mechanism. as a plr, ppl electric also purchases transmission services from pjm. see "plr" below. in july 2011, ferc issued a final rule on order 1000 directing that transmission providers such as pjm, remove from ferc approved tariffs, any provision that grants federal right of first refusal for facilities selected in a regional transmission plan and requiring subsequent compliance filings. pjm tariff changes are currently under review by the ferc. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on rate mechanisms. distribution ppl electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the puc. currently, ppl electric's smart meter rider is the only regulatory asset earning a return. certain operating expenses are also included in ppl electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and taxes. pennsylvania's aeps requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania from alternative energy sources. under the default service procurement plans approved by the puc, ppl electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the aeps. act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new plr generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct, and changes to the existing aeps. act 11 authorizes the puc to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a dsic. such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to ppl electric as it begins a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system. in january 2013, ppl electric filed a petition requesting permission to establish a dsic. in may 2013, the puc approved ppl electric's proposed dsic with an initial rate effective july 1, 2013, subject to refund after hearings. the puc also assigned four technical recovery calculation issues to the office of administrative law judge for hearing and preparation of a recommended decision. the case remains pending before the puc. 12 see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129, act 11 and other legislative and regulatory impacts. plr the customer choice act requires electric distribution companies (edcs), including ppl electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the puc to act as a plr of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the plr pursuant to regulations established by the puc. as of december 31, 2013, the following percentages of ppl electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 51% of residential, 84% of small commercial and industrial and 99% of large commercial and industrial customers. the puc continues to be interested in expanding the competitive market for electricity. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. ppl electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period june 2013 through may 2015, which includes 4 solicitations for electricity supply held in april and october, annually. pursuant to this plan, ppl electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, large commercial and large industrial customers who elect to take that service from ppl electric. these solicitations include a mix of 12- and 9-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, and 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and large industrial customers to fulfill ppl electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a plr. numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in ppl electric's service territory. whether its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers or from ppl electric as a plr, the purchase of such supply has no impact on the financial results of ppl electric. the costs to purchase plr supply, including charges paid to pjm for related transmission services, are passed directly by ppl electric to its plr customers without markup. see "energy purchase commitments" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding ppl electric's solicitations. rate cases see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on rate cases and the proposed storm damage expense rider. supply segment (ppl) consists primarily of the activities of ppl energy supply's subsidiaries, ppl generation and ppl energyplus. ppl generation owns and operates competitive domestic power plants to generate electricity and acquires and develops competitive domestic generation projects. ppl energyplus markets and trades electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related products in competitive wholesale and retail markets. in addition, certain financing and other costs are allocated to the supply segment. (ppl and ppl energy supply) ppl energy supply's generation assets are located in the northeastern and northwestern u.s. markets. the northeastern generating capacity is located primarily in pennsylvania within pjm and northwestern generating capacity is located in montana. ppl energy supply enters into energy and energy-related contracts to hedge the variability of expected cash flows associated with its generating units and marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes. ppl energyplus sells the electricity produced by ppl energy supply's generation plants based on prevailing market rates. ppl energy supply's total expected generation in 2014 is anticipated to be used to meet its committed contractual sales. ppl energy supply has also entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for 2015 and beyond. 13 details of revenue by category for the years ended december 31, are shown below. 2013 2012 2011 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue energy unregulated wholesale energy (a) $ 3,095 67 $ 4,204 76 $ 5,238 82 unregulated retail energy 1,031 22 848 16 727 11 total energy 4,126 89 5,052 92 5,965 93 energy-related businesses (b) 527 11 448 8 464 7 total $ 4,653 100 $ 5,500 100 $ 6,429 100 (a) included in these amounts for 2013, 2012, and 2011 are $51 million, $78 million and $26 million of wholesale electricity sales to an affiliate, ppl electric, which are eliminated in consolidation for ppl. (b) energy-related businesses primarily support the generation, marketing and trading businesses of ppl energy supply. their activities include developing renewable energy projects and providing energy-related products and services to commercial and industrial customers through their mechanical contracting and services subsidiaries. energy-related businesses for ppl's supply segment had additional revenues not related to ppl energy supply of $13 million and $8 million for 2012 and 2011, which are not included in this table. power supply ppl energy supply owned or controlled generating capacity (summer rating) of 10,678 mw at december 31, 2013. generating capacity controlled by ppl generation and other ppl energy supply subsidiaries includes power obtained through ppl energyplus' power purchase agreements. see "item 2. properties - supply segment" for details of ppl energy supply's generating capacity. during 2013, ppl energy supply owned or controlled power plants that generated the following amounts of electricity. gwh fuel source northeastern northwestern total nuclear 17,018 17,018 oil / gas 9,516 9,516 coal 17,150 4,409 21,559 hydro 662 3,252 3,914 renewables (a) 348 348 total 44,694 7,661 52,355 (a) ppl energy supply subsidiaries own or control renewable energy projects located in pennsylvania, new jersey, vermont and new hampshire with a generating capacity (summer rating) of 42 mw. ppl energyplus sells the energy, capacity and recs produced by these plants into the wholesale market as well as to commercial and industrial customers. ppl energy supply's generation subsidiaries are ewgs that sell electricity into wholesale markets. ewgs are subject to regulation by the ferc, which has authorized these ewgs to sell the electricity generated at market-based prices. this electricity is sold to ppl energyplus under ferc-jurisdictional power purchase agreements. ppl susquehanna is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of the susquehanna nuclear units. certain of ppl energy supply's other subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of their fossil plants with respect to certain level and density monitoring devices. certain operations of ppl generation's subsidiaries are also subject to osha and comparable state statutes. see note 9 to the financial statements for information on the 2011 sale of certain non-core generation facilities. fuel supply coal pennsylvania ppl energyplus actively manages ppl energy supply's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in northern appalachia. 14 during 2013, ppl generation purchased 5.7 million tons of coal required for its wholly owned pennsylvania plants. coal inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, has agreements in place that will provide more than 17 million tons of ppl generation's projected coal needs for the pennsylvania power plants from 2014 through 2018 and augments its coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. a ppl generation subsidiary owns a 12.34% interest in the keystone plant and a 16.25% interest in the conemaugh plant. ppl generation owns a 12.34% interest in keystone fuels, llc and a 16.25% interest in conemaugh fuels, llc. the keystone plant contracts with keystone fuels, llc for its coal requirements, which provided 4.2 million tons of coal to the keystone plant in 2013. the conemaugh plant requirements are purchased under contract from conemaugh fuels, llc, which provided 4.3 million tons of coal to the conemaugh plant in 2013. all wholly owned ppl generation coal plants within pennsylvania are equipped with scrubbers, which use limestone in their operations. acting as agent for ppl generation, ppl energyplus has entered into limestone contracts with suppliers that will provide for those plants' requirements through 2014. during 2013, 405,000 tons of limestone were delivered to brunner island and montour under these contracts. annual limestone requirements range from approximately 400,000-500,000 tons. montana ppl montana owns a 30% interest in colstrip unit 3 and northwestern owns a 30% interest in colstrip unit 4. ppl montana and northwestern have a sharing agreement that governs each party's responsibilities and rights relating to the operation of colstrip units 3 and 4. under the terms of that agreement, each party is responsible for 15% of the total non-coal operating and construction costs of colstrip units 3 and 4, regardless of whether a particular cost is specific to colstrip unit 3 or 4 and is entitled to take up to 15% of the available generation from units 3 and 4. each party is responsible for its own coal costs. ppl montana, with the other colstrip owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined coal quality characteristics and specifications. ppl montana, with the other colstrip units 1 and 2 owner, has a long-term purchase and supply agreement with the current supplier for units 1 and 2, which provides these units 100% of their coal requirements through december 2014, and at least 85% of such requirements from january 2015 through december 2019. ppl montana, with the other colstrip units 3 and 4 owners, has a long-term coal supply contract for units 3 and 4, which provides these units 100% of their coal requirements through december 2019. these units were originally built with scrubbers and ppl montana has entered into a long-term contract to purchase the limestone requirements for these units. the contract extends through december 2030. coal supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality characteristics and specifications for ppl montana's corette plant. the contracts covered 100% of the plant's coal requirements in 2013 and similar contracts are in place to supply 100% of the expected coal requirements through 2014. in the third quarter of 2012, ppl energy supply announced its intention, beginning in april 2015, to place its corette plant in long-term reserve status, suspending the plant's operation due to expected market conditions and the costs to comply with mats. oil and natural gas pennsylvania ppl generation's martins creek units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas. during 2013, 100% of the physical gas requirements for the martins creek units were purchased on the spot market and oil requirements were supplied from inventory. at december 31, 2013, there were no long-term agreements for oil or natural gas for these units. short-term and long-term gas transportation contracts are in place for approximately 38% of the maximum daily requirements of the lower mt. bethel combined-cycle facility. during 2013, 100% of the physical gas requirements were purchased on the spot market. for ppl's ironwood facility, ppl energyplus has long-term transportation contracts that can deliver up to approximately 25% of ironwood's maximum daily gas requirements. daily gas requirements can also be met through a combination of short-term transportation capacity release transactions coupled with upstream supply. ppl energyplus currently has no long-term physical gas contracts for this facility. during 2013, 100% of the physical gas requirements were purchased on the spot market. 15 nuclear the nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. ppl susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services. these contracts are expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of 2018 and unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2019. ppl susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued operation of the nuclear units. federal law requires the u.s. government to provide for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel, but there is no definitive date by which a repository will be operational. as a result, it was necessary to expand susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity. to support this expansion, ppl susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage technology. the facility is modular, so that additional storage capacity can be added as needed. the facility began receiving spent nuclear fuel in 1999. ppl susquehanna estimates, under current operating conditions, that there is sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approximately 2017. if necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be discharged through the current licensed life of the plant. in 1996, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled that the nuclear waste policy act imposed on the doe an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel on or before january 31, 1998. in january 2004, ppl susquehanna filed suit in the u.s. court of federal claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the doe's breach of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel. in may 2011, ppl susquehanna entered into a settlement agreement with the u.s. government relating to ppl susquehanna's lawsuit, seeking damages for the department of energy's failure to accept spent nuclear fuel from the ppl susquehanna plant. ppl susquehanna recorded credits totaling $56 million to "fuel" on the statement of income in 2011 to recognize recovery, under the settlement agreement, of certain costs to store spent nuclear fuel at the susquehanna plant. the amounts recorded through september 2011 cover costs incurred from 1998 through december 2010. ppl susquehanna is eligible to receive payment of annual claims for allowed costs, as set forth in the settlement agreement, that are incurred through december 31, 2013. in exchange, ppl susquehanna has waived any claims against the united states government for costs paid or injuries sustained related to storing spent nuclear fuel at the susquehanna plant through december 31, 2013. in january 2014, ppl susquehanna entered into a new agreement with the department of energy to extend the settlement agreement on the same terms as the prior agreement for an additional three years to the end of 2016. energy marketing ppl energyplus sells the capacity and electricity produced by ppl generation subsidiaries, and buys and sells purchased power, capacity, ancillary services, ftrs, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances and recs in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets. ppl energyplus transacts in competitive retail energy markets, and buys and sells electricity and natural gas supply, to meet the diverse needs of business customers. ppl energyplus sells retail electricity supply to business customers in delaware, the district of columbia, maryland, montana, new jersey, ohio and pennsylvania and sells retail natural gas supply to business customers in delaware, maryland, new jersey, and pennsylvania. the company also offers electricity supply to select residential customers in pennsylvania. an affiliate of ppl energyplus sells petroleum products to wholesalers and distributors in delaware, maryland, new jersey, pennsylvania and virginia. although retail energy revenues continue to grow, the net margins related to these activities are not currently a significant component of ppl energy supply's margins. within the constraints of its hedging policy, ppl energyplus actively manages its portfolios of energy and energy-related products to optimize their value and to limit exposure to price fluctuations. see note 19 to the financial statements for more information. competition since the early 1990s, there has been increased competition in u.s. energy markets because of federal and state competitive market initiatives. although some states, such as pennsylvania and montana, have created a competitive market for electricity generation, other states continue to consider different types of regulatory initiatives concerning competition in the 16 power and gas industries. some states that were considering creating competitive markets have slowed their plans or postponed further consideration. in addition, states that have created competitive markets have, from time to time, considered new market rules and re-regulation measures that could result in more limited opportunities for competitive energy suppliers. interest in re-regulation, however, has slowed due to recent declining power prices. as such, the markets in which ppl energy supply participates are highly competitive. ppl energy supply faces competition in wholesale markets for available energy, capacity and ancillary services. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, congestion along the power grid, subsidies provided by state and federal governments for new generation facilities, new market entrants, construction of new generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. ppl energy supply primarily competes with other electricity suppliers based on its ability to aggregate generation supply at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. competitors in wholesale power markets include regulated utilities, industrial companies, nugs, competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy marketers. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to supply segment", "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview" and notes 15 and 19 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks faced with respect to competitive energy markets. franchise and licenses see "energy marketing" above for a discussion of ppl energyplus' licenses in various states. ppl energyplus also has an export license from the doe to sell capacity and/or energy to electric utilities in canada. ppl susquehanna operates units 1 and 2 pursuant to nrc operating licenses that expire in 2042 for unit 1 and in 2044 for unit 2. in 2008, a ppl energy supply subsidiary, ppl bell bend, llc, submitted a cola to the nrc for a new nuclear generating unit (bell bend) to be built adjacent to the susquehanna plant. also in 2008, the cola was formally docketed and accepted for review by the nrc. ppl bell bend, llc does not expect to complete the cola review process with the nrc prior to 2016. see note 8 to financial statements for additional information. ppl holtwood operates the holtwood hydroelectric generating plant pursuant to a ferc-granted license that expires in 2030. in 2013, a 125 mw expansion project was placed in service. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. ppl holtwood operates the wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating plant pursuant to a ferc-granted license that expires in 2044. ppl montana's 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir in montana are licensed by the ferc. the thompson falls and kerr licenses expire in 2025 and 2035, the licenses for the nine missouri-madison facilities expire in 2040, and the license for the mystic facility expires in 2050. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information on the september 2013 agreement for the sale of the montana hydroelectric facilities. also see note 11 for information on a pending arbitration related to the conveyance price for the kerr dam. in connection with the relicensing of these generating facilities, applicable law permits the ferc to relicense the original licensee or license a new licensee or allow the u.s. government to take over the facility. if the original licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on the kerr dam license. other corporate functions (ppl) ppl services provides corporate functions such as financial, legal, supply chain, human resources and information technology services. most of ppl services' costs are charged directly to the respective ppl subsidiaries for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable subsidiaries based on an average of the subsidiaries' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees. ppl capital funding, ppl's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of ppl and certain subsidiaries. ppl's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through ppl capital funding, that further enables ppl to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of ppl's rated companies. as a result, ppl plans to further utilize ppl capital funding in future financings, in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies. 17 unlike ppl services, ppl capital funding's costs are not generally charged to any ppl subsidiaries. costs are charged directly to ppl. however, ppl capital funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of lke and wpd midlands and certain associated financing costs were charged directly to the kentucky and u.k. regulated segments. the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other ppl capital funding securities, have been and will continue to be assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of ppl management's assessment of segment performance. the financing costs associated primarily with ppl capital funding's securities issuances in 2013 and beyond, with certain exceptions including the remarketing of the debt component of the equity units, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment. (all registrants) seasonality the demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. as a result, the registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or extreme winter weather make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned, the retail load served and the terms of contracts to purchase or sell electricity. see "financial condition - environmental matters" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for additional information regarding climate change. financial condition see "financial condition" in item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for this information. capital expenditure requirements see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for 2014 through 2018. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures from environmental matters. environmental matters the registrants are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. the epa is in the process of proposing and finalizing an unprecedented number of environmental regulations that will directly affect the electricity industry. these initiatives cover air, water and waste. see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" on projected environmental capital expenditures for the years 2014-2018. also, see "environmental matters" in note 15 to the financial statements for additional information. to comply with primarily air-related environmental requirements, ppl's forecast for environmental capital expenditures reflects a best estimate projection of expenditures that may be required within the next five years. such projections are $2.4 billion for ppl, including $2.2 billion for lke ($1.1 billion each for lg&amp;e and ku), and $279 million for ppl energy supply. actual costs (including capital, emission allowance purchases and operational modifications) may be significantly lower or higher depending on the final compliance requirements and market conditions. ppl's and lke's subsidiaries may also incur capital expenditures and operating expenses, which are not now determinable, but could be significant. most environmental compliance costs incurred by lg&amp;e and ku are subject to recovery through a rate recovery mechanism. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. 18 employee relations at december 31, 2013, ppl and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees. ppl energy supply (a) 4,912 ppl electric 2,239 lke ku 945 lg&amp;e 999 lks 1,446 total lke 3,390 ppl global (primarily wpd) 6,309 ppl services and other 1,258 total ppl 18,108 (a) includes labor union employees of mechanical contracting subsidiaries, whose numbers tend to fluctuate due to the nature of this business. at december 31, 2013, the breakdown of the total workforce that is represented by labor unions was: number of employees percent of total workforce ppl 9,713 54% ppl energy supply 3,063 62% ppl electric 1,419 63% lke 843 25% lg&amp;e 701 70% ku 142 15% there are 4,016 employees of wpd who are members of labor unions (or 64% of ppl's u.k. workforce). wpd recognizes four unions, the largest of which represents 40% of its union workforce. wpd's electricity business agreement, which covers 3,941 union employees, may be amended by agreement between wpd and the unions and can be terminated with 12 months' notice by either side. available information ppl's internet website is www.pplweb.com. under the investor heading of that website, ppl provides access to all sec filings of the registrants (including annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(d) or 15(d)) free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec. additionally, the registrants' filings are available at the sec's

associated with their businesses. our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. in addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 15 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. as used in this item 1a., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to ppl energy supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the supply segment discussions, or ppl electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania regulated segment discussion, or lke and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the kentucky regulated segment discussion. risks related to all segments ( all registrants ) we plan to selectively pursue growth of transmission and distribution capacity, and to optimize our merchant and regulated generation operations, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. we plan to pursue expansion of our transmission and distribution capacity over the next several years and to optimize our merchant and regulated generation operations. we plan to do this through the potential construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure, and power uprates at certain of our existing power plants, the construction of new power plants or modification of existing power plants, and the potential closure of certain existing plants. these types of projects involve numerous risks. any planned power uprates could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs. with respect to the construction of new plants or modification of existing plants, or the construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. expansion in our regulated businesses is dependent on future load or service requirements and subject to applicable regulatory processes. the success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory operating contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals. if we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project. furthermore, we might be unable to operate any new or modified plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings. adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. declines in wholesale energy prices, partially resulting from adverse economic conditions, have significantly impacted our earnings. the breadth and depth of these negative economic conditions had a wide-ranging impact on the u.s. and u.k. business environment, including our businesses, and demand for energy commodities has declined significantly. this reduced demand continues to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets we serve (such as pjm) and our pennsylvania and kentucky utility businesses. the combination of lower demand for power and increased supply of natural gas has put downward price pressure on wholesale energy markets in general, further impacting our energy marketing results. in general, economic and commodity market conditions will continue to challenge predictability regarding our unhedged future energy margins, utility profits, liquidity and overall financial condition. disruption in financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and capital, among other things, for capital expenditures and providing collateral to support hedging in our energy marketing business. regulations being implemented under the dodd-frank act and basel iii in europe may impose costly additional requirements on our businesses and the businesses of others with whom we contract, such as banks or other counterparties, or simply result in increased costs to conduct our business or access sources of capital and liquidity upon which the conduct of our businesses is dependent. 20 we could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our bond credit ratings, adverse credit market conditions or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets. in the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt service and operating needs. as a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rates; credit rating considerations; insurance, security or collateral requirements; market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased availability of credit. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. credit ratings assigned by moody's, fitch and s&amp;p to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. a ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund liquidity needs and access new long-term debt at acceptable interest rates. see "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - ratings triggers" for additional information on the financial impact of a downgrade in our credit ratings. our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of extreme weather conditions. our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold, unseasonably mild weather or severe storms occur. the patterns of these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity. operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters. weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs. storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues and increase expenses, due to reduced usage and restoration costs. the operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risk. numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. the operation of our generation plants, including the susquehanna nuclear plant, and of our energy and fuel trading businesses, as well as our transmission and distribution operations are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive actions, principally by terrorists or vandals, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. as a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages and costs to replace or repair damaged equipment. our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change. climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electricity. these or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electricity, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies. reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered should consumers' preferences or market factors move toward favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage. 21 we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "federal matters" in note 6 and "legal matters," "regulatory issues" and "environmental matters - domestic" in note 15 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting and reducing our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. we provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, inflation rates, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. we may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings. under gaap, we are required to test our recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. although no goodwill impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2013, we are unable to predict whether future impairment charges may be necessary. we also review our long-lived assets, including equity investments, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. see notes 1, 9 and 18 to the financial statements for additional information on impairment charges taken and analysis performed during the reporting periods. we are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future years. we may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations. in connection with various divestitures, and certain other transactions, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities. these indemnities and guarantees relate, among other things, to liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated a divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture. see "guarantees and other assurances" in note 15 to the financial statements. we are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution operations. the conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties. our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses and decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial performance. 22 operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. these events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently and lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance costs which may not be recoverable from customers. planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us fully in the event losses occur. we are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations. changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations. we are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, property, gross receipts and franchise, sales and use, employment-related and other taxes. we also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits. due to the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered. we cannot predict whether such tax legislation or regulation will be introduced or enacted or the effect of any such changes on our businesses. if enacted, any changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we are subject to the risk that our workforce and its knowledge base may become depleted in coming years. ppl is experiencing an increase in attrition due primarily to the number of retiring employees. over the period from 2014 through 2018, 23.5% of ppl's total workforce is projected to leave the company, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed personnel due to a declining trend in the number of available skilled workers and an increase in competition for such workers. (ppl, ppl energy supply and lke) risk related to registrant holding companies ppl's, ppl energy supply's and lke's cash flows and ability to meet their obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and ppl's ability to pay dividends, largely depends on the financial performance of their subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries. ppl, ppl energy supply and lke are holding companies and conduct their operations primarily through subsidiaries. substantially all of the consolidated assets of these registrants are held by such subsidiaries. accordingly, their cash flows and ability to meet debt and guaranty obligations, as well as ppl's ability to pay dividends, are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or advances or repayment of loans and advances. the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends or distributions to their parents or to make funds available for such a payment. the ability of the registrants' subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions in the future will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory requirements, including restrictions on the ability of ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku to pay dividends under section 305(a) of the federal power act. because ppl, ppl energy supply and lke are holding companies, their debt and guaranty obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of their subsidiaries. although certain agreements to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, ppl, ppl energy supply and lke and their subsidiaries retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities. therefore, ppl's, ppl energy supply's and lke's rights and the rights of their creditors, including rights of any debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of their subsidiaries, in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors. in addition, if ppl elects to receive distributions of earnings from its foreign operations, ppl may incur u.s. income taxes, net of any available foreign tax credits, on such amounts. 23 ( ppl ) risks related to u.k. regulated segment our u.k. delivery business is subject to risks with respect to rate regulation and operational performance. our u.k. delivery businesses are rate-regulated and operate under an incentive-based regulatory framework. managing operational risk is critical to the u.k. regulated segment's financial performance. disruption to these distribution networks could reduce profitability both directly by incurring costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that ofgem administers relating to customer service levels. a failure by any of our u.k. regulated businesses to comply with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by ofgem that could have an adverse impact on ppl. ofgem has powers to levy fines of up to ten percent of revenue for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may be revoked. ofgem also has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license and there can be no assurance that a restrictive modification will not be introduced in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the u.k. regulated businesses and ppl. various changes have been implemented by ofgem to the current electricity distribution, gas transmission and gas distribution regulatory frameworks in the u.k. and there can be no assurance as to the effects such changes will have on our u.k. regulated businesses in the future. ofgem is implementing a new regulatory framework to become effective april 1, 2015 for the electricity distribution sector in the u.k. the framework, known as riio (revenues = incentives + innovation + outputs), focuses on sustainability, environmental-focused output measures, promotion of low carbon energy networks and financing of new investments. the new regulatory framework is expected to have a wide-ranging effect on electricity distribution companies operating in the u.k., including extending the price review periods from five to eight years. our u.k. regulated businesses' compliance with this new regulatory framework may result in significant additional capital expenditures, increases in operating and compliance costs and adjustments to our pricing models. in addition, if we are unable for any reason to realize the goals of our business plans for these businesses, we may not earn sufficient incentive compensation to maintain prior revenue levels. we are subject to increased foreign currency exchange rate risks because a majority of our cash flows and reported earnings are currently generated by our u.k. business operations. these risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value of the british pound sterling and the u.s. dollar between the time we initially invest u.s. dollars in our u.k. businesses and the time that cash is repatriated to the u.s. from the u.k., including cash flows from our u.k. businesses that may be distributed to ppl or used for repayments of intercompany loans or other general corporate purposes. in addition, ppl's consolidated reported earnings on a u.s. gaap basis may be subject to increased earnings translation risk, which is the result of the conversion of earnings as reported in our u.k. businesses on a british pound sterling basis to a u.s. dollar basis in accordance with u.s. gaap requirements. our u.k. distribution business contributes a significant portion of ppl's total annual revenues and exposes us to the following additional risks related to operating outside the u.s., including risks associated with changes in u.k. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions and political conditions and policies of the u.k. government and the european union. these risks may reduce the results of operations from our u.k. distribution business or affect our ability to access u.k. revenues for payment of distributions or for other corporate purposes in the u.s. changes in laws or regulations relating to u.k. operations, including tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies; changes in labor relations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; changes in u.s. tax law applicable to taxation of foreign earnings; and compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws. 24 (all registrants except ppl energy supply) risks related to domestic regulated utility operations our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to each of the kentucky regulated segment and the pennsylvania regulated segment. set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments. our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments. regulators may not approve the rates we request. the rates we charge our utility customers must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the ferc, kpsc, vscc, tra and puc. although rate regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments. in any rate-setting proceedings, federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our rate requests, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we seek. although our rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year or based on future projected costs, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. our domestic regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will likely require rate increase requests to the regulators. if our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation. in addition to regulating the rates we charge, various federal and state regulatory authorities regulate many aspects of our domestic utility operations, including: the terms and conditions of our service and operations; financial and capital structure matters; siting, construction and operation of facilities; mandatory reliability and safety standards under the energy policy act of 2005 and other standards of conduct; accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies; tax matters; affiliate transactions; acquisition and disposal of utility assets and issuance of securities; and various other matters, including energy efficiency. such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties which may not be recoverable from customers. changes in transmission and wholesale power market structures could increase costs or reduce revenues. wholesale revenues fluctuate with regional demand, fuel prices and contracted capacity. changes to transmission and wholesale power market structures and prices may occur in the future, are not predictable and may result in unforeseen effects on energy purchases and sales, transmission and related costs or revenues. these can include commercial or regulatory changes affecting power pools, exchanges or markets in which our domestic utilities participate. our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs. the domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of lg&amp;e and ku) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. the completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including: 25 approval, licensing and permitting; land acquisition and the availability of suitable land; skilled labor or equipment shortages; construction problems or delays, including disputes with third-party intervenors; increases in commodity prices or labor rates; contractor performance; environmental considerations and regulations; weather and geological issues; and political, labor and regulatory developments. failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators. risks specific to kentucky regulated segment ( ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku ) the costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are significant and are subject to continuing changes. extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to lg&amp;e's and ku's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, among other business-related activities, and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted but could be material. in addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures, operations changes, permit limitations or other restrictions. at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. market prices for energy and capacity also affect this cost-effectiveness analysis. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products and demand for our services. ongoing changes in environmental regulations or their implementation requirements and our compliance strategies relating thereto entail a number of uncertainties. the environmental standards governing lg&amp;e's and ku's businesses, particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to ongoing rulemakings and other regulatory developments, legislative activities and litigation. revisions to applicable standards, changes in compliance deadlines and invalidation of rules on appeal may require major changes in compliance strategies, operations or assets and adjustments to prior plans. depending on the extent, frequency and timing of such changes, the companies may be subject to inconsistent requirements under multiple regulatory programs, compressed windows for decision-making and short compliance deadlines that may require aggressive schedules for construction, permitting, and other regulatory approvals. under such circumstances, the companies may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, delayed or incomplete rate recovery or increased costs of implementation. risks specific to pennsylvania regulated segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) we may be subject to higher transmission costs and other risks as a result of pjm's regional transmission expansion plan (rtep) process. pjm and the ferc have authority to require upgrades or expansion of the regional transmission grid, which can result in substantial expenditures for transmission owners. as discussed in note 8 to the financial statements, we expect to make substantial expenditures to construct the susquehanna-roseland and northeast/pocono transmission lines that pjm has determined are necessary for the reliability of the regional transmission grid. although the ferc has granted our request for incentive rate treatment of such facilities, we cannot be certain that all costs that we may incur will be recoverable. in addition, the date when these facilities will be in service, which can be significantly impacted by delays related to public opposition or other factors, is subject to the outcome of future events that are not all within our control. as a result, we cannot predict the ultimate financial or operational impact of this project or other rtep projects on ppl electric. 26 we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to pennsylvania conservation and energy efficiency programs. ppl electric is subject to act 129 which contains requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposes plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing aeps. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. utilities not meeting these act 129 requirements are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. risks related to supply segment ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) our costs to comply with existing and new environmental laws are expected to continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital expenditures for pollution control improvements that could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity or cause the continued operation of certain generation facilities to be uneconomic. our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection. to comply with existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control measures we may take, we have spent and expect to spend substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and compliance. since 2005, we have spent more than $1.6 billion to install scrubbers and other pollution control equipment in our competitive generation fleet in order to comply with existing and proposed federal and state environmental laws and regulations primarily governing air emissions from coal-fired plants. many states and environmental groups, however, have challenged certain federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict. in addition, more recently, attention has also been refocused on effluent emissions and the handling of ccrs. as a result, state and federal regulations have been adopted that would impose more stringent restrictions than are currently in effect, which could require us significantly to increase capital expenditures for additional pollution control equipment. at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for our planned capital projects which are necessary to our business. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted, reduced or subjected to additional costs. we face intense competition in our energy supply business, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. unlike our rate-regulated utility businesses, our energy supply business is dependent on our ability to operate in a competitive environment and is not assured of any rate of return on capital investments through a regulated rate structure. competition is affected by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. these competitive factors may negatively affect our ability to sell electricity and related products and services, as well as the prices that we may charge for such products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow our business. we sell our available energy and capacity into the competitive wholesale markets through contracts of varying duration. competition in the wholesale power markets occurs principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of reliability and availability. we believe that the commencement of commercial operation of new electricity generating facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity and the evolution of demand side management resources will continue to increase competition in the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on electricity and capacity prices. 27 we also face competition in the wholesale markets for generation capacity and ancillary services. we primarily compete with other electricity suppliers based on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. we also compete against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to credit sources, and our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. competitors in the wholesale power markets in which ppl generation subsidiaries and ppl energyplus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators, competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities and financial institutions. adverse changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. our energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power exceed our costs to supply power, are impacted by changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, recs, electricity capacity and related congestion charges and other costs. unlike most commodities, the limited ability to store electricity requires that it must be consumed at the time of production. as a result, wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short time periods and can be unpredictable. among the factors that influence such prices are: demand for electricity; supply for electricity available from current or new generation resources; variable production costs, primarily fuel (and associated transportation costs) and emission allowance expense for the generation resources used to meet the demand for electricity; transmission capacity and service into, or out of, markets served; changes in the regulatory framework for wholesale power markets; liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, as well as general creditworthiness of key participants in the market; and weather and economic conditions affecting demand for or the price of electricity or the facilities necessary to deliver electricity. our risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices, interest rates and counterparty credit and non-performance risks may not work as planned, and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs. we actively manage the market risk inherent in our generation and energy marketing activities, as well as our debt and counterparty credit positions. we have implemented procedures to monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs, including independent validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, portfolio stress tests, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics. nonetheless, our risk management programs may not work as planned. for example, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management calculations. additionally, unforeseen market disruptions could decrease market depth and liquidity, negatively impacting our ability to enter into new transactions. we enter into financial contracts to hedge commodity basis risk, and as a result are exposed to the risk that the correlation between delivery points could change with actual physical delivery. similarly, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not designed to address. as a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events result in greater losses or costs than our risk models predict or greater volatility in our earnings and financial position. in addition, our trading, marketing and hedging activities are exposed to counterparty credit risk and market liquidity risk. we have adopted a credit risk management policy and program to evaluate counterparty credit risk. however, if counterparties fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices. in that event, our financial results could be adversely affected. we do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price volatility. we attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity sales obligations by either reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and services through competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts. we also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements and other electricity-related commodities. however, based on economic and other considerations, we may decide not to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price risk. to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price risk, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. 28 we are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale and retail electricity markets. we purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based tariffs authorized by ferc throughout the u.s. and also enter into short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price fluctuations. if we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay damages. these damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of any undelivered capacity or electricity. depending on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be significant. extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, environmental compliance costs, transmission disruptions, and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and electricity. our wholesale power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post collateral for the benefit of our counterparties if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. we currently believe that we have sufficient credit to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these power contracts. however, our obligation to post collateral could exceed the amount of our facilities or our ability to increase our facilities could be limited by financial markets or other factors. see note 7 to the financial statements for a discussion of ppl's credit facilities. we also face credit risk that counterparties with whom we contract in both the wholesale and retail markets will default in their performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the inception of the contract. whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these risks using various means, including agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract price in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. however, there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance risk, including bankruptcy, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our obligations to other parties, which could in turn subject us to claims for damages. the full-requirements sales contracts that ppl energyplus is awarded do not provide for specific levels of load and actual load significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy margins. we generally hedge our full-requirements sales contracts with energy purchases from third parties, and to a lesser extent with our own generation. if the actual load is significantly lower than the expected load, we may be required to resell power at a lower price than was contracted for to supply the load obligation, resulting in a financial loss. alternatively, a significant increase in load could adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of the full-requirements sales contracts to provide the energy necessary to fulfill increased demand at the contract price, which could be lower than the cost to procure additional energy on the open market. therefore, any significant decrease or increase in load compared with our forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. unforeseen changes in the price of coal and natural gas could cause us to incur excess coal inventories and contract termination costs. extraordinarily low natural gas prices during 2012 and 2013 caused natural gas to be the more cost-competitive fuel compared to coal for generating electricity. because we enter into guaranteed supply contracts to provide for the amount of coal needed to operate our base load coal-fired generating facilities, we may experience periods where we hold excess amounts of coal if fuel pricing results in our reducing or idling coal-fired generating facilities in favor of operating available alternative natural gas-fired generating facilities. in addition, we may incur costs to terminate supply contracts for coal in excess of our generating requirements as occurred in 2012. we may experience disruptions in our fuel supply, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our generation facilities. we purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. disruption in the delivery of fuel and other products consumed during the production of electricity (such as coal, natural gas, oil, water, uranium, lime, limestone and other chemicals), including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. 29 we rely on transmission and distribution assets that we do not own or control to deliver our wholesale electricity. if transmission is disrupted, or not operated efficiently, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver power may be hindered. we depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell in the wholesale market, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electricity generation facilities. if transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by isos and rtos, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or we may be unable to sell products on the most favorable terms. the ferc has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that transmission capacity will not be available in the amounts we require. we cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether isos and rtos in applicable markets will efficiently operate transmission networks and provide related services. despite federal and state deregulation initiatives, our supply business is still subject to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or prevent or delay operation of our facilities. our generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market. generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the ferc. the ferc has authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices. the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates. any reduction by the ferc in the rates we may receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations. see "regulatory issues - ferc market-based rate authority" in note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the ferc's market-based rate authority program. in addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals. if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to additional costs. changes in technology may negatively impact the value of our power plants. a basic premise of our generation business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at relatively low prices. there are alternate technologies to produce electricity, most notably fuel cells, micro turbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells, the development of which has been expanded due to global climate change concerns. research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in alternate technologies. it is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternative generation to a level that is equal to or below that of certain central station production. also, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators. these alternative energy sources could result in a decline to the dispatch and capacity factors of our plants. as a result of all of these factors, the value of our generation facilities could be significantly reduced. we are subject to certain risks associated with nuclear generation, including the risk that our susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to increased security or safety requirements that would increase capital and operating expenditures, uncertainties regarding spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its licensed life. nuclear generation accounted for about 33% of our 2013 competitive generation output. the risks of nuclear generation generally include: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and 30 uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. the licenses for our two nuclear units expire in 2042 and 2044. see note 21 to the financial statements for additional information on the aro related to the decommissioning. the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, including security, safety and employee-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. in the event of noncompliance, the nrc has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. in addition, revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the nrc, particularly in response to the 2011 incident in fukushima, japan, could necessitate substantial capital or operating expenditures at our susquehanna nuclear plant. there also remains substantial uncertainty regarding the temporary storage and permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel, which could result in substantial additional costs to ppl that cannot be predicted. in addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our susquehanna plant, if an incident did occur, any

control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting at item 9a. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. in our opinion, ppl corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2013, based on the coso criteria. we also have audited, in

(ppl and ppl energy supply) anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply in recognition of the changes in recent years in the wholesale power markets, ppl performed an in-depth analysis of its business mix to determine the best available opportunities to maximize the value of its competitive generation business for shareowners. as a result, in june 2014, ppl and ppl energy supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of riverstone to combine their competitive power generation businesses into a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named talen energy. under the terms of the agreements, at closing, ppl will spin off to ppl shareowners a newly formed entity, talen energy holdings, inc. (holdco), which at such time will own all of the membership interests of ppl energy supply and all of the common stock of talen energy. immediately following the spinoff, holdco will merge with a special purpose subsidiary of talen energy, with holdco continuing as the surviving company to the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of talen energy and the sole owner of ppl energy supply. substantially contemporaneous with the spinoff and merger, rjs power will be contributed by its owners to become a subsidiary of talen energy. following completion of these transactions, ppl shareowners will own 65% of talen energy and affiliates of riverstone will own 35%. ppl will have no continuing ownership interest in, control of, or affiliation with talen energy and ppl's shareowners will receive a number of talen energy shares at closing based on the number of ppl shares owned as of the spinoff record date. the spinoff will have no effect on the number of ppl common shares owned by ppl shareowners or the number of shares of ppl common stock outstanding. the transaction is intended to be tax-free to ppl and its shareowners for u.s. federal income tax purposes and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain regulatory approvals by the nrc, ferc, doj and puc. in addition, there must be available, subject to certain conditions, at least $1 billion of undrawn credit capacity under a talen energy (or its subsidiaries) revolving credit or similar facility. any letters of credit or other credit support measures posted in connection with energy marketing and trading transactions at the time of the spinoff are excluded from this calculation. on december 18, 2014, the ferc issued a final order approving, subject to certain market power mitigation requirements, the combination of the competitive generation assets to form talen energy. on january 27, 2015, ppl and an affiliate of rjs power filed a joint response with the ferc accepting additional market power mitigation measures required for the ferc's approval. ppl and rjs power originally proposed divesting either of two groups of assets each having approximately 1,300 mw of generating capacity. ppl and rjs power have agreed that within 12 months after closing of the transaction, talen energy will divest generating assets in one of the groups (from ppl energy supply's existing portfolio, this includes either the holtwood and wallenpaupack hydroelectric facilities or the ironwood facility), and limit pjm energy market offers from assets it would retain in the other group to cost-based offers. the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015. talen energy will own and operate a diverse mix of approximately 14,000 mw (after divestitures to meet ferc market power standards) of generating capacity in certain u.s. competitive energy markets primarily in pjm and ercot. 4 following the transaction, ppl's focus will be on its regulated utility businesses in the u.k., kentucky and pennsylvania, serving more than 10 million customers. ppl intends to maintain a strong balance sheet and manage its finances consistent with maintaining investment grade credit ratings and providing a competitive total shareowner return, including an attractive dividend. excluding costs required to provide transition services to talen energy and following the spinoff transaction, ppl expects to reduce annual ongoing corporate support costs by approximately $75 million. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. montana hydro sale in november 2014, ppl montana completed the sale to northwestern of 633 mw of hydroelectric generating facilities located in montana for approximately $900 million in cash. the sale included 11 hydroelectric generating facilities and related assets. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. distribution of ppl global (ppl energy supply) in january 2011, ppl energy supply distributed its entire membership interest in ppl global to its parent, ppl energy funding (the parent holding company of ppl energy supply and ppl global with no other material operations), to better align ppl's organizational structure with the manner in which it manages these businesses and reports segment information in its consolidated financial statements. the distribution separated the u.s.-based competitive energy marketing and supply business from the u.k.-based regulated electricity distribution business. acquisitions (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) on november 1, 2010, ppl acquired all of the limited liability company interests of e.on u.s. llc from a wholly owned subsidiary of e.on ag. upon completion of the acquisition, e.on u.s. llc was renamed lg&amp;e and ku energy llc. (ppl) on april 1, 2011, ppl, through an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, ppl wem, acquired all of the outstanding ordinary share capital of central networks east plc and central networks limited, the sole owner of central networks west plc, together with certain other related assets and liabilities (collectively referred to as central networks and subsequently defined herein as wpd midlands), from subsidiaries of e.on ag. wpd midlands operates two regulated distribution networks in the midlands area of england and is included in the u.k. regulated segment. segment information (ppl) ppl is organized into four reportable segments as depicted in the chart above: u.k. regulated, kentucky regulated, pennsylvania regulated and supply. ppl's reportable segments primarily reflect the activities of its related subsidiary registrants, except that the reportable segments are also allocated certain corporate level financing and other costs that are not included in the results of the applicable subsidiary registrants. the u.k. regulated segment has no related subsidiary registrant. upon completion of the anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply in the second quarter of 2015, ppl will no longer have a supply segment. a comparison of ppl's three regulated segments is shown below: 5 kentucky pennsylvania u.k. regulated regulated regulated for the year ended december 31, 2014: operating revenues (in billions) $ 2.6 $ 3.2 $ 2.0 net income attributable to ppl shareowners (in millions) $ 982 $ 312 $ 263 electric energy delivered (gwh) 75,813 31,543 37,026 at december 31, 2014: regulatory asset base (in billions) (a) $ 9.5 $ 8.3 $ 4.9 service area (in square miles) 21,600 9,400 10,000 end-users (in millions) 7.8 1.3 1.4 (a) represents rav for u.k. regulated, capitalization for kentucky regulated and rate base for pennsylvania regulated. see note 2 to the financial statements for additional financial information about the segments. (all registrants except ppl) ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku each operate within a single reportable segment. u.k. regulated segment (ppl) consists of ppl global which primarily includes wpd's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of wpd's earnings from british pound sterling into u.s. dollars, and certain costs, such as u.s. income taxes, administrative costs and allocated financing costs. wpd, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, operates four of the 15 regulated distribution networks providing electricity service in the u.k. the number of network customers (end-users) served by wpd totals 7.8 million across 21,600 square miles in wales and southwest and central england. details of revenue by category for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2014 2013 2012 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue utility revenues $ 2,573 98 $ 2,359 98 $ 2,289 98 energy-related businesses 48 2 44 2 47 2 total $ 2,621 100 $ 2,403 100 $ 2,336 100 the majority of wpd's utility revenue is known as duos and is from providing regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers who use the network to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users. wpd's energy-related business revenues include ancillary activities that support the distribution business. franchise and licenses the operations of wpd's principal subsidiaries, wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands), are regulated by ofgem under the direction of the gas and electricity markets authority. the electricity act 1989 provides the fundamental framework of electricity companies and established licenses that require each of the dnos to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. wpd is authorized by ofgem to provide electricity distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. for instance, wpd is subject to ofgem regulation with respect to the regulated revenue it can earn and the quality of service it must provide, and wpd can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service. ofgem has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license. in january 2014, ofgem and wpd agreed to a reduction of 5 per residential end-user in the 2014/15 regulatory year to be recovered in the 2016/2017 regulatory year. see "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview - distribution revenue reduction" for additional information. in may 2014, ofgem made license changes as part of the riio-ed1 process discussed below. 6 competition although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. wpd's four distribution businesses are, therefore, regulated monopolies which operate under regulatory price controls. revenue and regulation ofgem has established a price control mechanism that provides the amount of base demand revenue that a regulated business can earn and provides for an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for exceeding or underperforming relative to pre-established targets. wpd is currently operating under dpcr5 which is effective for the period from april 1, 2010 through march 31, 2015. in october 2010, ofgem announced changes to the regulatory framework that will be effective for the u.k. electricity distribution sector, including wpd, beginning april 2015. throughout the following discussion of this regulatory framework, the use of the term "customers" refers to the end-users of wpd's regulated distribution networks. the framework, known as riio (revenues = incentives + innovation + outputs), is intended to: encourage dnos to deliver safe, reliable and sustainable network service at long-term value to customers; enable dnos to finance the required investment in a timely and efficient way; and remunerate dnos according to their delivery for customers. in addition to extending the price control period from five to eight years, the key components of riio-ed1 are: increased emphasis on outputs and incentives; enhanced stakeholder engagement including network customers; a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation; replacement of the current low carbon network fund to continue to stimulate innovation; depreciation of rav for additions after april 1, 2015 will be extended from 20 years to 45 years, with a transitional arrangement that will gradually change the life over the price control period that will result in an average life of 35 years for rav additions during riio-ed1. rav at march 31, 2015 will continue to be depreciated over 20 years. the asset lives used to determine depreciation expense for u.s. gaap purposes are not the same as those used for the depreciation of the rav and as such vary by asset type and are based on the expected useful lives of the assets; the ability for dnos to be fast-tracked through the process, providing several benefits to the qualified dnos, including the ability to collect the fast-track incentive, which is additional revenue equivalent to 2.5% of total annual expenditures during the 8-year price control period (approximately $43 million annually for wpd), greater revenue certainty and a higher level of cost savings retention; and capital return comprised of a 10 year trailing average debt allowance, to be adjusted annually, and an equity allowance determined by ofgem with a debt to equity ratio of 65:35. the real cost of equity determined by ofgem for fast-tracked dnos was 6.4% and 6.0% for slow-tracked dnos and will be uplifted by inflation as measured by the retail price index (rpi) to determine the nominal cost of equity. in november 2013, ofgem determined that the 8-year business plans of all four of wpd's dnos were suitable for accelerated consideration or "fast tracking" and as a result merited early settlement of their price controls for the 8-year riio-ed1 period starting april 1, 2015. this was confirmed in february 2014. the u.k. regulatory structure is an incentive-based structure in contrast to the typical u.s. regulatory structure which operates on a cost-recovery model. the base demand revenue that a dno can earn in each year of a price control period is the sum of: (i) the regulator's determination of efficient operating costs, including certain pension deficit funding, (ii) a return on capital from rav plus an annual adjustment for inflation as determined by the rpi, (iii) a return of capital from rav (i.e. depreciation), (iv) an allowance for taxation less a potential reduction for tax benefits from excess leverage, (v) legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods and (vi) certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control. as wpd's four dnos were fast-tracked through the price control review process for riio-ed1, their base demand revenue also includes the fast-track incentive discussed above. the riio-ed1 price control will also include an annual iteration process. this will allow base demand revenues to be updated during the price control for financial adjustments covering tax, pension and cost of debt issues, adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the total cost incentive mechanism and the information quality incentive (iqi) discussed below, and legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods. this process calculates an incremental change to base revenue, known as the "mod." riio-ed1 prices will be set using a forecast of rpi which is trued up 2 years later. 7 during dpcr5, wpd's total base demand revenue for the five-year period was profiled in a manner that resulted in a weighted-average increase of about 5.5% per year for all four dnos. in the first year of riio-ed1, base demand revenue will decrease by about 11.8% primarily due to a change in the profiling approach and a lower weighted-average cost of capital. for each regulatory year thereafter, base demand revenue will increase by approximately 1% per annum before inflation for the remainder of riio-ed1. in addition to base demand revenue, certain other items are added or subtracted to arrive at allowed revenue. the most significant of these are discussed below. during the price control period, wpd's revenue is decoupled from volume. however, in any fiscal period, wpd's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular period. conversely, wpd could also over-recover revenue. over and under-recoveries are added or subtracted to base demand revenue in future years. over and under-recovered amounts arising from 2014/15 onwards and refunded/recovered under riio-ed1 will be refunded/recovered on a two year lag (previously one year). therefore the 2014/15 over/ under-recovery adjustment will occur in 2016/17 instead of in 2015/16. in 2016/17, wpd will recover the 5 per residential network customer reduction provided for in 2014/15 as that amount is currently considered an under-recovery. under applicable u.s. gaap, wpd does not record a receivable for under-recoveries, but does record a liability for over-recoveries. wpd is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by gaap. see note 1 to the financial statements for additional information. ofgem has established incentive mechanisms to provide significant opportunities to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. some of the more significant incentive mechanisms include: information quality incentive (iqi) - the iqi is designed to incentivize the dnos to provide good quality information in the business plans they submit to ofgem during the price control review process and to execute their business plans as submitted. the iqi eliminates the distinction between capital expenditure and operating expense and instead focuses on total expenditure: dpcr5 - 85% of all network related expenditure is allocated to rav and currently recovered over 20 years through the regulatory depreciation of rav and 15% is recovered in the year of expenditure together with business support, non-operational capital expenditures and traffic management expenditures. the iqi provides for incentives or penalties at the end of dpcr5 under the rolling rav incentive mechanism based on the ratio of actual expenditures to the expenditures submitted to ofgem that were the basis for the revenues allowed for the five-year price control period. in addition, at the beginning of dpcr5, wpd was awarded $301 million in iqi revenue of which $222 million will be included in revenue throughout the current price control period with the balance recovered over 20 years through the rav mechanism. riio-ed1 - 80% of total costs will be allocated to rav with 20% recovered in the year of expenditure. as a result of being fast-tracked, wpd's dnos are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against the riio-ed1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends. the cost incentive or penalty mechanism will be calculated each year on a 2 year lag basis as part of the annual mod process discussed above. interruptions incentive scheme (iis) - this incentive has two major components: (1) customer interruptions (cis) and (2) customer minutes lost (cmls), and both are designed to incentivize the dnos to invest and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages. during dpcr5 the target for each dno is based on a benchmark of data from the last four years of the prior price control period. the iis target under riio-ed1 will be divided into interruptions caused by planned and unplanned work. the target for planned work will be calculated as the annual average level of planned interruptions and minutes lost over a previous three year period. the target for unplanned interruptions for the first year of riio-ed1 is specified in the dno's license and targets for both the cis and cmls become more demanding each year. in addition to the iis, the broad measure of customer service is enhanced. this broad measure encompasses: customer satisfaction in supply interruptions, connections and general inquiries; complaints; stakeholder engagement; and delivery of social obligations. the following table shows the amount of incentive revenue, primarily from iis, which wpd has earned since the beginning of dpcr5: 8 incentive earned regulatory year ended incentive regulatory year ended (in millions) included in revenue march 2011 $ 30 march 2013 march 2012 83 march 2014 march 2013 104 march 2015 march 2014 125 march 2016 for regulatory years 2015/16 through 2018/19 allowed revenue will also be reduced to reflect ofgem's final decision on the dpcr4 line loss incentives and penalties mechanism. wpd has a liability recorded related to this future revenue reduction; therefore, this will not impact future earnings. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to u.k. regulated segment" for additional information on the risks associated with the u.k. regulated segment. customers wpd provides regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers (its customers) who use the network to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users. wpd bills the energy supplier for this service and the supplier is responsible for billing the end-users. ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the distribution connection and use of system agreement. this agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to collateralize for its payment obligations. kentucky regulated segment (ppl) consists of the operations of lke, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of lg&amp;e and ku. in addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the kentucky regulated segment. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lg&amp;e and ku, direct subsidiaries of lke, are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky and, in ku's case, virginia and tennessee. lg&amp;e also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. lg&amp;e provides electric service to approximately 400,000 customers in louisville and adjacent areas in kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 321,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in kentucky. ku provides electric service to approximately 515,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western kentucky, approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern virginia, and fewer than ten customers in tennessee, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. ku also sells wholesale electricity to 12 municipalities in kentucky under load following contracts. in virginia, ku operates under the name old dominion power company. details of operating revenues by customer class for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2014 2013 2012 % of % of % of revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue lke commercial $ 815 26 $ 770 26 $ 723 26 industrial 627 20 587 20 551 20 residential 1,281 40 1,205 40 1,071 39 retail - other 279 9 260 9 270 10 wholesale - municipal 109 3 110 4 102 4 wholesale - other (a) 57 2 44 1 42 1 total $ 3,168 100 $ 2,976 100 $ 2,759 100 9 2014 2013 2012 % of % of % of revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue lg&amp;e commercial $ 433 28 $ 405 29 $ 374 28 industrial 194 13 186 13 170 13 residential 650 43 614 44 548 41 retail - other 130 8 119 8 131 10 wholesale - other (a) (b) 126 8 86 6 101 8 total $ 1,533 100 $ 1,410 100 $ 1,324 100 ku commercial $ 382 22 $ 365 22 $ 349 23 industrial 433 25 401 25 381 25 residential 631 36 591 36 523 34 retail - other 149 9 141 9 139 9 wholesale - municipal 109 6 110 7 102 7 wholesale - other (a) (b) 33 2 27 1 30 2 total $ 1,737 100 $ 1,635 100 $ 1,524 100 (a) includes wholesale power and transmission revenues. (b) includes intercompany power sales and transmission revenues, which are eliminated upon consolidation at lke. franchises and licenses lg&amp;e and ku provide electricity delivery service, and lg&amp;e provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. competition there are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of lke. from time to time, bills are introduced into the kentucky general assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. neither the kentucky general assembly nor the kpsc has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in kentucky. the nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on lke, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. ku's operations in virginia have been and remain regulated. alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels provide indirect competition for natural gas revenues of lke. marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. lg&amp;e's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity; therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact profitability. however, some large industrial and commercial customers may physically bypass lg&amp;e's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems. power supply at december 31, 2014, lke owned, controlled or had a minority ownership interest in generating capacity (summer rating) of 8,087 mw, of which 3,342 mw related to lg&amp;e and 4,745 mw related to ku, in kentucky, indiana, and ohio. see "item 2. properties - kentucky regulated segment" for a complete list of lke's generating facilities. the system capacity of lke's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances. during 2014, lke's kentucky power plants generated the following amounts of electricity. gwh fuel source lke lg&amp;e ku coal (a) 33,768 14,944 18,824 oil / gas 1,505 522 983 hydro 344 272 72 total (b) 35,617 15,738 19,879 10 (a) includes 896 gwh of power generated by and purchased from ovec for lke, 620 gwh for lg&amp;e and 276 gwh for ku. (b) this generation represents a 1.4% increase for lke, a 5.4% increase for lg&amp;e and a 1.6% decrease for ku from 2013 output. a majority of lg&amp;e's and ku's generated electricity was used to supply its retail and municipal customer base. lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail and municipal customers. when lg&amp;e has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of ku, ku purchases electricity from lg&amp;e. when ku has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail and municipal customers and its generation cost is lower than that of lg&amp;e, lg&amp;e purchases electricity from ku. see "item 2. properties - kentucky regulated segment" for additional information regarding lg&amp;e's and ku's cane run unit 7 which is currently under construction, and lg&amp;e's and ku's cpcn application to construct a solar generating facility at the e.w. brown generating site. as a result of environmental requirements, lg&amp;e and ku anticipate retiring five older coal-fired electric generating units at the cane run plant in 2015 and the green river plant in 2016, which have a combined summer capacity rating of 724 mw. in addition, ku retired the remaining 71 mw coal-fired unit at the tyrone plant in february 2013 and retired a 12 mw gas-fired unit at the haefling plant in december 2013. fuel supply coal is expected to be the predominant fuel used by lg&amp;e and ku for baseload generation for the foreseeable future. however, natural gas will play a more significant role starting in 2015 when cane run unit 7 is expected to be placed into operation as baseload generation. the natural gas for this generating unit will be contracted from suppliers separately from lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. natural gas and oil will continue to be used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. to enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, lg&amp;e and ku have secured long-term pipeline capacity on the interstate pipeline serving the new ngcc unit at cane run and six simple cycle combustion turbine units. lg&amp;e and ku have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2019 and normally augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. for their existing units, lg&amp;e and ku expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western kentucky, southern indiana and southern illinois. in 2015 and beyond, lg&amp;e and ku may purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from wyoming for blending at tc2. coal is delivered to the generating plants by barge, truck and rail. (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) natural gas distribution supply five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 bcf, are used in providing natural gas service to lg&amp;e's firm sales customers. by using natural gas storage facilities, lg&amp;e avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads. natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. without this storage capacity, lg&amp;e would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are typically at their highest. several suppliers under contracts of varying duration provide competitively priced natural gas. at december 31, 2014, lg&amp;e had 12 bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $54 million. lg&amp;e has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying terms with a number of suppliers designed to meet its firm sales obligations. these natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. in tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. 11 lg&amp;e purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. lg&amp;e has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by lg&amp;e between 2015 and 2020. total winter season capacity under these contracts is 194,900 mmbtu/day and summer season capacity is 88,000 mmbtu/day. additionally, lg&amp;e has a contract with the same pipeline for the month of january 2015 with a total capacity of 35,000 mmbtu/day, and a contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 mmbtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in october 2018. lg&amp;e expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in south texas, east texas, north louisiana and arkansas, as well as gas originating in the rockies, marcellus and utica production areas. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) transmission lg&amp;e and ku contract with the tennessee valley authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with transerv international, inc. to act as their independent transmission operator. in february 2013, lg&amp;e and ku submitted a compliance filing to the ferc reflecting their participation with other utilities in the southeastern regional transmission planning group relating to certain ferc order 1000 requirements. ferc order 1000, issued in july 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electric transmission planning activities. rates lg&amp;e is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc and the ferc, and ku is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc, the ferc, the vscc and the tra. lg&amp;e and ku operate under a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff (oatt). lg&amp;e's and ku's kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. as such, lg&amp;e and ku generally earn a return on regulatory assets. ku's virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of virginia base rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. ku's rates to 12 municipal customers for wholesale requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. in april 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the original notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date. in addition, a tenth municipality has a previously settled termination date of 2016. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms. rate case on november 26, 2014, lg&amp;e and ku filed requests with the kpsc for increases in annual base electricity rates of approximately $30 million at lg&amp;e and approximately $153 million at ku and an increase in annual base gas rates of approximately $14 million at lg&amp;e. the proposed base rate increases would result in electricity rate increases of 2.7% at lg&amp;e and 9.6% at ku and a gas rate increase of 4.2% at lg&amp;e and would become effective in july 2015. lg&amp;e's and ku's applications each include a request for authorized returns-on-equity of 10.5%. the applications are based on a forecasted test year of july 1, 2015 through june 30, 2016. a number of parties have been granted intervention requests in the proceedings. a hearing on the applications is scheduled to commence on april 21, 2015. lg&amp;e and ku cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. 12 pennsylvania regulated segment (ppl) includes the regulated electricity delivery operations of ppl electric. (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central pennsylvania. ppl electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers in this area as a plr under the customer choice act. details of revenues by customer class for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2014 2013

its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. competition pursuant to authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. pursuant to the customer choice act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in pennsylvania, and ppl electric does not own or operate any generation facilities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. rates and regulation transmission ppl electric's transmission facilities are within pjm, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. pjm serves as a ferc-approved rto to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. in addition to operating the electricity transmission network, pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary objective of any rto is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the rto directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. certain types of transmission investment are subject to competitive processes outlined in the pjm tariff. as a transmission owner, ppl electric's transmission revenues are recovered through pjm in accordance with a ferc approved tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula rate mechanism. as a plr, ppl electric also purchases transmission services from pjm. see "plr" below. 13 see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on rate mechanisms. distribution ppl electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the puc. currently, ppl electric's smart meter rider and the dsic are the only regulatory assets earning a return. certain operating expenses are also included in ppl electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes. pennsylvania's aeps requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania from alternative energy sources. under the default service procurement plans approved by the puc, ppl electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the aeps. act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new plr generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing aeps. act 11 authorizes the puc to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a dsic. such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to ppl electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. in january 2013, ppl electric filed a petition requesting permission to establish a dsic. in may 2013, the puc approved ppl electric's proposed dsic with an initial rate effective july 1, 2013, subject to refund after hearings. the puc also assigned four technical recovery calculation issues to the office of administrative law judge for hearing and preparation of a recommended decision. in august 2014, the presiding administrative law judge issued a recommended decision which would not have a significant impact on ppl electric. this matter remains pending before the puc. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129, act 11 and other legislative and regulatory impacts. plr the customer choice act requires electric distribution companies (edcs), including ppl electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the puc to act as a plr of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the plr pursuant to regulations established by the puc. as of december 31, 2014, the following percentages of ppl electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 50% of residential, 83% of small commercial and industrial and 99% of large commercial and industrial customers. the puc continues to be interested in expanding the competitive market for electricity. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. ppl electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period june 2013 through may 2015, which includes 4 solicitations for electricity supply held in april and october, annually. pursuant to this plan, ppl electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, large commercial and large industrial customers who elect to take that service from ppl electric. these solicitations include a mix of 12- and 9-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, and 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and large industrial customers to fulfill ppl electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a plr. in april 2014, ppl electric filed a new default service plan with the puc for the period of june 1, 2015 through may 31, 2017. the petition was approved by the puc on january 15, 2015. numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in ppl electric's service territory. since the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for ppl electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers. see "energy purchase commitments" in note 13 to the financial statements for additional information regarding ppl electric's solicitations. 14 supply segment (ppl) consists primarily of the activities of ppl energy supply's subsidiaries, ppl generation and ppl energyplus. ppl generation owns and operates competitive domestic power plants to generate electricity and acquires and develops competitive domestic generation projects. ppl energyplus markets and trades electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related products in competitive wholesale and retail markets. in addition, certain financing and other costs are allocated to the supply segment. upon completion of the anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply in 2015, ppl will no longer have a supply segment. see "anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply" above for additional information. (ppl and ppl energy supply) ppl energy supply's generation assets are primarily located in pennsylvania and montana. ppl energy supply enters into energy and energy-related contracts to hedge the variability of expected cash flows associated with its generating units and marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes. ppl energyplus sells the electricity produced by ppl energy supply's generation plants based on prevailing market rates. ppl energy supply's total expected generation in 2015 is anticipated to be used to meet its committed contractual sales. ppl energy supply has also entered into commitments of varying quantities and terms for 2016 and beyond. details of revenue by category for the years ended december 31, are shown below. 2014 2013 2012 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue energy unregulated wholesale energy (a) $ 1,892 51 $ 2,960 65 $ 4,054 76 unregulated retail energy 1,243 33 1,027 23 844 16 total energy 3,135 84 3,987 88 4,898 92 energy-related businesses (b) 601 16 527 12 448 8 total $ 3,736 100 $ 4,514 100 $ 5,346 100 (a) included in these amounts for 2014, 2013 and 2012 are $84 million, $51 million and $78 million of wholesale electricity sales to an affiliate, ppl electric, which are eliminated in consolidation for ppl. (b) energy-related businesses primarily support the generation, marketing and trading businesses of ppl energy supply. their activities include developing renewable energy projects and providing energy-related products and services to commercial and industrial customers through their mechanical contracting and services subsidiaries. energy-related businesses for ppl's supply segment had additional revenues not related to ppl energy supply of $13 million for 2012, which are not included in this table. power supply ppl energy supply owned or controlled generating capacity (summer rating) of 9,896 mw at december 31, 2014. generating capacity controlled by ppl generation and other ppl energy supply subsidiaries includes power obtained through ppl energyplus' power purchase agreements. see "item 2. properties - supply segment" for details of ppl energy supply's generating capacity. during 2014, ppl energy supply owned or controlled power plants that generated the following amounts of electricity. gwh fuel source northeastern northwestern total nuclear 16,903 16,903 oil / gas 11,080 11,080 coal 16,074 4,030 20,104 hydro (a) 931 3,318 4,249 renewables (b) 413 413 total 45,401 7,348 52,749 (a) the northwestern amount reflects generation from hydroelectric generating facilities that were sold by ppl montana to northwestern in november 2014. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. (b) ppl energy supply subsidiaries own or control renewable energy projects located in pennsylvania, new jersey, vermont and new hampshire with a generating capacity (summer rating) of 25 mw. ppl energyplus sells the energy, capacity and recs produced by these plants into the wholesale market as well as to commercial and industrial customers. 15 ppl energy supply's generation subsidiaries are ewgs that sell electricity into wholesale markets. ewgs are subject to regulation by the ferc, which has authorized these ewgs to sell the electricity generated at market-based prices. this electricity is sold to ppl energyplus under ferc-jurisdictional power purchase agreements. ppl susquehanna is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of the susquehanna nuclear units. certain of ppl energy supply's other subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc in connection with the operation of their fossil plants with respect to certain level and density monitoring devices. certain operations of ppl generation's subsidiaries are also subject to osha and comparable state statutes. fuel supply coal pennsylvania ppl energyplus actively manages ppl energy supply's coal requirements by purchasing coal principally from mines located in northern appalachia. during 2014, ppl generation purchased 5.6 million tons of coal required for its wholly owned pennsylvania plants. coal inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. ppl generation, by and through its agent ppl energyplus, has agreements in place that will provide more than 16 million tons of ppl generation's projected coal needs for the pennsylvania power plants from 2015 through 2018 and augments its coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. a ppl generation subsidiary owns a 12.34% interest in the keystone plant and a 16.25% interest in the conemaugh plant. ppl generation owns a 12.34% interest in keystone fuels, llc and a 16.25% interest in conemaugh fuels, llc. the keystone plant contracts with keystone fuels, llc for its coal requirements, which provided 4.5 million tons of coal to the keystone plant in 2014. the conemaugh plant requirements are purchased under contract from conemaugh fuels, llc, which provided 4.5 million tons of coal to the conemaugh plant in 2014. all wholly owned ppl generation coal plants within pennsylvania are equipped with scrubbers, which use limestone in their operations. acting as agent for ppl generation, ppl energyplus has entered into limestone contracts with suppliers that will provide for those plants' requirements through 2016. during 2014, 430,000 tons of limestone were delivered to brunner island and montour under these contracts. annual limestone requirements range from approximately 400,000-500,000 tons. montana ppl montana owns a 30% interest in colstrip unit 3 and northwestern owns a 30% interest in colstrip unit 4. ppl montana and northwestern have a sharing agreement that governs each party's responsibilities and rights relating to the operation of colstrip units 3 and 4. under the terms of that agreement, each party is responsible for 15% of the total non-coal operating and construction costs of colstrip units 3 and 4, regardless of whether a particular cost is specific to colstrip unit 3 or 4 and is entitled to take up to 15% of the available generation from units 3 and 4. each party is responsible for its own coal costs. ppl montana, with the other colstrip owners, is party to contracts to purchase 100% of its coal requirements with defined coal quality characteristics and specifications. ppl montana, with the other colstrip units 1 and 2 owner, has a long-term purchase and supply agreement with the current supplier for units 1 and 2, which provides these units 85% to 100% of their coal requirements (at owners' option) from january 2015 through december 2019. ppl montana, with the other colstrip units 3 and 4 owners, has a long-term coal supply contract for units 3 and 4, which provides these units 100% of their coal requirements through december 2019. these units were originally built containing scrubbers and ppl montana has entered into a long-term contract to purchase the limestone requirements for these units. the contract extends through december 2030. coal supply contracts are in place to purchase low-sulfur coal with defined quality characteristics and specifications for ppl montana's corette plant. the contracts covered 100% of the plant's coal requirements in 2014 and similar contracts are in place to supply 100% of the expected coal requirements through the suspension of plant operations scheduled for no later than april 2015. the plant is expected to be retired in august 2015. 16 oil and natural gas pennsylvania ppl generation's martins creek units 3 and 4 burn both oil and natural gas. during 2014, 100% of the physical gas requirements for the martins creek units were purchased on the spot market using either delivered supply or a combination of spot market supply and short-term capacity and oil requirements were supplied from inventory and replenished by purchases made in the spot market. at december 31, 2014, there were no long-term agreements for oil or natural gas for these units. short-term and long-term gas transportation contracts are in place for approximately 38% of the maximum daily requirements of the lower mt. bethel combined-cycle facility. for ppl's ironwood combined-cycle facility, ppl energyplus has long-term transportation contracts that can deliver up to approximately 25% of ironwood's maximum daily gas requirements. daily gas requirements can also be met through a combination of short-term transportation capacity release transactions coupled with upstream supply. in addition, ppl energyplus has secured long-term natural gas supply for approximately 10% of the combined needs of ironwood and lower mt. bethel through 2016. nuclear the nuclear fuel cycle consists of several material and service components: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of these concentrates into uranium hexafluoride, a gas component; the enrichment of the hexafluoride gas; the fabrication of fuel assemblies for insertion and use in the reactor core; and the temporary storage and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. ppl susquehanna has a portfolio of supply contracts, with varying expiration dates, for nuclear fuel materials and services. these contracts are expected to provide sufficient fuel to permit unit 1 to operate into the first quarter of 2020 and unit 2 to operate into the first quarter of 2019. ppl susquehanna anticipates entering into additional contracts to ensure continued operation of the nuclear units. federal law requires the u.s. government to provide for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel, but there is no definitive date by which a repository will be operational. as a result, it was necessary to expand susquehanna's on-site spent fuel storage capacity. to support this expansion, ppl susquehanna contracted for the design and construction of a spent fuel storage facility employing dry cask fuel storage technology. the facility is modular, so that additional storage capacity can be added as needed. the facility began receiving spent nuclear fuel in 1999. ppl susquehanna estimates, under current operating conditions, that there is sufficient storage capacity in the spent nuclear fuel pools and the on-site spent fuel storage facility at susquehanna to accommodate spent fuel discharged through approximately 2017. if necessary, the on-site spent fuel storage facility can be expanded, assuming appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, such that, together, the spent fuel pools and the expanded dry fuel storage facility will accommodate all of the spent fuel expected to be discharged through 2044, the current licensed life of the plant. in 1996, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled that the nuclear waste policy act imposed on the doe an unconditional obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel on or before january 31, 1998. in january 2004, ppl susquehanna filed suit in the u.s. court of federal claims for unspecified damages suffered as a result of the doe's breach of its contract to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel. in may 2011, ppl susquehanna entered into a settlement agreement with the u.s. government relating to ppl susquehanna's lawsuit. the settlement included reimbursement of certain costs to store spent nuclear fuel at the susquehanna plant incurred from 1998 through december 31, 2013, and ppl susquehanna received payments for its claimed costs for those periods. in exchange, ppl susquehanna waived any claims against the u.s. government for costs paid or injuries sustained related to storing spent nuclear fuel at the susquehanna plant through december 31, 2013. in january 2014, ppl susquehanna entered into a new agreement with the doe to extend the settlement agreement on the same terms as the prior agreement for an additional three years to the end of 2016. 17 energy marketing ppl energyplus sells the capacity and electricity produced by ppl generation subsidiaries, and buys and sells purchased power, capacity, ancillary services, ftrs, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances and recs in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets. ppl energyplus transacts in competitive retail energy markets, and buys and sells electricity and natural gas supply, to meet the diverse needs of business customers. ppl energyplus sells retail electricity supply to business customers in delaware, the district of columbia, maryland, montana, new jersey, ohio and pennsylvania and sells retail natural gas supply to business customers in delaware, maryland, new jersey, and pennsylvania. the company also offers electricity supply to select residential customers in pennsylvania. although retail energy revenues continue to grow, the net margins related to these activities are not currently a significant component of ppl energy supply's margins. within the constraints of its hedging policy, ppl energyplus actively manages its portfolios of energy and energy-related products to optimize their value and to limit exposure to price fluctuations. see note 17 to the financial statements for more information. competition since the early 1990s, there has been increased competition in u.s. energy markets because of federal and state competitive market initiatives. although some states, such as pennsylvania and montana, have created a competitive market for electricity generation, other states continue to consider different types of regulatory initiatives concerning competition in the power and gas industries. some states that were considering creating competitive markets have slowed their plans or postponed further consideration. in addition, states that have created competitive markets have, from time to time, considered new market rules and re-regulation measures that could result in more limited opportunities for competitive energy suppliers. interest in re-regulation, however, has slowed due to recent declining power prices. as such, the markets in which ppl energy supply participates are highly competitive. ppl energy supply faces competition in wholesale markets for available energy, capacity and ancillary services. competition is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, congestion along the power grid, governmental mandates for new generation, new market entrants, construction of new generating assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. ppl energy supply primarily competes with other electricity suppliers based on its ability to aggregate generation supply at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities and isos. competitors in wholesale power markets include regulated utilities, industrial companies, nugs, competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy marketers. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to supply segment", "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview" and notes 13 and 17 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks faced with respect to competitive energy markets. franchise and licenses see "energy marketing" above for a discussion of ppl energyplus' licenses in various states. ppl energyplus has a license from the doe to export electric energy to canada. ppl energyplus also has a permit from the national energy board of canada to export firm and interruptible energy from canada to the u.s. ppl susquehanna operates units 1 and 2 pursuant to nrc operating licenses that expire in 2042 for unit 1 and in 2044 for unit 2. in 2008, a ppl energy supply subsidiary, ppl bell bend, llc, submitted a cola to the nrc for a new nuclear generating unit (bell bend) to be built adjacent to the susquehanna plant. also in 2008, the cola was formally docketed and accepted for review by the nrc. ppl bell bend, llc does not expect to complete the cola review process with the nrc prior to 2018. see note 8 to financial statements for additional information. ppl holtwood operates the holtwood and wallenpaupack hydroelectric generating plants pursuant to ferc-granted licenses that expire in 2030 and 2045, respectively. 18 other corporate functions (ppl) ppl services provides corporate functions such as financial, legal, supply chain, human resources and information technology services. most of ppl services' costs are charged directly to the respective ppl subsidiaries for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable subsidiaries based on an average of the subsidiaries' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees. upon completion of the anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply and any related transition services to talen energy, the remaining corporate functions that would be provided by ppl services would primarily be in support of ppl electric. as a result, a newly created centralized services company has been formed, ppl eu services, which will provide the majority of corporate functions such as financial, supply chain, human resources and information technology services to ppl electric. significant portions of the various corporate functions within ppl services will be transferred to ppl eu services during 2015 and 2016 as the transition services agreements with talen energy expire. most of ppl eu services' costs will be charged directly to ppl electric for the services provided, with limited amounts charged back to ppl services and its affiliates. ppl services will continue to provide certain limited corporate functions, as the size of the organization is being reduced from approximately 1,200 employees to less than 200 employees after the transition services with talen energy are complete. ppl capital funding, ppl's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of ppl and certain subsidiaries. ppl's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through ppl capital funding, that further enables ppl to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of ppl's rated companies. as a result, ppl plans to further utilize ppl capital funding in future financings, in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies. unlike ppl services and ppl eu services, ppl capital funding's costs are not generally charged to ppl subsidiaries. costs are charged directly to ppl. however, ppl capital funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of lke and wpd midlands and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the kentucky and u.k. regulated segments. the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other ppl capital funding securities, have been assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of ppl management's assessment of segment performance. the financing costs associated primarily with ppl capital funding's securities issuances in 2013 and beyond, with certain exceptions including the remarketing of the debt component of the 2010 and 2011 equity units, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment. see "anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply" above for information on the expected reductions of $75 million in corporate support costs in connection with the spinoff transaction. (all registrants) seasonality the demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. as a result, the registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or extreme winter weather make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned, the retail load served and the terms of contracts to purchase or sell electricity. see "financial condition - environmental matters" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for additional information regarding climate change. financial condition see "financial condition" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for this information. capital expenditure requirements see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information 19 concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for 2015 through 2019. see note 13 to the financial statements for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures from environmental matters. environmental matters the registrants are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. the epa is in the process of proposing and finalizing an unprecedented number of environmental regulations that will directly affect the electricity industry. these initiatives cover air, water and waste. see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" on projected environmental capital expenditures for the years 2015-2019. also, see "environmental matters" in note 13 to the financial statements for additional information. to comply with environmental requirements, ppl's forecast for environmental capital expenditures reflects a best estimate projection of expenditures that may be required within the next five years. such projections are $2.4 billion for ppl, including $2.2 billion for lke ($1.1 billion each for lg&amp;e and ku), and $192 million for ppl energy supply. actual costs (including capital, emission allowance purchases and operational modifications) may be significantly lower or higher depending on the final compliance requirements and market conditions. ppl's and lke's subsidiaries may also incur capital expenditures and operating expenses, which are not now determinable, but could be significant. most environmental compliance costs incurred by lg&amp;e and ku are subject to recovery through a rate recovery mechanism. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. employee relations at december 31, 2014, ppl and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees. ppl energy supply (a) 4,156 ppl electric 2,122 lke ku 949 lg&amp;e 1,029 lks 1,504 total lke 3,482 ppl global (primarily wpd) 6,473 ppl services and other 1,158 total ppl 17,391 (a) includes labor union employees of mechanical contracting subsidiaries, whose numbers tend to fluctuate due to the nature of this business. at december 31, 2014, the breakdown of the total workforce that is represented by labor unions was: number of employees percent of total workforce ppl (a) 9,062 52% ppl energy supply 2,482 60% ppl electric 1,319 62% lke 855 25% lg&amp;e 714 69% ku 141 15% (a) includes 4,076 employees of wpd who are members of labor unions (or 63% of ppl's u.k. workforce). wpd recognizes four unions, the largest of which represents 41% of its union workforce. wpd's electricity business agreement, which covers 4,001 union employees, may be amended by agreement between wpd and the unions and can be terminated with 12 months' notice by either side. see "anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply" in note 8 to the financial statements and "labor union agreements" in note 13 to the financial statements for details on the elimination of approximately 430 domestic positions at ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric. available information ppl's internet website is www.pplweb.com. under the investor heading of that website, ppl provides access to all sec filings of the registrants (including annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(d) or 15(d)) free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec. additionally, the registrants' filings are available at the sec's website (www.sec.gov) and at the sec's public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, dc 20549, or by calling 1-800-sec-0330. 20 item 1a. risk factors the registrants face various risks associated with their businesses. our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. in addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 13 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. as used in this item 1a., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to ppl energy supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the supply segment discussions, or ppl electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania regulated segment discussion, or lke and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the kentucky regulated segment discussion. (ppl and ppl energy supply) risks relating to our agreement to spin off ppl energy supply and form talen energy corporation the proposed spinoff of ppl energy supply and the combination with rjs power are contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions and may present situations that could have an adverse effect on us. the proposed spinoff of ppl energy supply and the subsequent combination with rjs power to form talen energy are complex transactions, subject to various conditions, and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions. on november 5, 2014, talen energy filed a registration statement with the sec containing detailed information regarding talen energy. completion of the proposed spinoff of ppl energy supply and subsequent combination with rjs power will be contingent upon a number of factors, including that (i) ppl receives a favorable legal opinion of tax counsel as described below; (ii) the sec declares effective talen energy's registration statement relating to registration of talen energy common stock and no sec stop order suspending effectiveness of the registration statement be in effect prior to the ppl energy supply spinoff; (iii) the talen energy common stock be authorized for listing on the new york stock exchange; (iv) certain regulatory approvals have been obtained, including approval by the nrc and the ferc, hart-scott-rodino clearance and certain approvals by the puc and (v) there be, subject to certain conditions, at least $1 billion of undrawn credit capacity under a revolving credit facility or similar facility available to talen energy and its subsidiaries (for purposes of which any letters of credit or other credit support measures posted in connection with energy marketing and trading transactions then outstanding shall not be considered as drawn against such facility). the spinoff and subsequent combination may be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties or subject to certain other circumstances, including the failure to complete these transactions by june 30, 2015 or, if the required regulatory approvals have not been obtained at such time but the other conditions to the consummation of these transactions have been or are capable of being satisfied, december 31, 2015. for these and other reasons, the spinoff and subsequent combination may not be completed on the terms or within the expected timeframe, if at all. if the proposed spinoff of ppl energy supply does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under sections 355 and 368 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of ppl or talen energy, then ppl and/or its shareowners may be required to pay substantial u.s. federal income taxes. among other requirements, the completion of the proposed spinoff of ppl energy supply and subsequent combination with rjs power is conditioned upon ppl's receipt of a legal opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff will qualify as a reorganization pursuant to section 368(a)(1)(d) and a tax-free distribution pursuant to section 355 of the code. although receipt of such legal opinion will satisfy a condition to completion of the spinoff and subsequent combination, that legal opinion will not be binding on the irs. accordingly, the irs may reach conclusions that are different from the conclusions reached in such opinion. ppl is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the factual statements or representations on which the legal opinion will be based to be materially different from the facts at the time of the spinoff. if, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, the irs were to determine the distribution to be taxable, ppl would, and its shareowners could, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax liability that could be substantial. in addition, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, if the irs were to determine the merger to be taxable, ppl shareowners may, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax liability that could be material. 21 in addition, the spinoff will be taxable to ppl pursuant to section 355(e) of the code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership (by vote or value) of either ppl or talen energy, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff. because ppl's shareowners will collectively own more than 50% of talen energy's common stock following the spinoff and subsequent combination, the combination alone will not cause the spinoff to be taxable to ppl under section 355(e) of the code. however, section 355(e) of the code might apply if acquisitions of stock of ppl before or after the spinoff, or of talen energy after the combination, are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff. ppl is not aware of any such plan or series of transactions that include the spinoff. ppl may not be successful in realizing the full amount of anticipated annual savings as a result of the proposed spinoff of ppl energy supply. in connection with the spinoff of ppl energy supply, and following any required transition services period, ppl is targeting to reduce its annual corporate support costs by an estimated $185 million. this includes $110 million of corporate support costs to be either eliminated or transferred to talen energy and $75 million of corporate support costs to be eliminated as a result of workforce and other corporate cost reductions. if for any reason ppl cannot realize all or a significant portion of the $75 million corporate cost savings it could have an adverse effect on ppl's cash flows and results of operations. risks related to our u.k. segment our u.k. distribution business contributes more than 50% of ppl's total annual net income and exposes us to the following additional risks related to operating outside the u.s., including risks associated with changes in u.k. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions and political conditions and policies of the u.k. government and the european union. these risks may reduce the results of operations from our u.k. distribution business or affect our ability to access u.k. revenues for payment of distributions or for other corporate purposes in the u.s. changes in laws or regulations relating to u.k. operations, including rate regulations, operational performance and tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies; changes in labor relations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; changes in u.s. tax law applicable to taxation of foreign earnings; and compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws. we are subject to increased foreign currency exchange rate risks because a majority of our cash flows and reported earnings are currently generated by our u.k. business operations. these risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value of the british pound sterling and the u.s. dollar between the time we initially invest u.s. dollars in our u.k. businesses, and our strategy to hedge against such changes, and the time that cash is repatriated to the u.s. from the u.k., including cash flows from our u.k. businesses that may be distributed to ppl or used for repayments of intercompany loans or other general corporate purposes. in addition, ppl's consolidated reported earnings on a u.s. gaap basis may be subject to increased earnings translation risk, which is the result of the conversion of earnings as reported in our u.k. businesses on a british pound sterling basis to a u.s. dollar basis in accordance with u.s. gaap requirements. our u.k. delivery business is subject to risks with respect to rate regulation and operational performance. our u.k. delivery businesses are rate-regulated and operate under an incentive-based regulatory framework. managing operational risk is critical to the u.k. regulated segment's financial performance. disruption to these distribution networks could reduce profitability both directly by incurring costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that ofgem administers relating to customer service levels. 22 a failure by any of our u.k. regulated businesses to comply with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by ofgem that could have an adverse impact on ppl. ofgem has powers to levy fines of up to ten percent of revenue for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may be revoked. ofgem also has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license and there can be no assurance that a restrictive modification will not be introduced in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the u.k. regulated businesses and ppl. (ppl, ppl energy supply and lke) risk related to registrant holding companies ppl's, ppl energy supply's and lke's cash flows and ability to meet their obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and ppl's ability to pay dividends, largely depends on the financial performance of their subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries. ppl, ppl energy supply and lke are holding companies and conduct their operations primarily through subsidiaries. substantially all of the consolidated assets of these registrants are held by their subsidiaries. accordingly, these registrants' cash flows and ability to meet debt and guaranty obligations, as well as ppl's ability to pay dividends, are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends, distributions, loans, advances or repayment of loans and advances. the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends or distributions to their parents or to make funds available for such a payment. the ability of the registrants' subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions in the future will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory requirements, including restrictions on the ability of ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku to pay dividends under section 305(a) of the federal power act. because ppl, ppl energy supply and lke are holding companies, their debt and guaranty obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of their subsidiaries. although certain agreements to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, ppl, ppl energy supply and lke and their subsidiaries retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities. therefore, ppl's, ppl energy supply's and lke's rights and the rights of their creditors, including rights of any debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of their subsidiaries, in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors. in addition, if ppl elects to receive distributions of earnings from its foreign operations, ppl may incur u.s. income taxes, net of any available foreign tax credits, on such amounts. (all registrants except ppl energy supply) risks related to domestic regulated utility operations our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to each of the kentucky regulated segment and the pennsylvania regulated segment. set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments. our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments. regulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged. the rates we charge our utility customers must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the ferc, kpsc, vscc, tra and puc. although rate regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments. federal or state agencies, interveners and other permitted parties may challenge our rate requests, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit our current rates or future rates we seek. although our rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year or based on future projected costs, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs 23 at any given time. our domestic regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will likely require rate increase requests to the regulators. if our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation. in addition to regulating the rates we charge, various federal and state regulatory authorities regulate many aspects of our domestic utility operations, including: the terms and conditions of our service and operations; financial and capital structure matters; siting, construction and operation of facilities; mandatory reliability and safety standards under the energy policy act of 2005 and other standards of conduct; accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies; tax matters; affiliate transactions; acquisition and disposal of utility assets and issuance of securities; and various other matters, including energy efficiency. such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties which may not be recoverable from customers. changes in transmission and wholesale power market structures could increase costs or reduce revenues. wholesale revenues fluctuate with regional demand, fuel prices and contracted capacity. changes to transmission and wholesale power market structures and prices may occur in the future, are not predictable and may result in unforeseen effects on energy purchases and sales, transmission and related costs or revenues. these can include commercial or regulatory changes affecting power pools, exchanges or markets in which our domestic utilities participate. our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs. the domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of lg&amp;e and ku) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. the completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including: approval, licensing and permitting; land acquisition and the availability of suitable land; skilled labor or equipment shortages; construction problems or delays, including disputes with third-party intervenors; increases in commodity prices or labor rates; contractor performance; environmental considerations and regulations; weather and geological issues; and political, labor and regulatory developments. failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators. we are subject to the risk that our workforce and its knowledge base may become depleted in coming years. ppl is experiencing an increase in attrition due primarily to the number of retiring employees, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed personnel due to a declining trend in the number of available skilled workers and an increase in competition for such workers. 24 risks specific to kentucky regulated segment ( ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku ) the costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are significant and are subject to continuing changes. extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to lg&amp;e's and ku's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, among other business-related activities, and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted but could be material. in addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures, operations changes, permit limitations or other restrictions. at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. market prices for energy and capacity also affect this cost-effectiveness analysis. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products and demand for our services. ongoing changes in environmental regulations or their implementation requirements and our related compliance strategies entail a number of uncertainties. the environmental standards governing lg&amp;e's and ku's businesses, particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to ongoing rulemakings and other regulatory developments, legislative activities and litigation. revisions to applicable standards, changes in compliance deadlines and invalidation of rules on appeal may require major changes in compliance strategies, operations or assets and adjustments to prior plans. depending on the extent, frequency and timing of such changes, the companies may be subject to inconsistent requirements under multiple regulatory programs, compressed windows for decision-making and short compliance deadlines that may require aggressive schedules for construction, permitting and other regulatory approvals. under such circumstances, the companies may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, delayed or incomplete rate recovery or increased costs of implementation. risks specific to pennsylvania regulated segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) we plan to selectively pursue growth of transmission and distribution capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. we plan to pursue expansion of our transmission and distribution capacity over the next several years. we plan to do this through the potential construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure. these types of projects involve numerous risks. with respect to the construction or acquisition of transmission and distribution projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. expansion in our regulated businesses is dependent on future load or service requirements and subject to applicable regulatory processes. the success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory construction contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals. if we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project. we face competition for transmission projects, which could adversely affect our rate base growth ferc order 1000, issued in july 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electric transmission planning activities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff (oatt), is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. increased competition can result in lower rate base growth. 25 we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to pennsylvania conservation and energy efficiency programs. ppl electric is subject to act 129 which contains requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposes plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing aeps. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. utilities not meeting these act 129 requirements are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. risks related to supply segment ( ppl and ppl energy supply ) we face intense competition in the competitive power generation market, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably and generate positive cash flow. our generation business is dependent on our ability to operate successfully in a competitive environment and is not assured of any rate of return on capital investments through a regulated rate structure. competition is affected by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. these competitive factors may negatively affect our ability to sell electricity and related products and services, as well as the prices that we receive for such products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow our business. we sell our available energy and capacity into competitive wholesale markets through contracts of varying duration. competition in the wholesale power markets occurs principally on the basis of the price of products and, to a lesser extent, reliability and availability. we believe that the commencement of commercial operation of new electricity generating facilities in the regional markets where we own or control generation capacity and the evolution of demand side management resources will continue to increase competition in the wholesale electricity market in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on electricity and capacity prices. we also face competition in the wholesale markets for generation capacity and ancillary services. we primarily compete with other electricity suppliers based on our ability to aggregate supplies at competitive prices from different sources and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities, isos and rtos. we also compete against other energy marketers on the basis of relative financial condition and access to credit sources, and our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. competitors in the wholesale power markets in which ppl generation subsidiaries and ppl energyplus operate include regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators, competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities and financial institutions. we are exposed to operational, price and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale and retail electricity markets. we purchase and sell electricity in wholesale markets under market-based rates throughout the u.s. and also enter into short-term agreements to market available electricity and capacity from our generation assets with the expectation of profiting from market price fluctuations. if we are unable to deliver firm capacity and electricity under these agreements, we could be required to pay damages. these damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or electricity and the contract price of any undelivered capacity or electricity. depending on price volatility in the wholesale electricity markets, such damages could be significant. extreme weather conditions, unplanned generation facility outages, environmental compliance costs, transmission disruptions and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement capacity and electricity. our wholesale power agreements typically include provisions requiring us to post collateral for the benefit of our counterparties if the market price of energy varies from the contract prices in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fulfill our potential collateral obligations under these power contracts. however, our obligation to post collateral could exceed the amount of our facilities or our ability to increase our facilities 26 could be limited by financial markets or other factors. see note 7 to the financial statements for a discussion of credit facilities. we also face credit risk that counterparties with whom we contract in both the wholesale and retail markets will default in their performance, in which case we may have to sell our electricity into a lower-priced market or make purchases in a higher-priced market than existed at the inception of the contract. whenever feasible, we attempt to mitigate these risks using various means, including agreements that require our counterparties to post collateral for our benefit if the market price of energy varies from the contract price in excess of certain pre-determined amounts. however, there can be no assurance that we will avoid counterparty nonperformance risk, including bankruptcy, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our obligations to other parties, which could in turn subject us to claims for damages. adverse changes in commodity prices and related costs may decrease our future energy margins, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. our energy margins, or the amount by which our revenues from the sale of power exceed our costs to supply power, are impacted by changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, fuel transportation, emission allowances, recs, electricity capacity and related congestion charges and other costs. unlike most commodities, the limited ability to store electricity requires that it must be consumed at the time of production. as a result, wholesale market prices for electricity may fluctuate substantially over relatively short time periods and can be unpredictable. among the factors that influence such prices are: demand for electricity; supply of electricity available from current or new generation resources; variable production costs, primarily fuel (and associated transportation costs) and emission allowance expense for the generation resources used to meet the demand for electricity; transmission capacity and service into, or out of, markets served; changes in the regulatory framework for wholesale power markets; liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, as well as general creditworthiness of key participants in the market; and weather and economic conditions affecting demand for or the price of electricity or the facilities necessary to deliver electricity. our risk management policy and programs relating to electricity and fuel prices, interest rates and counterparty credit and non-performance risks may not work as planned, and we may suffer economic losses despite such programs. we actively manage the market risk inherent in our generation and energy marketing activities, as well as our debt and counterparty credit positions. we have implemented procedures to monitor compliance with our risk management policy and programs, including independent validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, portfolio stress tests, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics. nonetheless, our risk management programs may not work as planned. for example, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management calculations. additionally, unforeseen market disruptions could decrease market depth and liquidity, negatively impacting our ability to enter into new transactions. we enter into financial contracts to hedge commodity basis risk, and as a result are exposed to the risk that the correlation between delivery points could change with actual physical delivery. similarly, interest rates could change in significant ways that our risk management procedures were not designed to address. as a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events result in greater losses or costs than our risk models predict or greater volatility in our earnings and financial position. in addition, our trading, marketing and hedging activities are exposed to counterparty credit risk and market liquidity risk. we have adopted a credit risk management policy and program to evaluate counterparty credit risk. however, if counterparties fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices. in that event, our financial results could be adversely affected. we do not always hedge against risks associated with electricity and fuel price volatility. we attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual electricity sales obligations by either reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity or purchasing the necessary financial or physical products and services through competitive markets to satisfy our net firm sales contracts. we also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and electricity purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements and other electricity-related commodities. however, based on economic and other considerations, we may decide not to hedge the entire exposure of our operations 27 from commodity price risk. to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price risk and applicable commodity prices change in ways that would be adverse to us, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. to the extent we do hedge against commodity price risk, those hedges may not ultimately prove to be effective. the accounting for our hedging activities may increase the volatility in our quarterly and annual financial results. we engage in commodity-related marketing and price-risk management activities in order to physically and financially hedge our exposure to market risk with respect to electricity sales from our generation assets, fuel utilized by those assets and emission allowances. we generally attempt to balance our fixed-price physical and financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts. these derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately recognized in earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment or the npns exception. whether a derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment depends upon it meeting specific criteria used to determine if the cash flow hedge is and will remain appropriate for the term of the derivative. specific criteria are also required in order to elect the npns exception, which permits qualifying hedges to be treated under the accrual accounting method. all economic hedges may not necessarily qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment or the npns exception, or we may elect not to utilize cash flow hedge accounting or the npns exception. as a result, our quarterly and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by changes in market prices. changes in technology may negatively impact the value of our power plants. a basic premise of our generation business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at relatively low prices. there are alternate technologies to supply electricity, most notably fuel cells, micro turbines, batteries, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells, the development of which has been expanded due to global climate change concerns. research and development activities are ongoing to seek improvements in alternate technologies. it is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternative generation to a level that is equal to or below that of certain central station production. also, as new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity usage (the "demand") by customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators. these alternative energy sources could result in a decline to the dispatch and capacity factors of our plants. as a result of all of these factors, the value of our generation facilities could be significantly reduced. the full-requirements sales contracts that ppl energyplus is awarded do not provide for specific levels of load and actual load significantly below or above our forecasts could adversely affect our energy margins. we generally hedge our full-requirements sales contracts with our own generation or energy purchases from third parties. if the actual load is significantly lower than the expected load, we may be required to resell power at a lower price than was contracted for to supply the load obligation, resulting in a financial loss. alternatively, a significant increase in load could adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of full-requirements sales contracts to provide the energy necessary to fulfill increased demand at the contract price, which could be lower than the cost to procure additional energy on the open market. therefore, any significant decrease or increase in load compared with our forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we may experience disruptions in our fuel supply, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our generation facilities. we purchase fuel and other products consumed during the production of electricity (such as coal, natural gas, oil, water, uranium, lime, limestone and other chemicals) from a number of suppliers. delivery of these fuels to our facilities is dependent upon the continuing financial viability of contractual counterparties as well as the infrastructure (including rail lines, rail cars, barge facilities, roadways, riverways and natural gas pipelines) available to serve each generation facility. as a result, we are subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at our generation facilities if fuel is unavailable at any price or if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure. disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of weather, transportation difficulties, global demand and supply dynamics, labor relations, environmental regulations or the financial viability of our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. 28 unforeseen changes in the price of coal and natural gas could cause us to incur excess coal inventories and contract termination costs. extraordinarily low natural gas prices could cause natural gas to be the more cost-competitive fuel compared to coal for generating electricity. because we enter into guaranteed supply contracts to provide for the amount of coal needed to operate our base load coal-fired generating facilities, we may experience periods where we hold excess amounts of coal if fuel pricing results in our reducing or idling coal-fired generating facilities in favor of operating available alternative natural gas-fired generating facilities. in addition, we may incur costs to terminate supply contracts for coal in excess of our generating requirements. if the services provided by the transmission facilities that deliver the wholesale power from our generation facilities are inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be materially adversely affected. furthermore, any changes in the structure and operation of, or the various pricing limitations imposed by, the rtos and isos that operate these transmission facilities may adversely affect the profitability of our generation facilities. we do not own or control the transmission facilities required to sell the wholesale power from our generation facilities. if the transmission service from these facilities is unavailable or disrupted, or if the transmission capacity infrastructure is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be materially adversely affected. rtos and isos provide transmission services, administer transparent and competitive power markets and maintain system reliability. many of these rtos and isos operate in the real-time and day ahead markets in which we sell energy. the rtos and isos that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, offer caps and other mechanisms to guard against the potential exercise of market power in these markets as well as price limitations. these types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of our generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. problems or delays that may arise in the formation and operation of maturing rtos and similar market structures, or changes in geographic scope, rules or market operations of existing rtos, may also affect our ability to sell, the prices we receive or the cost to transmit power produced by our generating facilities. rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time, which could affect our costs or revenues. as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. the ferc has issued regulations that require wholesale electricity transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that transmission capacity will not be available in the amounts we require. we cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether isos and rtos in applicable markets will efficiently operate transmission networks and provide related services. because our generation facilities are part of interconnected regional grids, we face the risk of blackout due to a disruption on a neighboring interconnected system. major electric power blackouts are possible and have occurred, which could disrupt electrical service for extended periods of time. if a blackout were to occur, the impact could result in interruptions to our operations, increased costs to replace existing contractual obligations, the possibility of regulatory investigations and potential operational risks to our facilities. additionally, in response to the blackout, there could be changes or developments in applicable regulations or market structures that could have longer-term impact on our business and results of operations. despite federal and state deregulation initiatives, our generation business is still subject to extensive regulation, which may increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or prevent or delay operation of our facilities. our generation subsidiaries sell electricity into the wholesale market. generally, our generation subsidiaries and our marketing subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the ferc. the ferc has authorized us to sell generation from our facilities and power from our marketing subsidiaries at market-based prices. the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market-based rate authority and to impose "cost of service" rates if it determines that the market is not competitive, that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates. any reduction by the ferc in the rates we may receive or any unfavorable regulation of our business by state regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations. see "regulatory issues - ferc market-based rate authority" in note 13 to the financial statements for information regarding recent court decisions that could impact the ferc's market-based rate authority program. 29 in addition, the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of electricity generation facilities require numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all required regulatory approvals. if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approval or fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the operation of our assets and our sales of electricity could be prevented or delayed or become subject to additional costs. our costs to comply with existing and new environmental and related worker health and safety laws are expected to continue to be significant, and we plan to incur significant capital expenditures for pollution control improvements that could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity or cause the continued operation of certain generation facilities to be uneconomic. our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety. numerous governmental authorities, such as the epa and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly response actions. these laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital or operating expenditures to limit or prevent releases of hazardous materials from our operations, the imposition of specific standards addressing worker protection, and the imposition of substantial liabilities and remedial obligations for pollution or contamination resulting from our operations. to comply with existing and future environmental requirements and as a result of voluntary pollution control measures we may take, we have spent and expect to spend substantial amounts in the future on environmental control and compliance. failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in joint and several, strict liability for administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non-compliance, with environmental laws, regulations and permits or for personal injury or property damage. our operations also pose risks of environmental liability due to leakage, migration, releases or spills of hazardous substances to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. certain environmental laws impose strict as well as joint and several liability (that could result in an entity paying more than its fair share) for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or solid wastes have been stored or released. we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. in addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. the trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the power generation industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. many states and environmental groups have challenged certain federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions, water discharge and intake requirements, and management of ccrs as not being sufficiently strict. as a result, state and federal regulations have been proposed or adopted that would impose more stringent restrictions, which could require us to significantly increase capital and operating expenditures for additional environmental controls. at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary environmental controls to comply with new or proposed regulations, which could cause us to retire those units. we may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for our planned capital projects which are necessary to our business. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, operations at our affected facilities could be halted, reduced or subjected to additional costs. we are subject to certain risks associated with nuclear generation, including the risk that our susquehanna nuclear plant could become subject to increased security or safety requirements that would increase capital and operating expenditures, uncertainties regarding spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties associated with decommissioning our plant at the end of its licensed life. nuclear generation accounted for about 32% of ppl energy supply's 2014 competitive power generation output. the risks of nuclear generation generally include: 30 the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses and liabilities that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives. the licenses for our two nuclear units expire in 2042 and 2044. see note 19 to the financial statements for additional information on the aro related to the decommissioning. the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing requirements, including security, safety and employee-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. in the event of noncompliance, the nrc has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. in addition, revised security or safety requirements promulgated by the nrc, particularly in response to the 2011 incident in fukushima, japan, could necessitate substantial capital or operating expenditures at our susquehanna nuclear plant. there also remains substantial uncertainty regarding the temporary storage and permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel, which could result in substantial additional costs to us that cannot be predicted. in addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our susquehanna nuclear plant, if an incident did occur, any resulting operational loss, damages and injuries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. see note 13 to the financial statements for a discussion of nuclear insurance. we plan to optimize our competitive power generation operations, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. we plan to optimize our competitive power generation operations. we plan to do this through the construction of new power plants or modification of existing power plants, and the potential closure of certain existing plants and acquisition of plants that may become available for sale. these types of projects involve numerous risks. any planned power plant modifications could result in cost overruns, reduced plant efficiency and higher operating and other costs. with respect to the construction of new plants or modification of existing plants, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. the success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals. if we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project. furthermore, we might be unable to operate any new or modified plants as efficiently as projected, which could result in higher than projected operating and other costs and reduced earnings. risks related to all segments ( all registrants ) the operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risk. numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. the operation of our generation plants, including the susquehanna nuclear plant, and of our energy and fuel trading businesses, as well as our transmission and distribution operations are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive actions, principally by terrorists or vandals, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. as a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damages to our reputation. adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. adverse economic conditions and the declines in wholesale energy prices, partially resulting from adverse economic conditions, have significantly impacted our earnings. the breadth and depth of these negative economic conditions had a wide-ranging impact on the u.s. business environment, including our businesses. in addition, adverse economic conditions also reduce the demand for electricity and natural gas and/or reduce our customers' ability to pay their bills. this reduced demand continues to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets we serve (such as pjm) and our pennsylvania and kentucky utility businesses. the combination of lower demand for power and increased supply of natural gas has put downward price pressure on wholesale energy 31 markets in general, further impacting our energy marketing results. in general, economic and commodity market conditions will continue to impact our unhedged future energy margins, utility profits, liquidity, earnings growth and overall financial condition. increases in electricity prices and/or a weak economy, can lead to changes in legislative and regulatory policy, including the promotion of energy efficiency, conservation and self-generation, which may adversely impact our business. energy consumption is significantly impacted by overall levels of economic activity and costs of energy supplies. economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs can lead to changes in or the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency and self-generation by customers. this focus on conservation, energy efficiency and self-generation may result in a decline in electricity demand, which could in turn adversely affect our business. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. credit ratings assigned by moody's and s&amp;p to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. a ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund liquidity needs and access new long-term debt at acceptable interest rates. see "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - ratings triggers" for additional information on the financial impact of a downgrade in our credit ratings. disruption in financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and access to capital, among other things, for financing capital expenditures and providing collateral to support hedging in our energy marketing business. regulations under the dodd-frank act in the u.s. and basel iii in europe may impose costly additional requirements on our businesses and the businesses of others with whom we contract, such as banks or other counterparties, or simply result in increased costs to conduct our business or access sources of capital and liquidity upon which the conduct of our businesses is dependent. we could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our credit ratings, adverse credit market conditions or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets. in the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt service and operating needs. as a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rates, credit rating considerations, insurance, security or collateral requirements, market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased availability of credit. our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of extreme weather conditions. our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold, unseasonably mild weather or severe storms occur. the patterns of these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities and the terms of our contracts to sell electricity. operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters. weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs. storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues and increase expenses, due to reduced usage and restoration costs. our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change. climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electricity. in addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, 32 such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these effects. these or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electricity, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies. reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered by consumers' preferences or market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage. we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "federal matters" in note 6 and "legal matters," "regulatory issues" and "environmental matters - domestic" in note 13 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting and reducing our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. we provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, inflation rates, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. we may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings. under gaap, we are required to test our recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. although no impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2014, we are unable to predict whether future impairment charges may be necessary. we also review our long-lived tangible and finite-lived intangible assets, including equity investments, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. see notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements for additional information on impairment charges taken and analysis performed during the reporting periods. we are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future years. we may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations. in connection with various divestitures, and certain other transactions, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities. these indemnities and guarantees relate, among other things, to liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated a divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture. see "guarantees and other assurances" in note 13 to the financial statements. 33 we are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution operations. the conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties. our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses and decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial performance. operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. these events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently and lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance costs which may not be recoverable from customers. planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us fully in the event losses occur. we are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations. changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations. we are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, property, gross receipts and franchise, sales and use, employment-related and other taxes. we also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits. due to the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered. we cannot predict whether such tax legislation or regulation will be introduced or enacted or the effect of any such changes on our businesses. if enacted, any changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we are required to obtain, and to comply with, government permits and approvals. we are required to obtain, and to comply with, numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from federal, state and local governmental agencies. the process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex and can sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which the permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. in addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals, or failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, may result in the delay or temporary suspension of our operations and electricity sales or the curtailment of our power delivery and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions. although various regulators routinely renew existing licenses, renewal could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including failure to provide adequate financial assurance for closure; failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permit conditions; local community, political or other opposition; and executive, legislative or regulatory action. our cost or inability to obtain and comply with the permits and approvals required for our operations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows. in addition, new environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed interpretations of existing laws may elicit claims that historical routine modification activities at our facilities violated applicable laws and regulations. in addition to the possible imposition of fines in such cases, we may be required to undertake significant capital investments in pollution control technology and obtain additional operating permits or approvals, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. war, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business. war, terrorist attacks and unrest have caused and may continue to cause instability in the world's financial and commercial markets and have contributed to high levels of volatility in prices for oil and gas. instability and unrest in the middle east, afghanistan, ukraine and iraq, as well as threats of war or other armed conflict elsewhere, may cause further disruption to 34 financial and commercial markets and contribute to even higher levels of volatility in prices for oil and gas. in addition, unrest in the middle east, afghanistan, ukraine and iraq could lead to acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere, and acts of terrorism could be directed against companies such as ours. armed conflicts and terrorism and their effects on us or our markets may significantly affect our business and results of operations in the future. in addition, we may incur increased costs for security, including additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppl corporation, ppl energy supply, llc, ppl electric utilities corporation, lg&amp;e and ku energy llc,

assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting at item 9a. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. in our opinion, ppl corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014, based on the coso criteria. we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company

electricity in kentucky, virginia and tennessee. ku is subject to regulation as a public utility by the kpsc, the vscc and the tra, and certain of its transmission and wholesale power activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the federal power act. ku serves its virginia customers under the old dominion power name and its kentucky and tennessee customers under the ku name. ku was incorporated in kentucky in 1912 and in virginia in 1991. (ppl) spinoff of ppl energy supply in recognition of the changes in recent years in the wholesale power markets, ppl performed an in-depth analysis of its business mix to determine the best available opportunities to maximize the value to shareowners of its competitive generation business. as a result, in june 2014, ppl and ppl energy supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of riverstone to spin off ppl energy supply and immediately combine it with riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named talen energy. the transaction was subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals from the nrc, ferc, doj and puc, all of which were received by mid-april 2015. on april 29, 2015, ppl's board of directors declared the june 1, 2015 distribution to ppl's shareowners of record on may 20, 2015 of a newly formed entity, holdco, which at closing owned all of the membership interests of ppl energy supply and all of the common stock of talen energy. immediately following the spinoff on june 1, 2015, holdco merged with a special purpose subsidiary of talen energy, with holdco continuing as the surviving company to the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of talen energy and the sole owner of ppl energy supply. substantially contemporaneous with the spinoff and merger, rjs power was contributed by its owners to become a subsidiary of talen energy. ppl's shareowners received approximately 0.1249 shares of talen energy common stock for each share of ppl common stock they owned on may 20, 2015. following completion of these transactions, ppl shareowners owned 65% of talen energy and affiliates of riverstone owned 35%. the spinoff had no effect on the number of ppl common shares owned by ppl shareowners or the number of shares of ppl common stock outstanding. the transaction is intended to be tax-free to ppl and its shareowners for u.s. federal income tax purposes. ppl has no continuing ownership interest in, control of, or affiliation with talen energy and talen energy supply (formerly ppl energy supply). see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. acquisitions on april 1, 2011, ppl, through an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, ppl wem limited, acquired all of the outstanding ordinary share capital of central networks east plc and central networks limited, the sole owner of central networks west plc, together with certain other related assets and liabilities (collectively referred to as central networks and subsequently defined herein as wpd midlands), from subsidiaries of e.on ag. wpd midlands operates two regulated distribution networks in the midlands area of england and is included in the u.k. regulated segment. segment information (ppl) ppl is organized into three reportable segments as depicted in the chart above: u.k. regulated, kentucky regulated, and pennsylvania regulated. the u.k. regulated segment has no related subsidiary registrants. ppl's other reportable segments primarily reflect the activities of its related subsidiary registrants, except that the reportable segments are also allocated certain corporate level financing and other costs that are not included in the results of the applicable subsidiary registrants. as a result of the june 1, 2015 spinoff of ppl energy supply, ppl no longer has a supply segment. 4 table of contents a comparison of ppl's three regulated segments is shown below: kentucky pennsylvania u.k. regulated regulated regulated for the year ended december 31, 2015: operating revenues (in billions) $ 2.4 $ 3.1 $ 2.1 net income (in millions) $ 1,121 $ 326 $ 252 electricity delivered (gwh) 75,907 30,814 36,984 at december 31, 2015: regulatory asset base (in billions) (a) $ 9.7 $ 8.7 $ 5.2 service area (in square miles) 21,600 9,400 10,000 end-users (in millions) 7.8 1.3 1.4 (a) represents rav for u.k. regulated, capitalization for kentucky regulated and rate base for pennsylvania regulated. see note 2 to the financial statements for additional financial information about the segments. (ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl electric has two operating segments that are aggregated into a single reportable segment. lke, lg&amp;e and ku each operate within a single operating segment. &middot; u.k. regulated segment (ppl) consists of ppl global which primarily includes wpd's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of wpd's earnings from british pound sterling into u.s. dollars, and certain costs, such as u.s. income taxes, administrative costs and allocated financing costs. wpd, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, operates four of the 15 regulated distribution networks providing electricity service in the u.k. the number of network customers (end-users) served by wpd totals 7.8 million across 21,600 square miles in south wales and southwest and central england. revenues for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2015 2014 2013 operating revenues $ 2,410 $ 2,621 $ 2,403 the majority of wpd's operating revenue is known as duos and is generated by providing regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers who pay wpd for the use of wpd's distribution network to transfer electricity to the suppliers' customers, the end-users. throughout the following discussion, the use of the term &quot;customers&quot; refers to the end-users of wpd's regulated distribution networks. franchise and licenses the operations of wpd's principal subsidiaries, wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands), are regulated by ofgem under the direction of the gas and electricity markets authority. the electricity act 1989 provides the fundamental framework of electricity companies and established licenses that require each of the dnos to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. wpd operates under a regulatory year that begins april 1 and ends march 31 of each year. wpd is authorized by ofgem to provide electricity distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. for instance, wpd is subject to ofgem regulation with respect to the regulated revenue it can earn and the quality of service it must provide, and wpd can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service. ofgem has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license. in january 2014, ofgem and wpd agreed to a reduction of &pound;5 per residential end-user in the 2014/15 regulatory year to be recovered in the 2016/2017 regulatory year. see &quot;item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview - distribution revenue reduction&quot; for additional information. ofgem has made license changes as part of the riio-ed1 process discussed below. 5 table of contents competition although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. wpd's four distribution businesses are, therefore, regulated monopolies which operate under regulatory price controls. revenue and regulation ofgem has adopted a price control mechanism that establishes the amount of base demand revenue wpd can earn, subject to certain true-ups, and provides for an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for exceeding or underperforming relative to pre-established targets. wpd's allowed revenue primarily includes base demand revenue, incentive adjustments, adjustments for over or under-recovery and adjustments related to the dpcr4 line loss close out. wpd is currently operating under the eight-year price control period of riio-ed1, which commenced on april 1, 2015. the riio framework is intended to: &middot; encourage dnos to deliver safe, reliable and sustainable network service at long-term value to customers; &middot; enable dnos to finance the required investment in a timely and efficient way; &middot; remunerate dnos according to their delivery for customers; &middot; increase emphasis on outputs and incentives; &middot; enhance stakeholder engagement including network customers; &middot; provide a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation; and &middot; replace the current low carbon network fund to continue to stimulate innovation. additionally, from a financial perspective the riio framework: &middot; regulates revenues for the dnos in real terms using 2012/2013 prices; &middot; inflates rav (therefore allowed revenues) and other revenue components using the rpi since march 31, 2013; &middot; splits the recovery of totex between immediate recovery (called &quot;fast pot&quot;) and deferred recovery as an addition to the rav (called &quot;slow pot&quot;); &middot; provides dnos with a pass-through for costs the dnos have no control over (i.e., ofgem fees, national grid transmission charges, property taxes and corporate income taxes); &middot; extends the recovery period of depreciation of rav additions after april 1, 2015 from a 20 year life as used under dpcr5 to 45 years, with a transitional arrangement that will gradually increase the asset life for new additions over the price control period resulting in an average life of approximately 35 years for rav additions during riio-ed1. the rav as of march 31, 2015 will continue to be depreciated over 20 years. the asset lives used to determine depreciation expense for u.s. gaap purposes are not the same as those used for the depreciation of the rav in setting revenues, and as such vary by asset type and are based on the expected useful lives of the assets; &middot; provides the dnos the ability to be fast-tracked through the regulatory approval process, providing a fast-track incentive of 2.5% of totex during the 8-year price control period for successful dnos; and &middot; maintains an incentive scheme for dnos to be rewarded or penalized for performance in the areas of reliability and customer satisfaction, but places a maximum cap on the amount of incentive revenues that can be earned by a dno. the key components of wpd's four riio-ed1 business plans accepted by ofgem are: &middot; all four dno business plans were accepted for fast-track status (fast-track incentive is worth approximately $43 million annually for wpd assuming a $1.60/&pound; foreign currency exchange rate); &middot; wpd received a higher level of cost savings retention, which was established at 70% for wpd compared to approximately 55% for slow-tracked dnos; &middot; a cost of debt recovery comprised of a 10-year trailing average debt allowance, to be adjusted annually, compared to a transition to a 20-year trailing average for the slow tracked dnos applied to 65% of rav; &middot; a return on regulatory equity (rore) allowance with an equity ratio of 35% of rav and a cost of equity rate of 6.4% compared to 6.0% for slow-tracked dnos; &middot; a totex split of 80% slow pot and 20% fast pot; &middot; recovery of approximately 80% of pension deficit funding for certain of wpd's defined benefit pension plans; and &middot; incentive targets that are significantly more stringent than those set under dpcr5, thus reducing the expected incentive revenues wpd can earn in riio-ed1 compared to dpcr5. wpd's combined business plans include funding for total expenditures of approximately $20.4 billion over the eight-year period (assuming a $1.60/&pound; foreign currency exchange rate), broken down as follows: 6 table of contents &middot; totex - $13.5 billion ($10.8 billion additions to rav; $2.7 billion fast pot); &middot; pension deficit funding - $2.0 billion; &middot; cost of debt recovery - $1.6 billion; &middot; property taxes, ofgem fees and national grid transmissions charges - $2.6 billion; and &middot; corporate income taxes recovery - $700 million. the u.k. regulatory structure is an incentive-based structure in contrast to the typical u.s. regulatory structure which operates on a cost-recovery model. the base demand revenue that a dno can earn in each year of the current price control period is the sum of: &middot; a return on capital from rav; &middot; a return of capital from rav (i.e. depreciation); &middot; the fast pot recovery; &middot; pension deficit funding; &middot; an allowance for cash taxes paid less a potential reduction for tax benefits from excess leverage if a dno is levered more than 65% debt/rav; &middot; certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control; &middot; certain legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods, including the information quality incentive (also known as the rolling rav incentive); &middot; fast track incentive - as wpd's four dnos were fast-tracked through the price control review process for riio-ed1, their base demand revenue also includes the fast-track incentive discussed above; &middot; profiling adjustments - these adjustments do not affect the total base demand revenue in real terms over the eight-year price control period, but change the year in which the revenue is earned; &middot; adjustments from the annual iteration process (aip), discussed further below; and &middot; adjustments for inflation true-ups, discussed further below. in addition to base demand revenue, wpd's allowed revenue primarily includes: &middot; an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for actual performance against pre-established targets; &middot; adjustments for over- or under-recovery of allowed revenue; and &middot; a reduction in revenue related to the dpcr4 line loss close out. during dpcr5, the prior price control review period, wpd's total base demand revenue for the five-year period was profiled in a manner that resulted in a weighted-average increase of about 5.5% per year for all four dnos. in the first year of riio-ed1, base demand revenue decreased by about 11.8% primarily due to a change in the profiling approach and a lower weighted-average cost of capital. for each regulatory year thereafter for the remainder of riio-ed1, base demand revenue will increase by approximately 1% per annum before inflation. as the regulatory model is incentive based rather than a cost recovery model, wpd is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by gaap. therefore, the accounting treatment of adjustments to base demand revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated based on revenue recognition and contingency accounting guidance. base demand revenue true-up mechanisms unlike prior price control reviews, base demand revenue under riio-ed1 will be adjusted during the price control period. the most significant of those adjustments are: &middot; inflation true-up - the base demand revenue for the riio-ed1 period was set in 2012/13 prices. therefore an inflation factor as determined by forecasted rpi, provided by hm treasury, is applied to base demand revenue. forecasted rpi is trued up to actuals and affects future base demand revenue two regulatory years later. this revenue change is called the &quot;tru&quot; adjustment. the projected tru for the 2015/16 regulatory year is a $45 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base demand revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by $30 million and $15 million, respectively. &middot; annual iteration process - the riio-ed1 price control period also includes an annual iteration process (aip). this will allow future base demand revenues agreed with the regulator as part of the price control review to be updated during the price control period for financial adjustments including tax, pensions and cost of debt, legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods and adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the totex incentive mechanism (tim). under the tim, wpd's dnos are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against the riio-ed1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends. the aip calculates an 7 table of contents incremental change to base demand revenue, known as the &quot;mod&quot; adjustment. the mod provided by ofgem in november 2016 will include the tim for the 2015/16 regulatory year as well as the cost of debt calculation based on the 10-year trailing average to october 2016. this projected mod of $11 million will reduce base demand revenue for calendar years 2017 and 2018 by $5 million and $6 million, respectively. as both mod and tru are changes to future base demand revenues as determined by ofgem, under applicable gaap, liabilities for these adjustments have not been recorded. ppl's projected earnings per share growth rate through 2017 includes both the estimated tru for regulatory year 2015/16 and mod. allowed revenue components in addition to base demand revenue, certain other items are added or subtracted to arrive at allowed revenue. the most significant of these are discussed below. incentives - ofgem has established incentive mechanisms to provide significant opportunities to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. some of the more significant incentive mechanisms which may affect allowed revenue include: &middot; interruptions incentive scheme (iis) - this incentive has two major components: (1) customer interruptions (cis) and (2) customer minutes lost (cmls), and both are designed to incentivize the dnos to invest and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages. the iis target under riio-ed1 is divided into interruptions caused by planned and unplanned work. the target for planned work will be calculated as the annual average level of planned interruptions and minutes lost over a previous three year period. the target for unplanned interruptions for the first year of riio-ed1 is specified in the dnos license and targets for both the cis and cmls become more demanding each year. &middot; in addition to the iis, the broad measure of customer service is enhanced in riio-ed1. this broad measure encompasses: &middot; customer satisfaction in supply interruptions, connections and general inquiries; &middot; complaints; &middot; stakeholder engagement; and &middot; delivery of social obligations. the following table shows the amount of incentive revenue, primarily from iis, which wpd has earned during dpcr5: incentive earned regulatory year ended incentive regulatory year ended (in millions) included in revenue march 2011 $ 30 march 2013 march 2012 83 march 2014 march 2013 104 march 2015 march 2014 125 march 2016 march 2015 136 march 2017 based on applicable gaap, incentive revenues are not recorded as assets and are included in revenues when they are billed to customers. dpcr4 line loss adjustment for regulatory years 2015/16 through 2018/19 allowed revenue will also be reduced to reflect ofgem's final decision on the dpcr4 line loss incentives and penalties mechanism. wpd has a liability recorded related to this future revenue reduction and, therefore, this will not impact future earnings. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. correction factor during the price control period, wpd's revenue is decoupled from volume and wpd sets its tariffs to recover allowed revenue. however, in any fiscal period, wpd's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular period. conversely, wpd could also over-recover revenue. over and under-recoveries are subtracted from or added to allowed revenue in future years, known as the &quot;correction factor&quot; or &quot;k-factor.&quot; over and under-recovered amounts arising from 2014/15 onwards and refunded/recovered under riio-ed1 will be refunded/recovered on a two year lag (previously one year). therefore the 2014/15 over/under-recovery adjustment will occur in 2016/17. in 2016/17 under this mechanism, wpd will recover the &pound;5 per residential network customer reduction 8 table of contents given through reduced tariffs in 2014/15 (approximately $56 million) as that amount is currently considered an under-recovery. historically, tariffs have been set a minimum of three months prior to the beginning of the regulatory year (april 1). in february 2015, ofgem determined that, beginning for the 2017/18 regulatory year, tariffs would be established a minimum of fifteen months in advance. therefore, in december 2015, wpd was required to establish tariffs for 2016/17 and 2017/18. this change will potentially increase volatility in future revenue forecasts due to the need to forecast components of allowed revenue including mod, tru, k-factor and incentive revenues. under applicable gaap, wpd does not record a receivable for under-recoveries, but does record a liability for over-recoveries. k-factor is measured as of the end of the regulatory year, march 31. while wpd estimates over-recoveries and records a liability when it is probable that there will be an over-recovered position at the end of the regulatory-year, weather-related volume changes and other factors such as sales mix can affect the over or under-recovery between the end of ppl's calendar year and the end of the regulatory year. see &quot;item 1a. risk factors - risks related to u.k. regulated segment&quot; for additional information on the risks associated with the u.k. regulated segment. customers wpd provides regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers (its customers) who use wpd's networks to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users. wpd bills the energy supplier for this service and the supplier is responsible for billing the end-users. ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the distribution connection and use of system agreement. this agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to collateralize its payment obligations. &middot; kentucky regulated segment (ppl) consists of the operations of lke, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of lg&amp;e and ku. in addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the kentucky regulated segment. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lg&amp;e and ku, direct subsidiaries of lke, are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky and, in ku's case, virginia and tennessee. lg&amp;e also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. lg&amp;e provides electric service to approximately 403,000 customers in louisville and adjacent areas in kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 322,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in kentucky. ku provides electric service to approximately 518,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western kentucky, approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern virginia, and fewer than ten customers in tennessee, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. ku also sells wholesale electricity to 11 municipalities in kentucky under load following contracts. in virginia, ku operates under the name old dominion power company. details of operating revenues by customer class for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2015 2014 2013 % of % of % of revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue lke commercial $ 816 26 $ 815 26 $ 770 26 industrial 628 20 627 20 587 20 residential 1,245 40 1,281 40 1,205 40 retail - other 267 9 279 9 260 9 wholesale - municipal 114 4 109 3 110 4 wholesale - other (a) 45 1 57 2 44 1 total $ 3,115 100 $ 3,168 100 $ 2,976 100 9 table of contents 2015 2014 2013 % of % of % of revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue lg&amp;e commercial $ 436 30 $ 433 28 $ 405 29 industrial 199 14 194 13 186 13 residential 633 44 650 43 614 44 retail - other 117 8 130 8 119 8 wholesale - other (a) (b) 59 4 126 8 86 6 total $ 1,444 100 $ 1,533 100 $ 1,410 100 ku commercial $ 380 22 $ 382 22 $ 365 22 industrial 429 25 433 25 401 25 residential 612 35 631 36 591 36 retail - other 150 9 149 9 141 9 wholesale - municipal 114 7 109 6 110 7 wholesale - other (a) (b) 43 2 33 2 27 1 total $ 1,728 100 $ 1,737 100 $ 1,635 100 (a) includes wholesale power and transmission revenues.

(b) this generation represents a 2.4% decrease for lke, a 13.7% decrease for lg&amp;e and a 6.6% increase for ku from 2014 output. a majority of lg&amp;e's and ku's generated electricity was used to supply its retail and municipal customer base. lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail and municipal customers. when lg&amp;e has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of ku, ku purchases electricity from lg&amp;e. when ku has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail and municipal customers and its generation cost is lower than that of lg&amp;e, lg&amp;e purchases electricity from ku. see &quot;item 2. properties - kentucky regulated segment&quot; for additional information regarding lg&amp;e's and ku's construction of a solar generating facility at the e.w. brown generating site. as a result of environmental requirements, ku retired two coal-fired units, with a combined summer capacity rating of 161 mw, at the green river plant in september 2015. lg&amp;e retired a 240 mw coal-fired unit in march 2015 and two additional coal-fired units, with a combined summer capacity rating of 323 mw, in june 2015 at the cane run plant. ku retired a 71 mw coal-fired unit at the tyrone plant in 2013. fuel supply coal is expected to be the predominant fuel used by lg&amp;e and ku for generation for the foreseeable future. due to cane run unit 7 being placed into operation during 2015, natural gas will play a more significant role going forward. the natural gas for this generating unit is purchased using contractual arrangements separate from lg&amp;e's natural gas distribution operations. natural gas and oil will continue to be used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. lg&amp;e and ku have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2022 and normally augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. for their existing units, lg&amp;e and ku expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western kentucky, southern indiana and southern illinois. lg&amp;e and ku continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from wyoming for blending at trimble county unit 2. coal is delivered to the generating plants by barge, truck and rail. to enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, lg&amp;e and ku have secured, firm long-term pipeline capacity on the interstate pipeline serving cane run unit 7 and six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the trimble county site through 2024. lg&amp;e has also secured long-term firm pipeline capacity on an interstate pipeline for an additional simple cycle gas turbine under a power purchase agreement for the summer months through october 2018. for the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at brown, no firm long-term pipeline capacity has been purchased due to the facility being interconnected to multiple pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability. natural gas purchases for these units currently take place as needed from pipelines but lg&amp;e and ku may seek to augment these purchases with longer term agreements. (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) natural gas distribution supply five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 bcf, are used in providing natural gas service to lg&amp;e's firm sales customers. by using natural gas storage facilities, lg&amp;e avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads. natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. without this storage capacity, lg&amp;e would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are typically at their highest. several suppliers under contracts of varying duration provide competitively priced natural gas. at december 31, 2015, lg&amp;e had 12 bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $42 million. 11 table of contents lg&amp;e has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying terms with a number of suppliers designed to meet its firm sales obligations. these natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. in tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. lg&amp;e purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. lg&amp;e has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by lg&amp;e between 2018 and 2021. total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 mmbtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 mmbtu/day. with this same pipeline, lg&amp;e has two contracts with a total capacity of 10,000 mmbtu/day, during the winter season and 28,000 mmbtu/day, during the summer season; both contracts have been terminated effective october 31, 2016. with this same pipeline, lg&amp;e also has a new contract for pipeline capacity commencing june 2016 through october 31, 2026, in the amount of 60,000 mmbtu/day. additionally, lg&amp;e has a contract with the same pipeline for the month of january 2016 with a total capacity of 30,000 mmbtu/day. lg&amp;e has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 mmbtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires october 31, 2018. lg&amp;e expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in south texas, east texas, north louisiana and arkansas, as well as gas originating in the rockies, marcellus and utica production areas. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) transmission lg&amp;e and ku contract with the tennessee valley authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with transerv international, inc. to act as their independent transmission operator. during 2013 through 2015, lg&amp;e and ku have submitted various compliance filings to the ferc reflecting their participation with other utilities in the southeastern regional transmission planning group relating to certain ferc order 1000 requirements. ferc order 1000, issued in july 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electric transmission planning activities. ferc approvals have been received for all but one remaining of such compliance filings. rates lg&amp;e is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc and the ferc, and ku is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc, the ferc, the vscc and the tra. lg&amp;e and ku operate under a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff (oatt). lg&amp;e's and ku's kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. as such, lg&amp;e and ku generally earn a return on regulatory assets in kentucky. ku's virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of virginia base rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. ku's tennessee base rates are established through approval of the tra and generally will follow the cost of providing service in kentucky. ku's rates to 11 municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. in april 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the original notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms. 12 table of contents &middot; pennsylvania regulated segment (ppl) consists of ppl electric, a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity. (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central pennsylvania. ppl electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers in this area as a plr under the customer choice act. details of revenues by customer class for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2015 2014 2013 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue distribution residential $ 1,338 63 $ 1,285 63 $ 1,215 65 industrial 58 3 52 3 52 3 commercial 377 18 367 18 363 19 other (a) (44) (2) 5 (11) transmission 395 18 335 16 251 13 total $ 2,124 100 $ 2,044 100 $ 1,870 100 (a) includes regulatory over- or under-recovery reconciliation mechanisms, pole attachment revenues and street lighting, offset by contra revenue associated with the network integration transmission service expense. franchise, licenses and other regulations ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. competition pursuant to authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. pursuant to the customer choice act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in pennsylvania, and ppl electric does not own or operate any generation facilities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. rates and regulation transmission ppl electric's transmission facilities are within pjm, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. pjm serves as a ferc-approved regional transmission operator (rto) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. in addition to operating the electricity transmission network, pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary objective of any rto is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the rto directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. certain types of transmission investment are subject to competitive processes outlined in the pjm tariff. 13 table of contents as a transmission owner, ppl electric's transmission revenues are recovered through pjm in accordance with a ferc approved tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula rate mechanism. as a plr, ppl electric also purchases transmission services from pjm. see &quot;plr&quot; below. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on rate mechanisms. distribution ppl electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the puc. currently, ppl electric's smart meter rider and the dsic are the only riders earning a return. certain operating expenses are also included in ppl electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes. pennsylvania's alternative energy portfolio standard (aeps) requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania. under the default service procurement plans approved by the puc, ppl electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the aeps. act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new plr generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing aeps. act 11 authorizes the puc to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a dsic. such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to ppl electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. in january 2013, ppl electric filed a petition requesting permission to establish a dsic. in may 2013, the puc approved ppl electric's proposed dsic with an initial rate effective july 1, 2013, subject to refund after hearings. the puc also assigned four technical recovery calculation issues to the office of administrative law judge for hearing and preparation of a recommended decision. in november 2015, the puc issued an opinion and order approving ppl electric's petition with minor modifications. see &quot;regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities&quot; in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129, act 11 and other legislative and regulatory impacts. plr the customer choice act requires electric distribution companies (edcs), including ppl electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the puc to act as a plr of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the plr pursuant to puc regulations. as of december 31, 2015, the following percentages of ppl electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 50% of residential, 85% of small commercial and industrial and 99% of large commercial and industrial customers. the puc continues to be interested in expanding the competitive market for electricity. see &quot;regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities - act 129&quot; in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. ppl electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period june 2015 through may 2017, which includes 4 solicitations for electricity supply held in april and october, annually. pursuant to this plan, ppl electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, large commercial and large industrial customers who elect to take that service from ppl electric. these solicitations include a mix of 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential, small commercial and small industrial customers, and 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and large industrial customers to fulfill ppl electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a plr. numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in ppl electric's service territory. since the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for ppl electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase 14 table of contents electricity supply from these alternative suppliers. see &quot;energy purchase commitments&quot; in note 13 to the financial statements for additional information regarding ppl electric's solicitations. see &quot;regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities - rate case proceedings&quot; in note 6 to the financial statements for information regarding ppl electric's 2015 rate case proceedings. &middot; other corporate functions (ppl) ppl services provides ppl subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. ppl eu services, formed in 2015, is included within the pennsylvania regulated segment and provides the majority of financial, supply chain, human resources and facilities management services to ppl electric. significant portions of the various corporate functions previously within ppl services were transferred to ppl eu services in 2015. certain other functions are to be transferred to ppl eu services as the transition services agreements with talen energy expire. ppl services will continue to provide certain limited corporate functions. for both service companies, the costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees. ppl capital funding, ppl's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of ppl and certain subsidiaries. ppl's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through ppl capital funding, that enables ppl to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of ppl's rated companies. as a result, ppl plans to further utilize ppl capital funding in future financings, in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies. unlike ppl services and ppl eu services, ppl capital funding's costs are not generally charged to ppl subsidiaries. costs are charged directly to ppl. however, ppl capital funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of lke and wpd midlands and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the kentucky regulated and u.k. regulated segments. the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other ppl capital funding securities, have been assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of ppl management's assessment of segment performance. the financing costs associated primarily with ppl capital funding's securities issuances in 2013 and beyond, with certain exceptions, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment. (all registrants) seasonality the demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. as a result, the registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or extreme winter weather make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned. see &quot;financial condition - environmental matters&quot;

&quot;our&quot; and &quot;us&quot; generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to the former ppl energy supply and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or ppl electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania regulated segment discussion, or lke and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the kentucky regulated segment discussion. (ppl) risks relating to the spinoff of ppl energy supply and formation of talen energy corporation if the spinoff of ppl energy supply does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under sections 355 and 368 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the &quot;code&quot;), including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of ppl or talen energy, then ppl and/or its shareowners may be required to pay substantial u.s. federal income taxes. among other requirements, the completion of the june 1, 2015 spinoff of ppl energy supply and subsequent combination with rjs power was conditioned upon ppl's receipt of a legal opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff will qualify as a reorganization pursuant to section 368(a)(1)(d) and a tax-free distribution pursuant to section 355 of the code. although receipt of such legal opinion was a condition to completion of the spinoff and subsequent combination, that legal opinion is not binding on the irs. accordingly, the irs could reach conclusions that are different from those in the tax opinion. if, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, the irs were to determine the distribution to be taxable, ppl would, and its shareowners could, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax liability that could be substantial. in addition, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, if the irs were to determine the merger to be taxable, ppl shareowners may, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax liability that could be material. in addition, the spinoff will be taxable to ppl pursuant to section 355(e) of the code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership (by vote or value) of either ppl or talen energy, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff. because ppl's shareowners collectively owned more than 50% of talen energy's common stock following the spinoff and subsequent combination, the combination alone will not cause the spinoff to be taxable to ppl under section 355(e) of the code. however, section 355(e) of the code might apply if acquisitions of stock of ppl before or after the spinoff, or of talen energy after the combination, were considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff. ppl is not aware of any such plan or series of transactions that include the spinoff. risks related to our u.k. segment our u.k. distribution business contributes a significant amount of ppl's earnings and exposes us to the following additional risks related to operating outside the u.s., including risks associated with changes in u.k. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions and political conditions and policies of the u.k. government and the european union. these risks may reduce the results of operations from our u.k. distribution business or affect our ability to access u.k. revenues for payment of distributions or for other corporate purposes in the u.s. &middot; changes in laws or regulations relating to u.k. operations, including rate regulations, operational performance and tax laws and regulations; &middot; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; &middot; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; &middot; regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies; &middot; changes in labor relations; &middot; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; &middot; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; &middot; changes in u.s. tax law applicable to taxation of foreign earnings; 17 table of contents &middot; compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws; and &middot; prolonged periods of low inflation or deflation. we are subject to increased foreign currency exchange rate risks because a majority of our cash flows and reported earnings are currently generated by our u.k. business operations. these risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value of the british pound sterling and the u.s. dollar between the time we initially invest u.s. dollars in our u.k. businesses, and our strategy to hedge against such changes, and the time that cash is repatriated to the u.s. from the u.k., including cash flows from our u.k. businesses that may be distributed to ppl or used for repayments of intercompany loans or other general corporate purposes. in addition, ppl's consolidated reported earnings on a gaap basis may be subject to increased earnings translation risk, which is the result of the conversion of earnings as reported in our u.k. businesses on a british pound sterling basis to a u.s. dollar basis in accordance with gaap requirements. our u.k. segment is subject to inflationary risks. our u.k. distribution business is subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in the rpi in the u.k., which is a measure of inflation. in riio-ed1, wpd's base demand revenue was established by ofgem in 2012/13 prices. base demand revenue is then increased by rpi for each year to arrive at the amount of revenue wpd can collect in tariffs. the rpi is forecasted and subject to true-up in subsequent years. the fluctuations between forecasted and actual rpi can then result in variances in base demand revenue from the business plan accepted by ofgem. while wpd also has debt that is indexed to rpi and certain components of operations and maintenance expense are affected by inflation, these may not offset changes in base demand revenue and offsets would likely affect different calendar years. further, as rav is also subject to increase in rpi, a reduction in rpi could adversely affect the debt/rav ratio together with the level of subsequent rav amortization which is an element of allowed revenue. our u.k. delivery business is subject to revenue variability based on operational performance. our u.k. delivery businesses operate under an incentive-based regulatory framework. managing operational risk and delivering agreed-upon performance are critical to the u.k. regulated segment's financial performance. disruption to these distribution networks could reduce profitability both directly by incurring costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that ofgem administers relating to customer service levels. a failure by any of our u.k. regulated businesses to comply with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by ofgem that could have an adverse impact on ppl. ofgem has powers to levy fines of up to ten percent of revenue for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may be revoked. ofgem also has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license and there can be no assurance that a restrictive modification will not be introduced in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the u.k. regulated businesses and ppl. (ppl and lke) risk related to registrant holding companies ppl and lke are holding companies and their cash flows and ability to meet their obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and ppl's ability to pay dividends, largely depends on the financial performance of their respective subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries. ppl and lke are holding companies and conduct their operations primarily through subsidiaries. substantially all of the consolidated assets of these registrants are held by their subsidiaries. accordingly, these registrants' cash flows and ability to meet debt and guaranty obligations, as well as ppl's ability to pay dividends, are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends, distributions, loans, advances or repayment of loans and advances. the subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends or distributions to their parents or to make funds available for such a payment. the ability of the registrants' 18 table of contents subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions in the future will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory requirements, including restrictions on the ability of ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku to pay dividends under section 305(a) of the federal power act. because ppl and lke are holding companies, their debt and guaranty obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of their subsidiaries. although certain agreements to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, ppl and lke and their subsidiaries retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities. therefore, ppl's and lke's rights and the rights of their creditors, including rights of debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of their subsidiaries, in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors. in addition, if ppl elects to receive distributions of earnings from its foreign operations, ppl may incur u.s. income taxes, net of any available foreign tax credits, on such amounts. (ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku) risks related to domestic regulated utility operations our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to each of the kentucky regulated segment and the pennsylvania regulated segment. set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments. the operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risks. numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. the operation of our generation plants, as well as our transmission and distribution operations, are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive actions, principally by terrorists or vandals, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. as a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to our reputation. our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments. regulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged. the rates we charge our utility customers must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the ferc, kpsc, vscc, tra and puc. although rate regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full or timely recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments. federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our current or future rate requests, structures or mechanisms, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we receive. although our rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year or on future projected costs, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. our domestic regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will likely require rate increase requests to the regulators. if our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation. in addition to regulating the rates we charge, various federal and state regulatory authorities regulate many aspects of our domestic utility operations, including: &middot; the terms and conditions of our service and operations; &middot; financial and capital structure matters; &middot; siting, construction and operation of facilities; &middot; mandatory reliability and safety standards under the energy policy act of 2005 and other standards of conduct; 19 table of contents &middot; accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies; &middot; tax matters; &middot; affiliate transactions; &middot; acquisition and disposal of utility assets and issuance of securities; and &middot; various other matters, including energy efficiency. such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties which may not be recoverable from customers. our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs. the domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of lg&amp;e and ku) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. the completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including: &middot; approval, licensing and permitting; &middot; land acquisition and the availability of suitable land; &middot; skilled labor or equipment shortages; &middot; construction problems or delays, including disputes with third-party intervenors; &middot; increases in commodity prices or labor rates; &middot; contractor performance; failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators. we are subject to the risk that our workforce and its knowledge base may become depleted in coming years. we are experiencing an increase in attrition due primarily to the number of retiring employees, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed personnel, and to attract and retain new personnel, due to a declining trend in the number of available skilled workers and an increase in competition for such workers. risks specific to kentucky regulated segment ( ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku ) the costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are significant and are subject to continuing changes. extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to lg&amp;e's and ku's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid wastes, among other business-related activities, and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted but could be material. in addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures, operational changes, permit limitations or other restrictions. at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. market prices for energy and capacity also affect this cost-effectiveness analysis. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products and demand for our services. ongoing changes in environmental regulations or their implementation requirements and our related compliance strategies entail a number of uncertainties. the environmental standards governing lg&amp;e's and ku's businesses, particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to rulemaking and other regulatory developments, legislative activities and litigation, administrative or permit challenges. revisions to applicable standards, changes in compliance deadlines and invalidation of rules on appeal may require major changes in compliance strategies, operations or assets and 20 table of contents adjustments to prior plans. depending on the extent, frequency and timing of such changes, the companies may be subject to inconsistent requirements under multiple regulatory programs, compressed windows for decision-making and short compliance deadlines that may require new technologies or aggressive schedules for construction, permitting and other regulatory approvals. under such circumstances, the companies may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, delayed or incomplete rate recovery or increased costs of implementation. we are subject to operational, regulatory and other risks regarding certain significant developments in environmental regulation affecting coal-fired generation facilities. certain regulatory initiatives have been implemented or are under development which could represent significant developments or changes in environmental regulation and compliance costs or risk associated with the combustion of coal as occurs at lg&amp;e's and ku's coal-fired generation facilities. in particular, such developments include the federal clean power plan regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions at existing or new power plants, the federal coal combustion residuals regulations governing coal by-product storage activities and the federal effluent limitations guidelines governing water discharge activities. such initiatives have the potential to require significant changes in generation portfolio composition and in coal combustion byproduct handling and disposal or water treatment and release facilities and methods from those historically used or currently available. consequently, such developments may involve increased risks relating to the uncertain cost, efficacy and reliability of new technologies, equipment or methods. compliance with such regulations could result in significant changes to lg&amp;e's and ku's operations or commercial practices and material additional capital or operating expenditures. such circumstances could also involve higher risks of compliance violations or of variations in rate or regulatory treatment when compared to existing frameworks. risks specific to pennsylvania regulated segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) we plan to selectively pursue growth of our transmission capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. we plan to pursue expansion of our transmission capacity over the next several years. we plan to do this through the potential construction or acquisition of transmission projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission infrastructure. these types of projects involve numerous risks. with respect to the construction or acquisition of transmission projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. expansion in our regulated businesses is dependent on future load or service requirements and subject to applicable regulatory processes. the success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory construction contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals. if we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project. we face competition for transmission projects, which could adversely affect our rate base growth. ferc order 1000, issued in july 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electric transmission planning activities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff (oatt), is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. increased competition can result in lower rate base growth. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to pennsylvania conservation and energy efficiency programs. ppl electric is subject to act 129 which contains requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposes plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing alternative energy portfolio standard. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. utilities not meeting these act 129 requirements are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. 21 table of contents we are or may be subject to costs of remediation of environmental contamination at facilities owned or operated by ppl electric or its former subsidiaries. we may be subject to liability for the costs of environmental remediation of property now or formerly owned by us with respect to substances that we may have generated regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during or after the time we owned or operated the facilities. we also have current or previous ownership interests in sites associated with the production of manufactured gas for which we may be liable for additional costs related to investigation, remediation and monitoring of these sites. remediation activities associated with our former manufactured gas plant operations are one source of such costs. citizen groups or others may bring litigation regarding environmental issues including claims of various types, such as property damage, personal injury and citizen challenges to compliance decisions on the enforcement of environmental requirements, which could subject us to penalties, injunctive relief and the cost of litigation. we cannot predict the amount and timing of all future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties) related to such environmental matters, although they could be material. risks related to all segments ( all registrants ) increases in electricity prices and/or a weak economy, can lead to changes in legislative and regulatory policy, including the promotion of energy efficiency, conservation and distributed generation or self-generation, which may adversely impact our business. energy consumption is significantly impacted by overall levels of economic activity and costs of energy supplies. economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs can lead to changes in or the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency, alternative and renewable energy sources, and distributed or self-generation by customers. this focus on conservation, energy efficiency and self-generation may result in a decline in electricity demand, which could in turn adversely affect our business. we could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our credit ratings, adverse credit market conditions or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets. in the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt service and operating needs. as a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rates, credit rating considerations, insurance, security or collateral requirements, market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased availability of credit. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. credit ratings assigned by moody's and s&amp;p to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. a ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund liquidity needs and access new long-term debt at acceptable interest rates. see &quot;item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - ratings triggers&quot; for additional information on the financial impact of a downgrade in our credit ratings. disruption in financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our businesses are heavily dependent on credit and access to capital, among other things, for financing capital expenditures. regulations under the dodd-frank act in the u.s. and basel iii in europe may impose costly additional requirements on the businesses of others with whom we contract, such as banks or other counterparties, or simply result in increased costs to conduct our business or access sources of capital and liquidity upon which the conduct of our businesses is dependent. our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of extreme weather conditions. our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. as a result, our 22 table of contents overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold, unseasonably mild weather or severe storms occur. the patterns of these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities. operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters. weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs. storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues and increase expenses, due to reduced usage and restoration costs. our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change. climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electricity. in addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs to prepare for or respond to these effects. these or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electricity, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies. reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered by consumers' preferences or market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage. we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in &quot;federal matters&quot; in note 6 and &quot;legal matters,&quot; &quot;regulatory issues&quot; and &quot;environmental matters - domestic&quot; in note 13 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting and reducing our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. we provide a similar level of benefits to our management employees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, inflation rates, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. we may be required to record impairment charges in the future for certain of our investments, which could adversely affect our earnings. under gaap, we are required to test our recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. although no 23 table of contents impairments were recorded based on our annual review in the fourth quarter of 2015, we are unable to predict whether future impairment charges may be necessary. we also review our long-lived tangible and finite-lived intangible assets, including equity investments, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. although no impairment charges have been recorded related to the company's continuing operations during the reporting periods, we are unable to predict whether impairment charges, or other losses on sales of other assets or businesses, may occur in future years. we may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations. in connection with various divestitures, and certain other transactions, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities. these indemnities and guarantees relate, among other things, to liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated a divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture. see &quot;guarantees and other assurances&quot; in note 13 to the financial statements. we are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution operations. the conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties. our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses and decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial performance. operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. these events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently and lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance costs which may not be recoverable from customers. planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us in the event losses occur. we are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations. changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations. we are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, property, gross receipts and franchise, sales and use, employment-related and other taxes. we also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits. due to the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered. we cannot predict whether such tax legislation or regulation will be introduced or enacted or the effect of any such changes on our businesses. if enacted, any changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we are required to obtain, and to comply with, government permits and approvals. we are required to obtain, and to comply with, numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from governmental agencies. the process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex and can sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which the permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. in addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals, or failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, may result in the delay or temporary suspension of our operations and electricity sales or the curtailment of our power delivery and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions. although various regulators routinely renew existing licenses, renewal could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including failure to provide adequate 24 table of contents financial assurance for closure; failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permit conditions; local community, political or other opposition; and executive, legislative or regulatory action. our cost or inability to obtain and comply with the permits and approvals required for our operations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows. in addition, new environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed interpretations of existing laws may elicit claims that historical routine modification activities at our facilities violated applicable laws and regulations. in addition to the possible imposition of fines in such cases, we may be required to undertake significant capital investments in pollution control technology and obtain additional operating permits or approvals, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. war, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business. war, terrorist attacks and unrest have caused and may continue to cause instability in the world's financial and commercial markets and have contributed to high levels of volatility in prices for oil and gas. in addition, unrest in the middle east could lead to acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere, and acts of terrorism could be directed against companies such as ours. armed conflicts and terrorism and their effects on us or our markets may significantly affect our business and results of operations in the future. in addition, we may incur increased costs for security, including additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident. we are subject to counterparty performance, credit or other risk in their provision of goods or services to us, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities or conduct business activities. we purchase from a variety of suppliers energy, capacity, fuel, natural gas, transmission service and certain commodities used in the physical operation of our businesses, as well as goods or services, including information technology rights and services, used in the administration of our businesses. delivery of these goods and services is dependent on the continuing operational performance and financial viability of our contractual counterparties and also the markets, infrastructure or third-parties they use to provide such goods and services to us. as a result, we are subject to the risks of disruptions, curtailments or increased costs in the operation of our businesses if such goods or services are unavailable or become subject to price spikes or if a counterparty fails to perform. such disruptions could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities or deliver our services and collect our revenues, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. the performance of coal markets and producers may be the subject of increased counterparty risk to lke, lg&amp;e and ku currently due to weaknesses in such markets and suppliers. the coal industry is subject to increasing competitive pressures from natural gas markets and new or more stringent environmental regulation, including greenhouse gases or other air emissions, combustion byproducts and water inputs or discharges. consequently, the coal industry faces raised production costs or closed customer markets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppl corporation, ppl electric utilities corporation, lg&amp;e and ku energy llc, louisville gas and electric company and kentucky utilities company reference is made to &quot;risk

responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. in our opinion, the financial

therein. we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), ppl corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) and our report dated february 19, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ ernst &amp; young llp philadelphia, pennsylvania february 19, 2016 87 table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm the board of directors and shareowners of ppl corporation we have audited ppl corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). ppl corporation and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting at item 9a. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. in our opinion, ppl corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015, based on the coso criteria. we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated

utility holding company, incorporated in 1994, in connection with the deregulation of electricity generation in pennsylvania, to serve as the parent company to the regulated utility, ppl electric, and to generation and other unregulated business activities. ppl electric was founded in 1920 as pennsylvania power &amp; light company. ppl, through its regulated utility subsidiaries, delivers electricity to customers in the u.k., pennsylvania, kentucky, virginia and tennessee; delivers natural gas to customers in kentucky; and generates electricity from power plants in kentucky. in june 2015, ppl completed the spinoff of ppl energy supply, which combined its competitive power generation businesses with those of riverstone to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named talen energy. see "spinoff of ppl energy supply" below for more information. ppl's principal subsidiaries at december 31, 2016 are shown below (* denotes a registrant). ppl corporation* ppl capital

customers under the ku name. ku was incorporated in kentucky in 1912 and in virginia in 1991. (ppl) spinoff of ppl energy supply in june 2014, ppl and ppl energy supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of riverstone to spin off ppl energy supply and immediately combine it with riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named talen energy. on april 29, 2015, ppl's board of directors declared the june 1, 2015 distribution to ppl's shareowners of record on may 20, 2015 of a newly formed entity, holdco, which at closing owned all of the membership interests of ppl energy supply and all of the common stock of talen energy. immediately following the spinoff on june 1, 2015, holdco merged with a special purpose subsidiary of talen energy, with holdco continuing as the surviving company to the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of talen energy and the sole owner of ppl energy supply. substantially contemporaneous with the spinoff and merger, rjs power was contributed by its owners to become a subsidiary of talen energy. ppl's shareowners received approximately 0.1249 shares of talen energy common stock for each share of ppl common stock they owned on may 20, 2015. following completion of these transactions, ppl shareowners owned 65% of talen energy and affiliates of riverstone owned 35%. the spinoff had no effect on the number of ppl common shares owned by ppl shareowners or the number of shares of ppl common stock outstanding. the transaction is intended to be tax-free to ppl and its shareowners for u.s. federal income tax purposes. ppl has no continuing ownership interest in or control of talen energy and talen energy supply (formerly ppl energy supply). see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. segment information (ppl) ppl is organized into three reportable segments as depicted in the chart above: u.k. regulated, kentucky regulated, and pennsylvania regulated. the u.k. regulated segment has no related subsidiary registrants. ppl's other reportable segments' results primarily represent the results of its related subsidiary registrants, except that the reportable segments are also allocated certain corporate level financing and other costs that are not included in the results of the applicable subsidiary registrants. ppl also has corporate and other costs which primarily include financing costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, as well as certain other unallocated costs. as a result of the june 1, 2015 spinoff of ppl energy supply, ppl no longer has a supply segment. 4 table of contents a comparison of ppl's three regulated segments is shown below: kentucky pennsylvania u.k. regulated regulated regulated for the year ended december 31, 2016: operating revenues (in billions) $ 2.2 $ 3.1 $ 2.2 net income (in millions) $ 1,246 $ 398 $ 338 electricity delivered (gwh) 74,728 33,006 36,645 at december 31, 2016: regulatory asset base (in billions) (a) $ 8.5 $ 8.9 $ 6.1 service area (in square miles) 21,600 9,400 10,000 end-users (in millions) 7.8 1.3 1.4 (a) represents rav for u.k. regulated, capitalization for kentucky regulated and rate base for pennsylvania regulated. for u.k. regulated, rav is lower for 2016 compared with 2015 due to the effect of foreign currency exchange rates. see note 2 to the financial statements for additional financial information about the segments. (ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl electric has two operating segments that are aggregated into a single reportable segment. lke, lg&amp;e and ku are individually single operating and reportable segments. u.k. regulated segment (ppl) consists of ppl global, which primarily includes wpd's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of wpd's earnings from british pound sterling into u.s. dollars, and certain costs, such as u.s. income taxes, administrative costs and acquisition-related financing costs. wpd, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, operates four of the 15 regulated distribution networks providing electricity service in the u.k. the number of network customers (end-users) served by wpd totals 7.8 million across 21,600 square miles in south wales and southwest and central england. revenues, in millions, for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2016 2015 2014 operating revenues $ 2,207 $ 2,410 $ 2,621 the majority of wpd's operating revenue is known as duos and is generated by providing regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers who pay wpd for the use of wpd's distribution network to transfer electricity to the suppliers' customers, the end-users. franchise and licenses the operations of wpd's principal subsidiaries, wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands), are regulated by ofgem under the direction of the gas and electricity markets authority. the electricity act 1989 provides the fundamental framework for electricity companies and established licenses that require each of the dnos to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. wpd operates under a regulatory year that begins april 1 and ends march 31 of each year. wpd is authorized by ofgem to provide electricity distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. for instance, wpd is subject to ofgem regulation with respect to the regulated revenue it can earn and the quality of service it must provide, and wpd can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service. ofgem has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license. in january 2014, ofgem and wpd agreed to a reduction of 5 per residential end-user in the 2014/15 regulatory year to be recovered in the 2016/17 regulatory year. see "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview - u.k. distribution revenue reduction" for additional information. 5 table of contents competition although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. wpd's four distribution businesses are, therefore, regulated monopolies, which operate under regulatory price controls. revenue and regulation ofgem has adopted a price control mechanism that establishes the amount of base demand revenue wpd can earn, subject to certain true-ups, and provides for an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for performance relative to pre-established targets. wpd's allowed revenue primarily includes base demand revenue (adjusted for inflation using rpi), performance incentive revenues or penalties, adjustments for over- or under-recovery from prior periods and adjustments related to the dpcr4 line loss close out. wpd is currently operating under the eight-year price control period of riio-ed1, which commenced on april 1, 2015. the riio framework is intended to: encourage dnos to deliver safe, reliable and sustainable network service at long-term value to customers; enable dnos to finance required investment in a timely and efficient way; remunerate dnos according to their delivery for customers; increase emphasis on outputs and incentives; enhance stakeholder engagement including network customers; provide a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation; and continue to stimulate innovation. additionally, from a financial perspective the riio-ed1 framework: regulates revenues for the dnos in real terms using 2012/13 prices; inflates revenue components using the rpi beginning march 31, 2013, which has the effect of inflating rav, with respect to base demand revenue; splits the recovery of totex between immediate recovery (called "fast pot") and deferred recovery as an addition to the rav (called "slow pot"); provides dnos with a general pass-through for costs over which the dnos have no control (i.e., ofgem fees, national grid transmission charges and property taxes); provides a tax allowance based on ofgem's notional tax charge, which may not equal the actual corporate tax paid; extends the recovery period for depreciation of rav additions after april 1, 2015 from a 20 year life as used under dpcr5, to 45 years, with a transitional arrangement that will gradually increase the average asset life for rav additions during riio-ed1 to approximately 35 years. the rav as of march 31, 2015 will continue to be depreciated over 20 years. the asset lives used to determine depreciation expense for u.s. gaap purposes are not the same as those used for the depreciation of the rav in setting revenues and, as such, vary by asset type and are based on the expected useful lives of the assets; provides successful dnos an incentive to be fast-tracked through the regulatory approval process, equivalent to 2.5% of totex during the 8-year price control period; and maintains an incentive scheme for dnos to be rewarded or penalized for performance in the areas of reliability and customer satisfaction, but places a maximum cap on the amount of incentive revenues that can be earned by a dno. the key components of wpd's four ofgem-accepted riio-ed1 business plans are: all four dno business plans were accepted for fast-track status (fast-track incentive is worth approximately $35 million annually for wpd assuming a $1.30/ foreign currency exchange rate); wpd received a higher level of cost savings retention, which was established at 70% for wpd compared to approximately 55% for slow-tracked dnos; a cost of debt recovery comprised of a 10-year trailing average debt allowance, to be adjusted annually, compared to a 20-year trailing average for slow-tracked dnos applied to 65% of rav; a return on regulatory equity (rore) allowance with an equity ratio of 35% of rav and a cost of equity rate of 6.4% compared to 6.0% for slow-tracked dnos; a totex split of 80% slow pot and 20% fast pot; recovery of approximately 80% of pension deficit funding for certain of wpd's defined benefit pension plans; and incentive targets that are significantly more stringent than those set under dpcr5, reducing the expected incentive revenues wpd can earn in riio-ed1 compared to dpcr5. 6 table of contents wpd's combined business plans include funding for total expenditures of approximately $16.6 billion over the eight-year period (assuming a $1.30/ foreign currency exchange rate), broken down as follows: totex - $11.0 billion ($8.8 billion additions to rav; $2.2 billion fast pot); pension deficit funding - $1.6 billion; cost of debt recovery - $1.3 billion; property taxes, ofgem fees and national grid transmissions charges - $2.1 billion; and corporate income taxes recovery - $600 million. the u.k. regulatory structure is an incentive-based structure in contrast to the typical u.s. regulatory structure, which operates on a cost-recovery model. the base demand revenue that a dno can earn in each year of the current price control period is the sum of: a return on capital from rav; a return of capital from rav (i.e., depreciation); the fast pot recovery; pension deficit funding; an allowance for cash taxes paid less a potential reduction for tax benefits from excess leverage if a dno is levered more than 65% debt/rav; certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control; certain legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods, including the information quality incentive (also known as the rolling rav incentive); fast-track incentive - because wpd's four dnos were fast-tracked through the price control review process for riio-ed1, their base demand revenue also includes the fast-track incentive discussed above; profiling adjustments - these adjustments do not affect the total base demand revenue in real terms over the eight-year price control period, but change the year in which the revenue is earned; adjustments from the annual iteration process (aip), discussed further below; and adjustments for inflation true-ups, discussed further below. in addition to base demand revenue, wpd's allowed revenue primarily includes: an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for actual performance against pre-established targets from prior periods; adjustments for over- or under-recovery of allowed revenue from prior periods; and a reduction in revenue related to the dpcr4 line loss close out. during dpcr5, the prior price control review period, wpd's total base demand revenue for the five-year period was profiled in a manner that resulted in a weighted-average increase of about 5.5% per year for all four dnos. in the first year of riio-ed1, base demand revenue decreased by about 11.8% primarily due to a change in profiling methodology and a lower weighted-average cost of capital. base demand revenue will then increase by approximately 2.5% per annum before inflation for regulatory years up to march 31, 2018 and by approximately 1% per annum before inflation for each regulatory year thereafter for the remainder of riio-ed1. as the regulatory model is incentive based rather than a cost recovery model, wpd is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by gaap. therefore, the accounting treatment of adjustments to base demand revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated based on revenue recognition and contingency accounting guidance. base demand revenue true-up mechanisms unlike prior price control reviews, base demand revenue under riio-ed1 will be adjusted during the price control period. the most significant of those adjustments are: inflation true-up - the base demand revenue for the riio-ed1 period was set in 2012/13 prices. therefore an inflation factor as determined by forecasted rpi, provided by hm treasury, is applied to base demand revenue. forecasted rpi is trued up to actuals and affects future base demand revenue two regulatory years later. this revenue change is called the "tru" adjustment. the tru for the 2015/16 regulatory year was a $40 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base demand revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by $27 million and $13 million, respectively. the projected tru for the 2016/17 regulatory year is a $6 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base demand revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by $4 million and $2 million, respectively. annual iteration process - the riio-ed1 price control period also includes an annual iteration process (aip). this will allow future base demand revenues agreed with the regulator as part of the price control review to be updated 7 table of contents during the price control period for financial adjustments including tax, pensions and cost of debt, legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods and adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the totex incentive mechanism (tim). under the tim, wpd's dnos are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against the riio-ed1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends. the aip calculates an incremental change to base demand revenue, known as the "mod" adjustment. the mod provided by ofgem in november 2016 included the tim for the 2015/16 regulatory year as well as the cost of debt calculation based on the 10-year trailing average to october 2016. this mod of $15 million will reduce base demand revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by $10 million and $5 million, respectively. the projected mod for the 2016/17 regulatory year is a $52 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base demand revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by $35 million and $17 million, respectively. as both mod and tru are changes to future base demand revenues as determined by ofgem, these adjustments are recognized as a component of revenues in future years in which service is provided and revenues are collected or returned to customers. ppl's projected earnings per share growth rate through 2020 includes both the tru and mod for regulatory year 2015/16 and the estimated tru and mod for 2016/17. allowed revenue components in addition to base demand revenue, certain other items are added or subtracted to arrive at allowed revenue. the most significant of these are discussed below. incentives: ofgem has established incentives to provide opportunities for dno's to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. some of the more significant incentives that may affect allowed revenue include: interruptions incentive scheme (iis) - this incentive has two major components: (1) customer interruptions (cis) and (2) customer minutes lost (cmls), and both are designed to incentivize the dnos to invest in and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages. the iis target under riio-ed1 is divided into interruptions caused by planned and unplanned work. the target for planned interruptions is calculated as the annual average level of planned interruptions and minutes lost over a previous three-year period. the targets for unplanned interruptions for riio-ed1 are specified in the dnos license, and targets for both the cis and cmls become more demanding each year. in addition to the iis, the broad measure of customer service is enhanced in riio-ed1. this broad measure encompasses: customer satisfaction in supply interruptions, connections and general inquiries; complaints; stakeholder engagement; and delivery of social obligations. the following table shows the amount of incentive revenue, primarily from iis, that wpd has earned during dpcr5 and riio-ed1: incentive earned regulatory year ended incentive regulatory year ended (in millions) included in revenue march 2012 $ 83 march 2014 march 2013 104 march 2015 march 2014 117 march 2016 march 2015 110 march 2017 march 2016 99 march 2018 based on applicable gaap, incentive revenues are recorded in revenues when they are billed to customers. dpcr4 line loss adjustment for regulatory years 2015/16 through 2018/19, allowed revenue will also be reduced to reflect ofgem's final decision on the dpcr4 line loss incentives and penalties mechanism. wpd has a liability recorded related to this future revenue reduction and, therefore, this will not impact future earnings. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. correction factor during the price control period, wpd sets its tariffs to recover allowed revenue. however, in any fiscal period, wpd's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular 8 table of contents period. conversely, wpd could over-recover revenue. over and under-recoveries are subtracted from or added to allowed revenue in future years, known as the "correction factor" or "k-factor." over and under-recovered amounts arising for periods beginning with the 2014/15 regulatory year and refunded/recovered under riio-ed1 will be refunded/recovered on a two year lag (previously one year). therefore, the 2014/15 over/under-recovery adjustment will occur in the 2016/17 regulatory year. under this mechanism, in the 2016/17 regulatory year, wpd will recover the 5 per residential network customer reduction given through reduced tariffs in 2014/15. as a result, revenues were positively affected by $39 million in calendar year 2016 and are projected to be positively affected by $16 million in calendar year 2017. historically, tariffs have been set a minimum of three months prior to the beginning of the regulatory year (april 1). in february 2015, ofgem determined that, beginning with the 2017/18 regulatory year, tariffs would be established a minimum of fifteen months in advance. therefore, in december 2015, wpd was required to establish tariffs for 2016/17 and 2017/18. this change will potentially increase volatility in future revenue forecasts due to the need to forecast components of allowed revenue including mod, tru, k-factor and incentive revenues. see note 1 to the financial statements for additional information on revenue recognition. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to u.k. regulated segment" for additional information on the risks associated with the u.k. regulated segment. customers wpd provides regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers who use wpd's networks to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users. wpd bills energy suppliers for this service and the supplier is responsible for billing its end-users. ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the distribution connection and use of system agreement. this agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to collateralize its payment obligations. kentucky regulated segment (ppl) consists of the operations of lke, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of lg&amp;e and ku. in addition, certain acquisition-related financing costs are allocated to the kentucky regulated segment. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lg&amp;e and ku, direct subsidiaries of lke, are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky and, in ku's case, virginia and tennessee. lg&amp;e also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. lg&amp;e provides electric service to approximately 407,000 customers in louisville and adjacent areas in kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 324,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in kentucky. ku provides electric service to approximately 521,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western kentucky, approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern virginia, and four customers in tennessee, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. ku also sells wholesale electricity to 11 municipalities in kentucky under load following contracts. details of operating revenues, in millions, by customer class for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2016 2015 2014 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue lke commercial $ 834 27 $ 816 26 $ 815 26 industrial 601 19 628 20 627 20 residential 1,261 40 1,245 40 1,281 40 retail - other 288 9 267 9 279 9 wholesale - municipal 116 4 114 4 109 3 wholesale - other (a) 41 1 45 1 57 2 total $ 3,141 100 $ 3,115 100 $ 3,168 100 9 table of contents (a) includes wholesale power and transmission revenues. 2016 2015 2014 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue lg&amp;e commercial $ 442 31 $ 436 30 $ 433 28 industrial 185 13 199 14 194 13 residential 627 44 633 44 650 43 retail - other 135 9 117 8 130 8 wholesale - other (a) (b) 41 3 59 4 126 8 total $ 1,430 100 $ 1,444 100 $ 1,533 100 (a) includes wholesale power and transmission revenues.

(b) this generation represents a 0.1% increase for lke, a 0.6% decrease for lg&amp;e and a 0.4% increase for ku from 2015 output. the majority of lg&amp;e's and ku's generated electricity was used to supply their retail and ku's municipal customer base. lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail and municipal customers. when lg&amp;e has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of ku, ku purchases electricity from lg&amp;e and vice versa. as a result of environmental requirements, ku retired two coal-fired units, with a combined capacity of 161 mw, at the green river plant in september 2015. lg&amp;e retired a 240 mw coal-fired unit in march 2015 and two additional coal-fired units, with a combined capacity of 323 mw, in june 2015 at the cane run plant. ku retired a 71 mw coal-fired unit at the tyrone plant in 2013. in june 2016, lg&amp;e and ku completed construction activities and placed into commercial operation a 10 mw solar generating facility at the e.w. brown generating site. in 2016, lg&amp;e and ku received approval from the kpsc to develop a 4 mw solar share facility to service a solar share program. the solar share program is an optional, voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the solar share facility. construction is expected to begin, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete. fuel supply coal continues to be the predominant fuel used by lg&amp;e and ku for generation for the foreseeable future. as a result of cane run unit 7 being placed into operation during 2015, natural gas is also a prominent fuel. the natural gas for this generating unit is purchased using contractual arrangements separate from lg&amp;e's natural gas distribution operations. natural gas and oil will continue to be used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. lg&amp;e and ku have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2023 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. for their existing units, lg&amp;e and ku expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western kentucky, southern indiana and southern illinois. lg&amp;e and ku continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from wyoming for blending at trimble county unit 2. coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail. to enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, lg&amp;e and ku have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity with contracts of various durations from 2019 to 2024 on the interstate pipeline serving cane run unit 7. this pipeline also serves the six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the trimble county site as well as four other simple cycle units at the cane run and paddy's run sites. lg&amp;e has also secured long-term firm pipeline transport capacity on an interstate pipeline for the summer months through october 2018 to serve an additional simple cycle gas turbine operated under a tolling agreement. for the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the e.w. brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility being interconnected to two pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability. lg&amp;e and ku have firm contracts for a portion of the natural gas fuel for cane run unit 7 for delivery in future months. the bulk of the natural gas fuel remains purchased on the spot market. 11 table of contents (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) natural gas distribution supply five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 billion cubic feet (bcf), are used in providing natural gas service to lg&amp;e's firm sales customers. by using natural gas storage facilities, lg&amp;e avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads. natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. without this storage capacity, lg&amp;e would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services can be expected to be at their highest. at december 31, 2016 , lg&amp;e had 12 bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $42 million . lg&amp;e has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. these natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. in tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. lg&amp;e purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. lg&amp;e has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by lg&amp;e between 2018 and 2021. total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 mmbtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 mmbtu/day. with this same pipeline, lg&amp;e also has another contract for pipeline capacity through 2026 in the amount of 60,000 mmbtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. lg&amp;e has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 mmbtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2018. lg&amp;e expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in south texas, east texas, north louisiana and arkansas, as well as gas originating in the marcellus and utica production areas. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) transmission lg&amp;e and ku contract with the tennessee valley authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with transerv international, inc. to act as their independent transmission operator. rates lg&amp;e is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc and the ferc, and ku is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc, the ferc and the vscc. lg&amp;e and ku operate under a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff. lg&amp;e's and ku's kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. as such, lg&amp;e and ku generally earn a return on regulatory assets in kentucky. ku's virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). as all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets. ku's rates to 11 municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). as all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets. in april 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date. rate case on november 23, 2016, lg&amp;e and ku filed requests with the kpsc for increases in annual base electricity rates of approximately $103 million at ku and an increase in annual base electricity and gas rates of approximately $94 million and $14 million at lg&amp;e. the proposed base rate increases would result in an electricity rate increase of 6.4% at ku and 12 table of contents electricity and gas rate increases of 8.5% and 4.2% at lg&amp;e. new rates are expected to become effective on july 1, 2017. lg&amp;e's and ku's applications include requests for cpcns for implementing an advanced metering system and a distribution automation program. the applications are based on a forecasted test year of july 1, 2017 through june 30, 2018 and a requested return on equity of 10.23%. a number of parties have been granted intervention requests in the proceedings. data discovery and the filing of written testimony will continue through april 2017. a public hearing on the applications is scheduled to commence on may 2, 2017. lg&amp;e and ku cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. on october 31, 2016, ku filed a request with the ferc to modify its formula rates to provide for the recovery of ccr impoundment closure costs from its departing municipal customers. on december 30, 2016, the ferc accepted the revised rate schedules providing recovery of the costs effective december 31, 2016, subject to refund, and established limited hearing and settlement judge procedures relating to determining the applicable amortization period. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms. pennsylvania regulated segment (ppl) consists of ppl electric, a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity. (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central pennsylvania. ppl electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers in this area as a plr under the customer choice act. details of revenues, in millions, by customer class for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2016 2015 2014 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue distribution residential $ 1,327 61 $ 1,338 63 $ 1,285 63 industrial 42 2 58 3 52 3 commercial 338 16 377 18 367 18

revenues and street lighting, offset by contra revenue associated with the network integration transmission service expense. franchise, licenses and other regulations ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies, which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. competition pursuant to authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. pursuant to the customer choice act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in pennsylvania, and ppl electric does not own or operate any generation facilities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. 13 table of contents rates and regulation transmission ppl electric's transmission facilities are within pjm, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. pjm serves as a ferc-approved regional transmission operator (rto) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. in addition to operating the electricity transmission network, pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary objective of any rto is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the rto directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. certain types of transmission investment are subject to competitive processes outlined in the pjm tariff. as a transmission owner, ppl electric's transmission revenues are recovered through pjm and billed in accordance with a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. under this formula, rates are put into effect in june of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in ppl electric's annual ferc form 1, filed under the ferc's uniform system of accounts. any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. as a plr, ppl electric also purchases transmission services from pjm. see "plr" below. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on rate mechanisms. distribution ppl electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the puc. currently, ppl electric's smart meter rider and the dsic are the only riders authorized to earn a return. certain operating expenses are also included in ppl electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes. pennsylvania's alternative energy portfolio standard (aeps) requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania. under the default service procurement plans approved by the puc, ppl electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the aeps. act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new plr generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing aeps. act 11 authorizes the puc to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a dsic. such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to ppl electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. ppl electric has utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in the 2015 base rate proceeding. ppl has had the ability to utilize the dsic recovery mechanism since july 2013. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129 and other legislative and regulatory impacts. plr the customer choice act requires electric distribution companies (edcs), including ppl electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the puc to act as a plr of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the plr pursuant to puc regulations. in 14 table of contents 2016, the following average percentages of ppl electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 49% of residential, 86% of small commercial and industrial and 99% of large commercial and industrial customers. the puc continues to be interested in expanding the competitive market for electricity. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities - act 129" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. ppl electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period june 2015 through may 2017, which included 4 solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in april and october. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period june 2017 through may 2021, which includes a total of 8 solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in april and october. pursuant to both the current and future plans, ppl electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential customers and commercial and industrial customers who elect to take that service from ppl electric. these solicitations include a mix of 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential and small commercial and industrial customers, and 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and industrial customers to fulfill ppl electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a plr. numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in ppl electric's service territory. since the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for ppl electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers. corporate and other (ppl) ppl services provides ppl subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. the costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees. ppl capital funding, ppl's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of ppl and certain subsidiaries. ppl's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through ppl capital funding, that enables ppl to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of ppl's rated companies. as a result, ppl plans to utilize ppl capital funding as a source of capital in future financings, in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies. unlike ppl services, ppl capital funding's costs are not generally charged to ppl subsidiaries. costs are charged directly to ppl. however, ppl capital funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of lke and wpd midlands and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the kentucky regulated and u.k. regulated segments. the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other ppl capital funding securities, have been assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of ppl management's assessment of segment performance. the financing costs associated primarily with ppl capital funding's securities issuances beginning in 2013, with certain exceptions, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment. (all registrants) seasonality the demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. as a result, the registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or extreme winter weather make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned. see "environmental matters" in note 13 to the financial statements for additional information regarding climate change. financial condition see "financial condition" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for this information. capital expenditure requirements see "financial condition -

(ppl) risks relating to the spinoff of ppl energy supply and formation of talen energy corporation if the spinoff of ppl energy supply does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under sections 355 and 368 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of ppl or talen energy, then ppl and/or its shareowners may be required to pay substantial u.s. federal income taxes. among other requirements, the completion of the june 1, 2015 spinoff of ppl energy supply and subsequent combination with rjs power was conditioned upon ppl's receipt of a legal opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff will qualify as a reorganization pursuant to section 368(a)(1)(d) and a tax-free distribution pursuant to section 355 of the code. although receipt of such legal opinion was a condition to completion of the spinoff and subsequent combination, that legal opinion is not binding on the irs. accordingly, the irs could reach conclusions that are different from those in the tax opinion. if, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, the irs were to determine the distribution to be taxable (including as a result of the subsequent acquisition of talen energy by affiliates of riverstone on december 6, 2016 (the "talen acquisition")), ppl would, and its shareowners could, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax liability that could be substantial. in addition, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, if the irs were to determine the merger to be taxable (including as a result of the talen acquisition), ppl shareowners may, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax liability that could be material. in addition, the spinoff would be taxable to ppl pursuant to section 355(e) of the code if there were a 50% or greater change in ownership (by vote or value) of either ppl or talen energy (including as a result of the talen acquisition), directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff. because ppl's shareowners collectively owned more than 50% of talen energy's common stock following the spinoff and combination with rjs power, the combination alone would not cause the spinoff to be taxable to ppl under section 355(e) of the code. however, section 355(e) of the code might apply if acquisitions of stock of ppl before or after the spinoff, or of talen energy after the combination (including the talen acquisition), were considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff. ppl is not aware of any such plan or series of transactions that include the spinoff. in connection with the closing of the talen acquisition, talen energy was required to deliver to ppl a legal opinion of tax counsel concluding that the talen acquisition would not affect the tax-free status of the spinoff. as described above, such legal opinion is not binding on the irs, and accordingly, the irs could reach conclusions that are different from those expressed in the legal opinion. risks related to our u.k. segment our u.k. distribution business contributes a significant amount of ppl's earnings and exposes us to the following additional risks related to operating outside the u.s., including risks associated with changes in u.k. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions and political conditions and policies of the u.k. government and the european union. these risks may adversely impact the results of operations of our u.k. distribution business or affect our ability to access u.k. revenues for payment of distributions or for other corporate purposes in the u.s. changes in laws or regulations relating to u.k. operations, including rate regulations, operational performance and tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; 17 table of contents regulatory reviews of tariffs for distribution companies; changes in labor relations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; changes in u.s. tax law applicable to taxation of foreign earnings; compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws; and prolonged periods of low inflation or deflation. ppl's earnings may be adversely affected as a result of the june 23, 2016 referendum in the u.k. to withdraw from the european union. significant uncertainty exists concerning the effects of the june 23, 2016 referendum in favor of the u.k. withdrawal from the european union, including the nature and duration of negotiations between the u.k. and european union as to the terms of any withdrawal. ppl cannot predict the impact, either short-term or long-term, on foreign exchange rates or ppl's long-term financial condition that may be experienced as a result of any actions that may be taken by the u.k. government to withdraw from the european union, although such impacts could be significant. we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks because a significant portion of our cash flows and reported earnings are currently generated by our u.k. business operations. these risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value of the british pound sterling and the u.s. dollar between the time we initially invest u.s. dollars in our u.k. businesses, and our strategy to hedge against such changes, and the time that cash is repatriated to the u.s. from the u.k., including cash flows from our u.k. businesses that may be distributed to ppl or used for repayments of intercompany loans or other general corporate purposes. in addition, ppl's consolidated reported earnings on a gaap basis may be subject to earnings translation risk, which is the result of the conversion of earnings as reported in our u.k. businesses on a british pound sterling basis to a u.s. dollar basis in accordance with gaap requirements. our u.k. segment is subject to inflationary risks. our u.k. distribution business is subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in rpi in the u.k., which is a measure of inflation. in riio-ed1, wpd's base demand revenue was established by ofgem in 2012/13 prices. base demand revenue is then increased by rpi for each year to arrive at the amount of revenue wpd can collect in tariffs. the rpi is forecasted and subject to true-up in subsequent years. the fluctuations between forecasted and actual rpi can then result in variances in base demand revenue. while wpd also has debt that is indexed to rpi and certain components of operations and maintenance expense are affected by inflation, these may not offset changes in base demand revenue and offsets would likely affect different calendar years. further, as rav is indexed to rpi under u.k. regulations, a reduction in rpi could adversely affect the debt/rav ratio, potentially limiting future borrowings at wpd's holding company. our u.k. delivery business is subject to revenue variability based on operational performance. our u.k. delivery businesses operate under an incentive-based regulatory framework. managing operational risk and delivering agreed-upon performance are critical to the u.k. regulated segment's financial performance. disruption to these distribution networks could reduce profitability both directly by incurring costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that ofgem administers relating to customer service levels. a failure by any of our u.k. regulated businesses to comply with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by ofgem that could have an adverse impact on ppl. ofgem has powers to levy fines of up to ten percent of revenue for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may be revoked. ofgem also has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license and there can be no assurance that a restrictive modification will not be introduced in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the u.k. regulated businesses and ppl. (ppl and lke) risk related to registrant holding companies 18 table of contents ppl and lke are holding companies and their cash flows and ability to meet their obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and ppl's ability to pay dividends, largely depends on the financial performance of their respective subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries. ppl and lke are holding companies and conduct their operations primarily through subsidiaries. substantially all of the consolidated assets of these registrants are held by their subsidiaries. accordingly, these registrants' cash flows and ability to meet debt and guaranty obligations, as well as ppl's ability to pay dividends, are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends, distributions, loans, advances or repayment of loans and advances. the subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends or distributions to their parents or to make funds available for such a payment. the ability of the registrants' subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions in the future will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory requirements, including restrictions on the ability of ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku to pay dividends under section 305(a) of the federal power act. because ppl and lke are holding companies, their debt and guaranty obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of their subsidiaries. although certain agreements to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, ppl and lke and their subsidiaries retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities. therefore, ppl's and lke's rights and the rights of their creditors, including rights of debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of their subsidiaries, in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors. in addition, if ppl elects to receive distributions of earnings from its foreign operations, ppl may incur u.s. income taxes, net of any available foreign tax credits, on such amounts. (ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku) risks related to domestic regulated utility operations our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to each of the kentucky regulated segment and the pennsylvania regulated segment. set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments. the operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risks. numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. the operation of our transmission and distribution operations, as well as our generation plants, are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive actions, principally by terrorists or vandals, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. as a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to our reputation. our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments. regulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged. the rates we charge our utility customers must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the ferc, kpsc, vscc and puc. although rate regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full or timely recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments. federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our current or future rate requests, structures or mechanisms, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we receive. although our rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year or on future projected costs, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. our domestic regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will likely require rate increase requests to the regulators. if our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 19 table of contents our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation. in addition to regulating the rates we charge, various federal and state regulatory authorities regulate many aspects of our domestic utility operations, including: the terms and conditions of our service and operations; financial and capital structure matters; siting, construction and operation of facilities; mandatory reliability and safety standards under the energy policy act of 2005 and other standards of conduct; accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies; tax matters; affiliate transactions; acquisition and disposal of utility assets and issuance of securities; and various other matters, including energy efficiency. such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties which may not be recoverable from customers. our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs. the domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of lg&amp;e and ku) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. the completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including: approval, licensing and permitting; land acquisition and the availability of suitable land; skilled labor or equipment shortages; construction problems or delays, including disputes with third-party intervenors; increases in commodity prices or labor rates; contractor performance; failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators. we are subject to the risk that our workforce and its knowledge base may become depleted in coming years. we are experiencing an increase in attrition due primarily to the number of retiring employees, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed personnel, and to attract and retain new personnel, due to a declining trend in the number of available skilled workers and an increase in competition for such workers. we are or may be subject to costs of remediation of environmental contamination at facilities owned or operated by our former subsidiaries. we may be subject to liability for the costs of environmental remediation of property now or formerly owned by us with respect to substances that we may have generated regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during or after the time we owned or operated the facilities. we also have current or previous ownership interests in sites associated with the production of manufactured gas for which we may be liable for additional costs related to investigation, remediation and monitoring of these sites. remediation activities associated with our former manufactured gas plant operations are one source of such costs. citizen groups or others may bring litigation regarding environmental issues including claims of various types, such as property damage, personal injury and citizen challenges to compliance decisions on the enforcement of environmental requirements, which could subject us to penalties, injunctive relief and the cost of litigation. we cannot predict the amount and timing of all future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties) related to such environmental matters, although they could be material. risks specific to kentucky regulated segment 20 table of contents ( ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku ) the costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are significant and are subject to continuing changes. extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to lg&amp;e's and ku's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid wastes, among other business-related activities, and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted but could be material. in addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures, operational changes, permit limitations or other restrictions. at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. market prices for energy and capacity also affect this cost-effectiveness analysis. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products and demand for our services. ongoing changes in environmental regulations or their implementation requirements and our related compliance strategies entail a number of uncertainties. the environmental standards governing lg&amp;e's and ku's businesses, particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to rulemaking and other regulatory developments, legislative activities and litigation, administrative or permit challenges. revisions to applicable standards, changes in compliance deadlines and invalidation of rules on appeal may require major changes in compliance strategies, operations or assets and adjustments to prior plans. depending on the extent, frequency and timing of such changes, the companies may be subject to inconsistent requirements under multiple regulatory programs, compressed windows for decision-making and short compliance deadlines that may require new technologies or aggressive schedules for construction, permitting and other regulatory approvals. under such circumstances, the companies may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, delayed or incomplete rate recovery or increased costs of implementation. we are subject to operational, regulatory and other risks regarding certain significant developments in environmental regulation affecting coal-fired generation facilities. certain regulatory initiatives have been implemented or are under development which could represent significant developments or changes in environmental regulation and compliance costs or risk associated with the combustion of coal as occurs at lg&amp;e's and ku's coal-fired generation facilities. in particular, such developments include the federal clean power plan regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions at existing or new generation facilities, the federal coal combustion residuals regulations governing coal by-product storage activities and the federal effluent limitations guidelines governing water discharge activities. such initiatives have the potential to require significant changes in generation portfolio composition and in coal combustion byproduct handling and disposal or water treatment and release facilities and methods from those historically used or currently available. consequently, such developments may involve increased risks relating to the uncertain cost, efficacy and reliability of new technologies, equipment or methods. compliance with such regulations could result in significant changes to lg&amp;e's and ku's operations or commercial practices and material additional capital or operating expenditures. such circumstances could also involve higher risks of compliance violations or of variations in rate or regulatory treatment when compared to existing frameworks. risks specific to pennsylvania regulated segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) we plan to selectively pursue growth of our transmission capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. we plan to pursue expansion of our transmission capacity over the next several years. we plan to do this through the potential construction or acquisition of transmission projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission infrastructure. these types of projects involve numerous risks. with respect to the construction or acquisition of transmission projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. expansion in our regulated businesses is dependent on future load or service requirements and subject to applicable regulatory processes. the success of 21 table of contents both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory construction contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals. if we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project. we face competition for transmission projects, which could adversely affect our rate base growth. ferc order 1000, issued in july 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electric transmission planning activities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. increased competition can result in lower rate base growth. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to pennsylvania conservation and energy efficiency programs. ppl electric is subject to act 129 which contains requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposes plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing alternative energy portfolio standard. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. utilities not meeting these act 129 requirements are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. risks related to all segments ( all registrants ) increases in electricity prices and/or a weak economy, can lead to changes in legislative and regulatory policy, including the promotion of energy efficiency, conservation and distributed generation or self-generation, which may adversely impact our business. energy consumption is significantly impacted by overall levels of economic activity and costs of energy supplies. economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs can lead to changes in or the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency, alternative and renewable energy sources, and distributed or self-generation by customers. this focus on conservation, energy efficiency and self-generation may result in a decline in electricity demand, which could adversely affect our business. we could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our credit ratings, adverse credit market conditions or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets. in the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt service and operating needs. as a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rates, credit rating considerations, insurance, security or collateral requirements, market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased availability of credit. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. credit ratings assigned by moody's and s&amp;p to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. a ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund liquidity needs and access new long-term debt at acceptable interest rates. see "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - ratings triggers" for additional information on the financial impact of a downgrade in our credit ratings. our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of extreme weather conditions. our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions such as heat waves, extreme cold, 22 table of contents unseasonably mild weather or severe storms occur. the patterns of these fluctuations may change depending on the type and location of our facilities. operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters. weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs. storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues and increase expenses, due to reduced usage and restoration costs. our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change. climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electricity. in addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs to prepare for or respond to these effects. these or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electricity, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies. reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered by consumers' preferences or market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage. we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "federal matters" in note 6 and "legal matters," "regulatory issues" and "environmental matters - domestic" in note 13 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting and reducing our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, inflation rates, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. we may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations. in connection with various divestitures, and certain other transactions, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities. these indemnities and guarantees relate, among other things, to liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated a divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture. see "guarantees and other assurances" in note 13 to the financial statements. 23 table of contents we are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution operations. the conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties. our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses and decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial performance. operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. these events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently and lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance costs, which may not be recoverable from customers. planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us in the event losses occur. we are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations. changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations. we are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, property, gross receipts and franchise, sales and use, employment-related and other taxes. we also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits. due to the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered. we cannot predict whether such tax legislation or regulation will be introduced or enacted or the effect of any such changes on our businesses. if enacted, any changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we are required to obtain, and to comply with, government permits and approvals. we are required to obtain, and to comply with, numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from governmental agencies. the process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex and can sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which the permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. in addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals, or failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, may result in the delay or temporary suspension of our operations and electricity sales or the curtailment of our power delivery and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions. although various regulators routinely renew existing licenses, renewal could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including failure to provide adequate financial assurance for closure; failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permit conditions; local community, political or other opposition; and executive, legislative or regulatory action. our cost or inability to obtain and comply with the permits and approvals required for our operations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows. in addition, new environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed interpretations of existing laws may elicit claims that historical routine modification activities at our facilities violated applicable laws and regulations. in addition to the possible imposition of fines in such cases, we may be required to undertake significant capital investments in pollution control technology and obtain additional operating permits or approvals, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. war, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business. war, terrorist attacks and unrest have caused and may continue to cause instability in the world's financial and commercial markets and have contributed to high levels of volatility in prices for oil and gas. in addition, unrest in the middle east could lead to acts of terrorism in the united states, the united kingdom or elsewhere, and acts of terrorism could be directed against companies such as ours. armed conflicts and terrorism and their effects on us or our markets may significantly affect our business and results of operations in the future. in addition, we may incur increased costs for security, including additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a

internal control over financial reporting of ppl corporation and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2016, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting at item 9a. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the

about the segments. (ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl electric has two operating segments that are aggregated into a single reportable segment. lke, lg&amp;e and ku are individually single operating and reportable segments. u.k. regulated segment (ppl) consists of ppl global, which primarily includes wpd's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of wpd's earnings from british pound sterling into u.s. dollars, and certain costs, such as u.s. income taxes, administrative costs and acquisition-related financing costs. 4 table of contents wpd operates four of the 14 ofgem regulated dnos providing electricity service in the u.k. through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries: wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands). the number of network customers (end-users) served by wpd totals 7.9 million across 21,600 square miles in south wales and southwest and central england. revenues, in millions, for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2017 2016 2015 operating revenues (a) $ 2,091 $ 2,207 $ 2,410 (a) wpd's operating revenues are translated from gbp to u.s. dollars using the average gbp to u.s. dollar exchange rates in effect each month. the annual weighted average of the monthly gbp to u.s. dollar exchange rates used for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1.28 per gbp, $1.37 per gbp and $1.53 per gbp. franchise and licenses wpd's operations are regulated by ofgem under the direction of the gas and electricity markets authority. ofgem is a non-ministerial government department and an independent national regulatory authority that is responsible for protecting the interests of existing and future electricity and natural gas consumers. the electricity act 1989 provides the fundamental framework for electricity companies and established licenses that require each of the dnos to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. wpd's operations are regulated under these licenses which set the outputs wpd needs to deliver for their customers and associated revenues wpd is allowed to earn. wpd operates under a regulatory year that begins april 1 and ends march 31 of each year. ofgem has the formal power to propose modifications to each distribution license; however licensees can appeal such changes to the u.k.'s competition and markets authority in the event of a disagreement with the regulator. generally, any potential changes to these licenses are reviewed with stakeholders in a formal regulatory consultation process prior to a formal change proposal. competition although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. wpd's four distribution businesses are, therefore, regulated monopolies, which operate under regulatory price controls. customers wpd provides regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers who use wpd's networks to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users. wpd bills energy suppliers for this service and the supplier is responsible for billing its end-users. ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the distribution connection and use of system agreement. this agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to collateralize its payment obligations. wpd's costs make up approximately 16% of a u.k. end-user customer's electricity bill. u.k. regulation and rates overview ofgem has adopted a price control regulatory framework with a balanced objective of enhancing and developing electricity networks for the future, controlling costs to customers and allowing dnos, such as wpd's dnos, to earn a fair return on their investments. this regulatory structure is focused on outputs and performance in contrast to traditional u.s. utility ratemaking that operates under a cost recovery model. price controls are established based on long-term business plans developed by each dno with substantial input from its stakeholders. to measure the outputs and performance, each dno business plan includes incentive targets that allow for increases and/or reductions in revenues based on operational performance, which are intended to align returns with quality of service, innovation and customer satisfaction. for comparative purposes, amounts listed below are in british pounds sterling, nominal prices and in calendar years unless otherwise noted. 5 table of contents key ratemaking mechanisms ppl believes the u.k. electricity utility model is a premium jurisdiction in which to do business due to its significant stakeholder engagement, incentive-based structure and high-quality ratemaking mechanisms. current price control: riio-ed1 wpd is currently operating under an eight-year price control period called riio-ed1, which commenced for electricity distribution companies on april 1, 2015. the regulatory framework is based on an updated approach for sustainable network regulation known as the "riio" model where revenue = incentives + innovation + outputs. the riio framework allows for a mpr, which is a review halfway through the price control period to assess potential changes in outputs during the price control period. the scope of the potential mpr was originally limited to material changes to outputs that can be justified by clear changes in government policy and the introduction of new outputs that are needed to meet the needs of consumers and other network users. ofgem is currently consulting on the scope of the potential mpr. see "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview - financial and operational developments - regulatory requirements" for additional information. in coordination with numerous stakeholders, wpd developed its business plans for riio-ed1 building off its historical track record and long-term strategy of delivering industry-leading levels of performance at an efficient level of cost. as a result, all four of wpd's dnos' business plans were accepted by ofgem as "well justified" and were "fast-tracked" ahead of all of the other dnos. wpd's dnos were rewarded for being fast-tracked with preferential financial incentives, a higher return on equity and higher cost savings retention under their business plans as discussed further below. wpd's combined riio-ed1 business plans include funding for total expenditures of approximately 12.8 billion (nominal) over the eight-year period, broken down as follows: totex - 8.5 billion ( 6.8 billion recovered as additions to rav over time ("slow pot"); 1.7 billion recovered in the year spent in the plan ("fast pot")); pension deficit funding - 1.2 billion; cost of debt recovery - 1.0 billion; pass through charges - 1.6 billion (property taxes, ofgem fees and national grid transmissions charges); and corporate income taxes recovery - 0.5 billion. the chart below illustrates the building blocks of allowed revenue and gaap net income for the u.k. regulated segment. the revenue components are shown in either 2012/13 prices or nominal prices, consistent with the formulas ofgem established for riio-ed1. the reference numbers included in each block correspond with the descriptions that follow. (a) primarily pension deficit funding, pass through costs, profiling adjustments and legacy price control adjustments. (b) primarily pass through true-ups and 5 per residential customer reduction. 6 table of contents (c) reference form 8-k filed february 22, 2018 for u.k. regulated segment gaap statement of income component values. (d) includes gaap pension costs/income (see defined benefits, net periodic defined benefit costs (credits) in note 11 to the financial statements). (e) primarily property taxes. (f) primarily gains and losses on foreign currency hedges. (g) includes wpd interest and $32 million of allocated interest expense to finance the acquisition of wpd midlands. (h) gaap income taxes represent an effective tax rate of 19% for 2017, 16% for 2016 and approximately 17% going forward. (1) base revenue the base revenue that a dno can collect in each year of the current price control period is the sum of the following which are discussed further below: a return on capital from rav; a return of capital from rav (i.e., depreciation); the fast pot recovery, see discussion (4) expenditure efficiency mechanisms below; an allowance for cash taxes paid less a potential reduction for tax benefits from excess leverage if a dno is levered more than 65% debt/rav; pension deficit funding certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control; profiling adjustments, see discussion (6) other revenue included in base revenue below; certain legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods, including the information quality incentive (also known as the rolling rav incentive); and fast-track incentive - because wpd's four dnos were fast-tracked through the price control review process for riio-ed1, their base demand revenue also includes the fast-track incentive. (2) real return on capital from rav real-time returns on cost of regulated equity (real) - ofgem establishes an allowed return on regulated equity that dnos earn in their base business plan revenues as a consideration of the financial parameters for each riio-ed1 business plan. for wpd, the base cost of equity collected in revenues was set at 6.4% (real). base equity returns exclude inflation adjustments, allowances for incentive rewards/penalties and over/under collections driven by cost efficiencies. wpd's base equity returns are calculated using an equity ratio of 35% of rav at the dno. the equity ratio was reviewed and set during the riio-ed1 business plan process taking various stakeholder impacts into consideration such as costs to consumers, credit ratings and investor needs. the amounts of base real equity return, for 2017 and 2016 were 151 million and 144 million. indexed cost of debt recovery (real) - as part of wpd's fast-track agreement with ofgem for riio-ed1, wpd collects in revenues an assumed real cost of debt that is derived from a historical 10-year bond index (iboxx) and adjusted annually for inflation. this calculated real cost of debt is then applied to 65% of rav at the dnos to determine the cost of debt revenue recovery. the cost of debt was set at 2.55% in the original "well justified" business plans. the recovery amounts are trued up annually as a component of the mod true-up mechanism described within " (9) mod and inflation true-up (tru) " below. actual interest expense is reflective of prior financing activities and any financing required to fund capital expenditures. therefore, the amount collected in revenues may differ from the actual interest expense recorded in the statements of income. currently, wpd is under-recovering its dno-related interest expense and is expected to continue to under-recover through the remainder of riio-ed1. interest costs relating to debt issued at wpd's holding companies are not recovered in revenues and for 2017 and 2016 were approximately 49 million and 54 million. (3) recovery of depreciation in revenues - recovery of depreciation in regulatory revenues is one of the key mechanisms ofgem uses to support financeable business plans that provide incentives to attract the continued substantial investment required in the u.k. differences between gaap and regulatory depreciation exist primarily due to differing assumptions on asset lives and because rav is adjusted for inflation using rpi. compared to asset lives established for gaap, asset lives established for ratemaking are set by ofgem based on economic lives which results in improved near-term revenues and cash flows for dnos during investment cycles. under u.k. regulation prior to riio-ed1, electric distribution assets were depreciated on a 20-year asset life for the purpose of setting revenues. after review and consultation, ofgem decided to use 45-year asset lives for rav additions after april 1, 2015, with transitional arrangements available for dnos that fully demonstrated a need to ensure a financeable plan. wpd adopted a transition that 7 table of contents has a linear increase in asset lives from 20 to 45 years for additions to rav in each year of riio-ed1 (with additions averaging a life of approximately 35 years over this period), which adds support to its credit metrics. rav additions prior to march 31, 2015 continue to be recovered in revenues over 20 years. the asset lives used to determine depreciation expense for gaap purposes are not the same as those used for the depreciation of the rav in setting revenues and, as such, vary by asset type and are based on the expected useful lives of the assets. effective january 1, 2015 after completing a review of the useful lives of its distribution network assets, wpd set the weighted average useful lives to 69 years for gaap depreciation expense. because ofgem uses a real cost of capital, the rav and recovery of depreciation are adjusted for inflation using rpi. the inflation revenues collected in this line item help recover the cost of equity and debt returns on a "nominal" basis, compared to the "real" rates used to set the return component of base revenues. this regulatory construct, in combination with the different assets lives used for ratemaking and gaap, results in amounts collected by wpd as recovery of depreciation in revenues being significantly higher than the amounts wpd recorded for depreciation expense under gaap. for 2017 and 2016, this difference was 424 million and 415 million (pre-tax) and positively impacted net income. we expect this difference to continue in the 400 million to 450 million (pre-tax) range at least through 2022 (the last full calendar year of riio-ed1) assuming rpi of approximately 3.0% per year from 2018 through 2022 and based on expected rav additions of approximately 800 million per year to prepare the distribution system for future u.k. energy objectives while maintaining premier levels of reliability and customer service. (4) expenditure efficiency mechanisms - ofgem introduced the concept of totex in riio to ensure all dnos face equal incentives in choosing between operating and capital solutions. totex is split between immediate recovery (called "fast pot") and deferred recovery as an addition to the rav (called "slow pot"). the ratio of slow pot to fast pot was determined by each dno in their business plan development. wpd established a totex split of 80% slow pot and 20% fast pot for riio-ed1 to balance maximizing rav growth with immediate cost recovery to support investment grade credit ratings. comparatively, other dnos on average used a ratio of approximately 70% slow pot and 30% fast pot for riio-ed1. ofgem also allows a totex incentive mechanism that is intended to reward dnos for cost efficiency. wpd's dnos are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against its riio-ed1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends. any amounts to be returned to customers are trued up in the aip discussed below. because fast pot cost recovery represents 20% of totex expenditures and certain other costs are recovered in other aspects of revenue, fast pot will not equal operation and maintenance expenses recorded for gaap purposes. (5) income tax allowance - for price control purposes, wpd collects income tax based on ofgem's notional tax charge, which will not equal the amount of income tax expense recorded for gaap purposes. the following table shows the amount of taxes collected in revenues and recorded under gaap. 2017 2016 taxes collected in revenues 57 53 taxes recorded under gaap 139 119 (6) other revenue included in base revenue - other revenue included in base revenue primarily consists of pension deficit funding, pass through costs, profiling adjustments and legacy price control adjustments. recovery of annual (normal) pension cost and pension deficit funding - ofgem allows dnos to recover annual (normal) pension costs through the totex allocation, split between the previously described fast pot (immediate recovery) and slow pot recovery (as an addition to rav). the amount of normal pension cost is computed by the pension trustees, using assumptions that differ from those used in calculating pension costs/income under gaap. in addition, the timing of the revenue collection may not match the actual pension payment schedule, resulting in a timing difference of cash flows. in addition, wpd recovers approximately 80% of pension deficit funding for certain of wpd's defined benefit pension plans in conjunction with actual costs similar to the fast pot mechanism. the pension deficit is determined by the pension trustees on a triennial basis in accordance with their funding requirements. pension deficit funding recovered in revenues was 142 million and 139 million in 2017 and 2016. see note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on pension costs/income recognized under gaap. 8 table of contents recovery of pass through costs - wpd recovers certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control such as property taxes, national grid transmission charges and ofgem fees. although these items are intended to be pass-through charges there could be timing differences, primarily related to property taxes, as to when amounts are collected in revenues and when amounts are expensed in the statements of income. wpd over-collected property taxes by 19 million and 8 million in 2017 and 2016. wpd expects to continue to over-recover property taxes until the end of riio-ed1. amounts under-or over-recovered in revenues in a regulatory year are trued up through revenues two regulatory years later. profiling adjustments - ofgem permitted dnos the flexibility to make profiling adjustments to their base revenues within their business plans. these adjustments do not affect the total base revenue in real terms over the eight-year price control period, but change the year in which the revenue is collected. in the first year of riio-ed1, wpd's base revenue decreased by 11.8% compared to the final year of the prior price control period (dpcr5), primarily due to a change in profiling methodology and a lower weighted-average cost of capital. base revenue then increases by approximately 2.5% per annum before inflation for regulatory years up to march 31, 2018 and by approximately 1% per annum before inflation for each regulatory year thereafter for the remainder of riio-ed1. (7) incentives for developing high-quality business plans (known as fast-tracking) - for riio-ed1, ofgem incentivized dnos with certain financial rewards to develop "well justified" business plans that drive value to customers. wpd was awarded the following incentives for being fast-tracked by ofgem: an annual fast-track revenue incentive worth 2.5% of totex (approximately 25 million annually for wpd); a real cost of equity rate of 6.4% compared to 6.0% for slow-tracked dnos; and, cost savings retention was established at 70% for wpd compared to approximately 55% for slow-tracked dnos. (8) allowed revenue - allowed revenue is the amount that a dno can collect from its customers in order to fund its investment requirements. base revenues are adjusted annually during riio-ed1 to arrive at allowed revenues. these adjustments are discussed in sections (9) through (13) below. (9) mod and inflation true-up (tru) mod - riio-ed1 includes an aip that allows future base revenues, agreed with the regulator as part of the price control review, to be updated during the price control period for financial adjustments including taxes, pensions, cost of debt, legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods and adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the totex incentive mechanism (tim). the aip calculates an incremental change to base revenue, known as the "mod" adjustment. the mod provided by ofgem in november 2016 included the tim for the 2015/16 regulatory year, as well as the cost of debt calculation based on the 10-year trailing average to october 2016. this mod of 12 million reduced base revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by 8 million and 4 million. the mod provided by ofgem in november 2017 for the 2016/17 regulatory year is a 39 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by 26 million and 13 million. the projected mod for the 2017/18 regulatory year is a 45 million reduction to revenue and is expected to reduce base revenue in calendar years 2019 and 2020 by 30 million and 15 million. tru - as discussed below in " (10) inflation adjusted, multi-year rate cycle ," the base revenue for the riio-ed1 period was set based on 2012/13 prices. therefore an inflation factor as determined by forecasted rpi, provided by hm treasury, is applied to base revenue. forecasted rpi is trued up to actuals and affects future base revenue two regulatory years later. this revenue change is called the "tru" adjustment. the tru for the 2015/16 regulatory year was a 31 million reduction to revenue and reduced base revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by 21 million and 10 million. the tru for the 2016/17 regulatory year was a 6 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by 4 million and 2 million. the projected tru for the 2017/18 regulatory year is a 5 million increase to revenue and is expected to increase base revenue in calendar years 2019 and 2020 by 3 million and 2 million. 9 table of contents as both mod and tru are changes to future base revenues as determined by ofgem, these adjustments are recognized as a component of revenues in future years in which service is provided and revenues are collected or returned to customers. ppl's projected earnings per share growth rate through 2020 includes both the tru and mod for regulatory years 2015/16 and 2016/17 and the estimated tru and mod for 2017/18. (10) inflation adjusted, multi-year rate cycle - ofgem built its price control framework to better coincide with the long-term nature of electricity distribution investments. the current price control for electricity distribution is for the eight-year period from april 1, 2015 through march 31, 2023. this both required and enabled wpd to design a base business plan with predictable revenues and expenses over the long-term to drive value for its customers through predetermined outputs and for its investors through preset base returns. a key aspect to the multi-year cycle is an annual inflation adjustment for revenue and cost components, which are inflated using rpi from the base 2012/13 prices used to establish the business plans. consistent with ofgem's formulas, the inflation adjustment is applied to base revenue, mod and tru when determining allowed revenue. this inflation adjustment also has the effect of inflating rav, and real returns are earned on the inflated rav. (11) incentive revenues for strong operational performance and innovation - ofgem has established incentives to provide opportunities for dnos to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. these incentives can result in an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for actual performance against pre-established targets based on past performance. some of the more significant incentives that may affect allowed revenue include the interruptions incentive scheme (iis), the broad measure of customer service (bmcs) and the time to connect (ttc) incentive: the iis has two major components: (1) customer interruptions (cis) and (2) customer minutes lost (cmls), and both are designed to incentivize the dnos to invest in and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages. the bmcs encompasses customer satisfaction in supply interruptions, connections and general inquiries, complaints, stakeholder engagement and delivery of social obligations. the ttc incentive rewards dnos for reducing connection times for minor connections against an ofgem set target. the annual incentives and penalties are reflected in customer rates on a two-year lag from the time they are earned and/or assessed. based on applicable gaap, incentive revenues and penalties are recorded in revenues when they are billed to customers. the following table shows the amount of incentive revenues (in total), primarily from iis, bmcs and ttc that wpd has received and is projected to receive on a calendar year basis: incentive received calendar year ended incentive calendar year ended incentive earned (in millions) included in revenue 2014 83 2016 2015 79 2017 2016 76 2018 2017 (a) 65-80 2019 2018 (a) 70-85 2020 (a) reflects projected incentive revenues. (12) correction factor (k-factor) - during the price control period, wpd sets its tariffs to recover allowed revenue. however, in any fiscal period, wpd's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular period. conversely, wpd could over-recover revenue. over- and under-recoveries are subtracted from or added to allowed revenue in future years, known as the "correction factor" or "k-factor." over and under-recovered amounts during riio-ed1 will be refunded/recovered two regulatory years later. the k-factors created in the 2016/17 and 2015/16 regulatory years were not significant. historically, tariffs have been set a minimum of three months prior to the beginning of the regulatory year (april 1). in february 2015, ofgem determined that, beginning with the 2017/18 regulatory year, tariffs would be established a minimum of fifteen months in advance. therefore, in december 2015, wpd was required to establish tariffs for the 2016/17 and 2017/18 regulatory years. this change will potentially increase volatility in future revenue forecasts due to the need to forecast components of allowed revenue including mod, tru, k-factor and incentive revenues. 10 table of contents (13) other allowed revenue - other allowed revenue primarily consists of pass through true-ups and 5 per residential customer reduction. for a discussion on property tax true-ups, see recovery of pass through costs in " (6) other revenue included in base revenue " above. in the 2016/17 regulatory year, wpd recovered a 5 per residential network customer reduction given through reduced tariffs in 2014/15. as a result, revenues were positively affected in calendar years 2017 and 2016 by 13 million and 25 million. (14) gaap operating revenue - operating revenue under gaap primarily consists of allowed revenue that has been collected in the calendar year converted to u.s. dollars. it also includes miscellaneous revenue primarily from engineering recharge work and ancillary activity revenue. engineering recharge is work performed for a third party by wpd which is not for general network maintenance or to increase reliability. examples are diversions and running new lines and equipment for a new housing complex. ancillary activity revenue includes revenue primarily from wpd's telecoms and property companies. for additional information on ancillary activity revenue, see footnote c in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operation - reconciliation of margins." the amounts of miscellaneous revenue for 2017 and 2016 were 90 million and 84 million, however, the margin or profit on these activities was not significant. (15) currency hedging - earnings generated by ppl's u.k. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. due to the significant earnings contributed from wpd, ppl enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the gbp versus the u.s. dollar. these hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under gaap. see "overview- financial and operational developments - u.k. membership in european union" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for a discussion of u.k. earnings hedging activity. gaap accounting implications : as the regulatory model in the u.k. is incentive based rather than a cost recovery model, wpd is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by gaap. therefore, the accounting treatment for the accelerated recovery of depreciation, pension deficit funding, cost of debt recovery, income tax recovery and the adjustments to base revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated primarily based on revenue recognition guidance. see "revenue recognition" in note 1 to the financial statements for additional information. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our u.k. regulated segment" for additional information on the risks associated with the u.k. regulated segment. kentucky regulated segment (ppl) consists of the operations of lke, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of lg&amp;e and ku. in addition, certain acquisition-related financing costs are allocated to the kentucky regulated segment. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lg&amp;e and ku, direct subsidiaries of lke, are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky and, in ku's case, virginia and tennessee. lg&amp;e also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. lg&amp;e provides electric service to approximately 411,000 customers in louisville and adjacent areas in kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 326,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in kentucky. ku provides electric service to approximately 525,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western kentucky, approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern virginia, and three customers in tennessee, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. ku also sells wholesale electricity to 10 municipalities in kentucky under load following contracts. 11 table of contents details of operating revenues, in millions, by customer class for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2017 2016 2015 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue lke commercial $ 854 27 $ 834 27 $ 816 26 industrial 603 19 601 19 628 20 residential 1,259 40 1,261 40 1,245 40 other (a) 280 9 288 9 267 9 wholesale - municipal 112 4 116 4 114 4 wholesale - other (b) 48 1 41 1 45 1 total $ 3,156 100 $ 3,141 100 $ 3,115 100 (a) primarily includes revenues from street lighting and other public authorities.

(b) this generation represents a 3.7% decrease for lke, a 0.3% increase for lg&amp;e and a 6.3% decrease for ku from 2016 output. the majority of lg&amp;e's and ku's generated electricity was used to supply their retail and ku's municipal customer base. lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail and municipal customers. when lg&amp;e has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of ku, ku purchases electricity from lg&amp;e and vice versa. as a result of environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, ku anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the e.w. brown plant in 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 mw. in 2016, lg&amp;e and ku completed construction activities and placed into commercial operation a 10 mw solar generating facility at the e.w. brown generating site. additionally, lg&amp;e and ku received approval from the kpsc to develop a 4 mw solar share facility to service a solar share program. the solar share program is an optional, voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the solar share facility. construction is expected to begin, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete. as of december 31, 2017, lg&amp;e and ku have not yet constructed the first solar share facility and are actively marketing the program and continue to receive interest from customers. in 2015, ku retired two coal-fired units, with a combined capacity of 161 mw, at the green river plant. additionally, lg&amp;e retired three coal-fired units with a combined capacity of 563 mw, at the cane run plant. fuel supply coal and natural gas will continue to be the predominant fuel used by lg&amp;e and ku for generation for the foreseeable future. natural gas used for generation is primarily purchased using contractual arrangements separate from lg&amp;e's natural gas distribution operations. natural gas and oil will continue to be used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. 13 table of contents fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. lg&amp;e and ku have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2023 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. for their existing units, lg&amp;e and ku expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western kentucky, southern indiana and southern illinois. lg&amp;e and ku continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from wyoming for blending at trimble county unit 2. coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail. to enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, lg&amp;e and ku have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity with contracts of various durations from 2019 to 2024 on the interstate pipeline serving cane run unit 7. this pipeline also serves the six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the trimble county site as well as four other simple cycle units at the cane run and paddy's run sites. lg&amp;e has also secured long-term firm pipeline transport capacity on an interstate pipeline for the summer months through october 2018 to serve an additional simple cycle gas turbine operated under a tolling agreement that ends april 30, 2019. for the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the e.w. brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility being interconnected to two pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability. lg&amp;e and ku have firm contracts for a portion of the natural gas fuel for cane run unit 7 for delivery in future months. the bulk of the natural gas fuel remains purchased on the spot market. (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) natural gas distribution supply five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 billion cubic feet (bcf), are used in providing natural gas service to lg&amp;e's firm sales customers. by using natural gas storage facilities, lg&amp;e avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads. natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. without this storage capacity, lg&amp;e would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services can be expected to be at their highest. at december 31, 2017 , lg&amp;e had 12 bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $43 million . lg&amp;e has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. these natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. in tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. lg&amp;e purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. lg&amp;e has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by lg&amp;e between 2020 and 2023. total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 mmbtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 mmbtu/day. with this same pipeline, lg&amp;e also has another contract for pipeline capacity through 2026 in the amount of 60,000 mmbtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. lg&amp;e has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 mmbtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2023. lg&amp;e expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in south texas, east texas, north louisiana and arkansas, as well as gas originating in the marcellus and utica production areas. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) transmission lg&amp;e and ku contract with the tennessee valley authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with transerv international, inc. to act as their independent transmission organization. 14 table of contents rates lg&amp;e is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc and the ferc, and ku is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc, the ferc and the vscc. lg&amp;e and ku operate under a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff. lg&amp;e's and ku's kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. as such, lg&amp;e and ku generally earn a return on regulatory assets in kentucky. ku's virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). as all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets. ku's rates to 10 municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). as all regulatory assets and liabilities, except regulatory assets recorded for aros related to ccr impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets. in april 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality that terminated service in 2017. rate case proceedings (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) in november 2016, lg&amp;e and ku filed requests with the kpsc for increases in annual base electricity and gas rates. lg&amp;e's and ku's applications included requests for cpcns for implementing an advanced metering system program and a distribution automation program. in april and may 2017, lg&amp;e and ku, along with all intervening parties to the proceeding, filed with the kpsc, stipulation and recommendation agreements (stipulations) resolving all issues with the parties. among other things, the proposed stipulations provided for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with lg&amp;e base electricity rates of $59 million , lg&amp;e base gas rates of $8 million and ku base electricity rates of $55 million , reflecting a return on equity of 9.75% , the withdrawal of lg&amp;e's and ku's request for a cpcn for the advanced metering system and other changes to the revenue requirements, which dealt primarily with the timing of cost recovery, including depreciation rates. in june 2017, the kpsc issued orders approving, with certain modifications, the proposed stipulations filed in april and may 2017. the orders modified the stipulations to provide for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with lg&amp;e base electricity rates of $57 million , lg&amp;e base gas rates of $7 million , ku base electricity rates of $52 million and incorporated an authorized return on equity of 9.7% . consistent with the stipulations, the orders approved lg&amp;e's and ku's request for implementing a distribution automation program and their withdrawal of a request for a cpcn for the advanced metering system program. the orders also approved new depreciation rates for lg&amp;e and ku that resulted in higher depreciation of approximately $15 million ( $4 million for lg&amp;e and $11 million for ku) in 2017, exclusive of net additions to pp&amp;e. the orders resulted in base electricity and gas rate increases of 5.2% and 2.1% at lg&amp;e and a base electricity rate increase of 3.2% at ku. the new base rates and all elements of the orders became effective july 1, 2017. on june 23, 2017, the kpsc issued orders establishing an authorized return on equity of 9.7% for all of lg&amp;e's and ku's existing approved ecr plans and projects, replacing the prior authorized return on equity levels of 9.8% for ccr projects and 10% for all other ecr approved projects, effective with bills issued in august 2017. the annual impact of the new authorized return for ecr projects is not expected to be significant. (lke and ku) on september 29, 2017, ku filed a request seeking approval from the vscc to increase annual virginia base electricity revenue by $7 million, representing an increase of 10.4%. ku's request is based on an authorized 10.42% return on equity. subject to regulatory review and approval, new rates would become effective july 1, 2018. 15 table of contents (ppl, lke and ku) in october 2016, ku filed a request with the ferc to modify its formula rates to provide for the recovery of ccr impoundment closure costs from its departing municipal customers. in december 2016, the ferc accepted the revised rate schedules providing recovery of the costs effective december 31, 2016, subject to refund, and established limited hearing and settlement judge procedures relating to determining the applicable amortization period. in march 2017, the parties reached a settlement in principle regarding a suitable amortization period. in june 2017, a ferc judge issued an order implementing the settlement's rates on an interim basis, effective july 1, 2017. in august 2017, the ferc issued a final order approving the settlement. tcja impact on lg&amp;e and ku rates (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) on december 21, 2017, kentucky industrial utility customers, inc. submitted a complaint with the kpsc against lg&amp;e and ku, as well as other utility companies in kentucky, alleging that their respective rates would no longer be fair, just and reasonable following the enactment of the tcja reducing the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. the complaint requested the kpsc to issue an order requiring lg&amp;e and ku to begin deferring, as of january 1, 2018, the revenue requirement effect of all income tax expense savings resulting from the federal corporate income tax reduction, including the amortization of excess deferred income taxes by recording those savings in a regulatory liability account and establishing a process by which the federal corporate income tax savings will be passed back to customers. on december 27, 2017, as a result of the complaint, the kpsc ordered lg&amp;e and ku to satisfy or address the complaint and commence recording regulatory liabilities to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21% and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes on an interim basis until utility rates are adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings. on january 8, 2018, lg&amp;e and ku responded to the complaint, denying certain claims in the complaint but concurring that the tcja will result in savings for their customers. lg&amp;e and ku have stated in their responses that the companies have recorded regulatory liabilities as of december 31, 2017 to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes and will make changes to their ecr, dsm and lg&amp;e's glt rate mechanisms to begin providing the applicable savings to customers. lg&amp;e and ku also offered to establish a new bill credit mechanism effective with the april 2018 billing cycle to begin distributing the tax savings associated with base rates to customers. on january 29, 2018, lg&amp;e and ku reached a settlement agreement to commence returning savings related to the tcja to their customers. the savings will be distributed through their ecr, dsm and lg&amp;e's glt rate mechanisms beginning in march 2018 and through a new bill credit mechanism from april 1, 2018 through april 30, 2019 . the estimated impact of the rate reduction represents approximately $91 million in ku electricity revenues, $69 million in lg&amp;e electricity revenues and $17 million in lg&amp;e gas revenues for the period january 2018 through april 2019. ongoing tax savings are expected to also be addressed in lg&amp;e's and ku's next kentucky base rate case. lg&amp;e and ku have indicated their intent to file an application for base rate changes during 2018 to be effective during spring 2019. the settlement agreement is subject to review and approval by the kpsc. an order in the proceeding may occur during the first quarter of 2018. additionally, on january 8, 2018, the vscc ordered ku, as well as other utilities in virginia, to accrue regulatory liabilities reflecting the virginia jurisdictional revenue requirement impacts of the reduced federal corporate tax rate. the ferc has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the tcja. lg&amp;e and ku cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms. 16 table of contents pennsylvania regulated segment (ppl) consists of ppl electric, a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity. (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central pennsylvania. ppl electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers in this area as a plr under the customer choice act. details of revenues, in millions, by customer class for the years ended december 31 are shown

attachment revenues and street lighting, offset by contra revenue associated with the network integration transmission service expense. franchise, licenses and other regulations ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies, which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. competition pursuant to authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. pursuant to the customer choice act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in pennsylvania, and ppl electric does not own or operate any generation facilities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. rates and regulation transmission ppl electric's transmission facilities are within pjm, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. pjm serves as a ferc-approved regional transmission operator (rto) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. in addition to operating the electricity transmission network, pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary objective of any rto is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the rto directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. certain types of transmission investment are subject to competitive processes outlined in the pjm tariff. 17 table of contents as a transmission owner, ppl electric's transmission revenues are recovered through pjm and billed in accordance with a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. under this formula, rates are put into effect in june of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in ppl electric's annual ferc form 1, filed under the ferc's uniform system of accounts. any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. any change in the prior year ppl zonal peak load billing factor applied on january 1st of each year, will result in an increase or decrease in revenue until the next annual rate update goes into effect on june 1st of that same year. as a plr, ppl electric also purchases transmission services from pjm. see "plr" below. see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on rate mechanisms. distribution ppl electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the puc. currently, ppl electric's smart meter rider and the dsic are the only riders authorized to earn a return. certain operating expenses are also included in ppl electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes. pennsylvania's alternative energy portfolio standard (aeps) requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania. under the default service procurement plans approved by the puc, ppl electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the aeps. act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new plr generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing aeps. act 11 authorizes the puc to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a dsic. such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to ppl electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. ppl electric has utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in its 2015 base rate proceeding. ppl has had the ability to utilize the dsic recovery mechanism since july 2013. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129 and other legislative and regulatory impacts. plr the customer choice act requires electric distribution companies (edcs), including ppl electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the puc to act as a plr of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the plr pursuant to puc regulations. in 2017, the following average percentages of ppl electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 46% of residential, 85% of small commercial and industrial and 98% of large commercial and industrial customers. the puc continues to favor expanding the competitive market for electricity. see "regulatory matters - pennsylvania activities - act 129" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. ppl electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period june 2015 through may 2017, which included 4 solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in april and october. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period june 2017 through may 2021, which includes a total of 8 solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in april and october. pursuant to both the current and future plans, ppl electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential customers and commercial and industrial customers who elect to take that service from ppl electric. these solicitations include a mix of 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential and small commercial and industrial customers, and 12- 18 table of contents month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and industrial customers to fulfill ppl electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a plr. numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in ppl electric's service territory. since the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for ppl electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers. tcja impact on ppl electric rates the puc issued a secretarial letter on february 12, 2018 regarding the tcja. the commission is requesting comments from interested parties addressing whether the commission should adjust current customer rates to reflect the reduced federal income tax expense and, if so, the appropriate negative surcharge or other methodology that would permit immediate adjustment to consumer rates, and whether the surcharge or other said methodology should provide that any refunds to customers due to reduced taxes be effective as of january 1, 2018. in addition, the secretarial letter requests certain pennsylvania regulated utilities, including ppl electric, to provide certain data related to the effect of the tcja on ppl electric's income tax expense and rate base including whether any of the potential tax savings from the reduced federal corporate tax rate can be used for purposes other than to reduce customer rates. ppl electric's responses are due to the puc not later than march 9, 2018. the ferc has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the tcja. (ppl) corporate and other ppl services provides ppl subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. the costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees or a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs. ppl capital funding, ppl's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of ppl and certain subsidiaries. ppl's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through ppl capital funding, that enables ppl to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of ppl's rated companies. as a result, ppl plans to utilize ppl capital funding as a source of capital in future financings, in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies. unlike ppl services, ppl capital funding's costs are not generally charged to ppl subsidiaries. costs are charged directly to ppl. however, ppl capital funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of lke and wpd midlands and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the kentucky regulated and u.k. regulated segments. the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other ppl capital funding securities, have been assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of ppl management's assessment of segment performance. the financing costs associated primarily with ppl capital funding's securities issuances beginning in 2013, with certain exceptions, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment. spinoff of ppl energy supply in june 2014, ppl and ppl energy supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of riverstone to spin off ppl energy supply and immediately combine it with riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named talen energy. on april 29, 2015, ppl's board of directors declared the june 1, 2015 distribution to ppl's shareowners of record on may 20, 2015 of a newly formed entity, holdco, which at closing owned all of the membership interests of ppl energy supply and all of the common stock of talen energy. immediately following the spinoff on june 1, 2015, holdco merged with a special purpose subsidiary of talen energy, with holdco continuing as the surviving company to the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of talen energy and the sole owner of ppl energy supply. substantially contemporaneous with the spinoff and merger, rjs power was contributed by its owners to become a subsidiary of talen energy. ppl's shareowners received approximately 0.1249 shares of talen energy common stock for each share of ppl common stock they owned on may 20, 2015. following completion of these transactions, ppl shareowners owned 65% of talen energy and affiliates of riverstone owned 35%. the spinoff had no effect on the 19 table of contents number of ppl common shares owned by ppl shareowners or the number of shares of ppl common stock outstanding. the transaction is intended to be tax-free to ppl and its shareowners for u.s. federal income tax purposes. ppl has no continuing ownership interest in or control of talen energy and talen energy supply (formerly ppl energy supply). see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.

years and the sources, motivations and techniques of attack continue to evolve and change rapidly. ppl has undertaken a variety of actions to monitor and address cyber-related risks. cybersecurity and the effectiveness of ppl's cybersecurity strategy are regular topics of discussion at board and audit committee meetings. ppl's strategy for managing cyber-related risks is risk-based and, where appropriate, integrated within the company's enterprise risk management processes. ppl's chief information security officer (ciso), who reports directly to the chief executive officer, leads a dedicated cybersecurity team and is responsible for the design, implementation, and execution of cyber-risk management strategy. among other things, the ciso and the cybersecurity team actively monitor the registrants' systems, regularly review policies, compliance, regulations and best practices, perform penetration testing, lead response exercises and internal campaigns, and provide training and communication across the organization to strengthen secure behavior. the cybersecurity team also routinely participates in industry-wide programs to further information sharing, intelligence gathering, and unity of effort in responding to potential or actual attacks. in addition to these enterprise-wide initiatives, ppl's kentucky and pennsylvania operations are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cybersecurity requirements that are developed and enforced by nerc and approved by ferc to protect grid security and reliability. finally, ppl purchases insurance to protect against a wide range of costs that could be incurred in connection with cyber-related incidents. there can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be effective to prevent interruption of services or other damage to the registrants' businesses or operations or that ppl's insurance coverage will cover all costs incurred in connection with any cyber-related incident. available information ppl's internet website is www.pplweb.com. under the investors heading of that website, ppl provides access to all sec filings of the registrants (including annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(d) or 15(d)) free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec. additionally, the registrants' filings are available at the sec's website (www.sec.gov) and at the sec's public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, dc 20549, or by calling 1-800-sec-0330. 21 table of contents item 1a. risk factors the registrants face various risks associated with their businesses. our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. in addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 13 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. as used in this item 1a., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or ppl electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania regulated segment discussion, or lke and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the kentucky regulated segment discussion. (ppl) risks related to our u.k. segment our u.k. distribution business contributes a significant amount of ppl's earnings and exposes us to the following additional risks related to operating outside the u.s., including risks associated with changes in u.k. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions and political conditions and policies of the u.k. government and the european union. these risks may adversely impact the results of operations of our u.k. distribution business or affect our ability to access u.k. revenues for payment of distributions or for other corporate purposes in the u.s. changes in laws or regulations relating to u.k. operations, including rate regulations, operational performance and tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; regulatory reviews of tariffs for dnos, including the potential riio-edi mid-period review currently being evaluated by ofgem, with a decision as to whether to engage in such a review and the scope thereof to be announced in the spring of 2018; changes in labor relations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; changes in u.s. tax law applicable to taxation of foreign earnings; compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws; and prolonged periods of low inflation or deflation. ppl's earnings may be adversely affected as a result of the march 2017 formal notification by the u.k. of its intent to withdraw from the european union. significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the effects of the march 2017 formal notification by the u.k. of its intent to withdraw from the european union, including the duration and outcome of negotiations between the u.k. and european union as to the terms of the withdrawal. ppl cannot predict the impact, in either the short-term or long-term, on foreign exchange rates or ppl's long-term financial condition that may be experienced as a result of the actions taken by the u.k. government to withdraw from the european union, although such impacts could be significant. we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks because a significant portion of our cash flows and reported earnings are currently generated by our u.k. business operations. these risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value of the british pound sterling and the u.s. dollar between the time we initially invest u.s. dollars in our u.k. businesses, and our strategy to hedge against such changes, and the time that cash is repatriated to the u.s. from the u.k., including cash flows from our u.k. businesses that may be distributed to ppl or used for repayments of intercompany loans or other general corporate purposes. in addition, ppl's consolidated reported earnings on a gaap basis may be subject to earnings translation risk, which is the result of the conversion of earnings as reported in our u.k. businesses on a british pound sterling basis to a u.s. dollar basis in accordance with gaap requirements. 22 table of contents our u.k. segment is subject to inflationary risks. our u.k. distribution business is subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in rpi in the u.k., which is a measure of inflation. in riio-ed1, wpd's base demand revenue was established by ofgem based on 2012/13 prices. base demand revenue is subsequently adjusted to reflect any increase or decrease in rpi for each year to determine the amount of revenue wpd can collect in tariffs. the rpi is forecasted annually by hm treasury and subject to true-up in subsequent years. consequently, the fluctuations between forecasted and actual rpi can result in variances in base demand revenue. although wpd also has debt that is indexed to rpi and certain components of operations and maintenance expense are affected by inflation, these may not offset changes in base demand revenue and timing of such offsets would likely not be correlated precisely with the calendar year in which the variance in demand revenue was initially incurred. further, as rav is indexed to rpi under u.k. rate regulations, a reduction in rpi could adversely affect a borrower's debt-to-rav ratio, potentially limiting future borrowings at wpd's holding company. our u.k. delivery business is subject to revenue variability based on operational performance. our u.k. delivery businesses operate under an incentive-based regulatory framework. managing operational risk and delivering agreed-upon performance are critical to the u.k. regulated segment's financial performance. disruption to these distribution networks could reduce profitability both directly by incurring costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that ofgem administers relating to customer service levels. a failure by any of our u.k. regulated businesses to comply with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by ofgem that could have an adverse impact on ppl. ofgem has powers to levy fines of up to ten percent of revenue for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may be revoked. ofgem also has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license and there can be no assurance that a restrictive modification will not be introduced in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the u.k. regulated businesses and ppl. risks related to all segments ( all registrants ) the operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risks. numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. the operation of our transmission and distribution operations, as well as our generation plants, are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that such systems could be the target of disruptive actions, principally by terrorists or criminals, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. as a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to our reputation. in addition, under the energy policy act of 2005, users, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system, including ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by nerc and serc and enforced by ferc. as the operator of natural gas distribution systems, lg&amp;e is also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the u.s. department of transportation. failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. we are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations. changes in tax law, including the recent enactment of the tcja, as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations. we are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, property, gross receipts, franchise, sales and use, employment-related and other taxes. we also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits. due to the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered. we cannot predict changes in tax law or regulation or the effect of any such changes on our businesses. any such changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. 23 table of contents the tcja had a significant impact on our 2017 financial statements and expected future operating cash flows. we have completed or made reasonable estimates of the effects of the tcja reflected in our december 31, 2017 financial statements, but we continue to evaluate the application of various components of the law in the calculation of income tax expense. increases in electricity prices and/or a weak economy, can lead to changes in legislative and regulatory policy, including the promotion of energy efficiency, conservation and distributed generation or self-generation, which may adversely impact our business. energy consumption is significantly impacted by overall levels of economic activity and costs of energy supplies. economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs can lead to changes in or the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency, alternative and renewable energy sources, and distributed or self-generation by customers. this focus on conservation, energy efficiency and self-generation may result in a decline in electricity demand, which could adversely affect our business. we could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our credit ratings, adverse credit market conditions or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets. in the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt service and operating needs. as a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rates, credit rating considerations, insurance, security or collateral requirements, market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased availability of credit. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. credit ratings assigned by moody's and s&amp;p to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. a ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund liquidity needs and access new long-term debt at acceptable interest rates. see "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - ratings triggers" for additional information on the financial impact of a downgrade in our credit ratings. our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of extreme weather conditions. our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions diverge adversely from seasonal norms. operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters. weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs. storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues and increase expenses, due to reduced usage and restoration costs. our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change. climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electricity. in addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs to prepare for or respond to these effects. these or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electricity, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies. reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered by consumers' preferences or market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage. 24 table of contents we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to our current and past business activities. an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and subject to ongoing state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in "federal matters" in note 6 to the financial statements and "legal matters," "regulatory issues" and "environmental matters" in note 13 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting and reducing our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, inflation rates, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. we may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations. in connection with various divestitures, and certain other transactions, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities. these indemnities and guarantees relate, among other things, to liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated a divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture. see "guarantees and other assurances" in note 13 to the financial statements. we are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution operations. the conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties. our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses and decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial performance. operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. these events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently and lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance costs, which may not be recoverable from customers. planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us in the event losses occur. 25 table of contents we are required to obtain, and to comply with, government permits and approvals. we are required to obtain, and to comply with, numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from governmental agencies. the process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex and can sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which the permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. in addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals, or failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, may result in the delay or temporary suspension of our operations and electricity sales or the curtailment of our power delivery and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions. although various regulators routinely renew existing licenses, renewal could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including failure to provide adequate financial assurance for closure; failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permit conditions; local community, political or other opposition; and executive, legislative or regulatory action. our cost or inability to obtain and comply with the permits and approvals required for our operations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows. in addition, new environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed interpretations of existing laws may elicit claims that historical routine modification activities at our facilities violated applicable laws and regulations. in addition to the possible imposition of fines in such cases, we may be required to undertake significant capital investments in pollution control technology and obtain additional operating permits or approvals, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. war, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business. war, terrorist attacks and unrest have caused and may continue to cause instability in the world's financial and commercial markets and have contributed to high levels of volatility in prices for oil and gas. in addition, unrest in the middle east could lead to acts of terrorism in the united states, the united kingdom or elsewhere, and acts of terrorism could be directed against companies such as ours. armed conflicts and terrorism and their effects on us or our markets may significantly affect our business and results of operations in the future. in addition, we may incur increased costs for security, including additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident. we are subject to counterparty performance, credit or other risk in their provision of goods or services to us, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities or conduct business activities. we purchase from a variety of suppliers energy, capacity, fuel, natural gas, transmission service and certain commodities used in the physical operation of our businesses, as well as goods or services, including information technology rights and services, used in the administration of our businesses. delivery of these goods and services is dependent on the continuing operational performance and financial viability of our contractual counterparties and also the markets, infrastructure or third-parties they use to provide such goods and services to us. as a result, we are subject to the risks of disruptions, curtailments or increased costs in the operation of our businesses if such goods or services are unavailable or become subject to price spikes or if a counterparty fails to perform. such disruptions could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities or deliver our services and collect our revenues, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. the performance of coal markets and producers may be the subject of increased counterparty risk to lke, lg&amp;e and ku currently due to weaknesses in such markets and suppliers. the coal industry is subject to increasing competitive pressures from natural gas markets and new or more stringent environmental regulation, including greenhouse gases or other air emissions, combustion byproducts and water inputs or discharges. consequently, the coal industry faces increased production costs or closed customer markets. we are subject to the risk that our workforce and its knowledge base may become depleted in coming years. we are experiencing an increase in attrition due primarily to the number of retiring employees, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed personnel, and to attract and retain new personnel, with appropriate skills and experience, due to a declining trend in the number of available skilled workers and an increase in competition for such workers. 26 table of contents (ppl and lke) risk related to registrant holding companies ppl and lke are holding companies and their cash flows and ability to meet their obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and ppl's ability to pay dividends, largely depends on the financial performance of their respective subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries. ppl and lke are holding companies and conduct their operations primarily through subsidiaries. substantially all of the consolidated assets of these registrants are held by their subsidiaries. accordingly, these registrants' cash flows and ability to meet debt and guaranty obligations, as well as ppl's ability to pay dividends, are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends, distributions, loans, advances or repayment of loans and advances. the subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends or distributions to their parents or to make funds available for such a payment. the ability of the registrants' subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions in the future will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory requirements, including restrictions on the ability of ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku to pay dividends under section 305(a) of the federal power act. because ppl and lke are holding companies, their debt and guaranty obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of their subsidiaries. although certain agreements to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, ppl and lke and their subsidiaries retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities. therefore, ppl's and lke's rights and the rights of their creditors, including rights of debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of their subsidiaries, in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors. in addition, if ppl elects to receive distributions of earnings from its foreign operations, ppl may incur u.s. income taxes, net of any available foreign tax credits, on such amounts. (ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku) risks related to domestic regulated utility operations our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to each of the kentucky regulated segment and the pennsylvania regulated segment. set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments. our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments. regulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged. the rates we charge our utility customers must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the ferc, kpsc, vscc and puc. although rate regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full or timely recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments. federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our current or future rate requests, structures or mechanisms, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we receive. although our rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year or on future projected costs, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. our domestic regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will likely require rate increase requests to the regulators. if our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation. in addition to regulating the rates we charge, various federal and state regulatory authorities regulate many aspects of our domestic utility operations, including: the terms and conditions of our service and operations; 27 table of contents financial and capital structure matters; siting, construction and operation of facilities; mandatory reliability and safety standards under the energy policy act of 2005 and other standards of conduct; accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies; tax matters; affiliate transactions; acquisition and disposal of utility assets and issuance of securities; and various other matters, including energy efficiency. such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties which may not be recoverable from customers. our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs. the domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of lg&amp;e and ku) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. the completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including: approval, licensing and permitting; land acquisition and the availability of suitable land; skilled labor or equipment shortages; construction problems or delays, including disputes with third-party intervenors; increases in commodity prices or labor rates; and contractor performance. failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators. we are or may be subject to costs of remediation of environmental contamination at facilities owned or operated by our former subsidiaries. we may be subject to liability for the costs of environmental remediation of property now or formerly owned by us with respect to substances that we may have generated regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during or after the time we owned or operated the facilities. we also have current or previous ownership interests in sites associated with the production of manufactured gas for which we may be liable for additional costs related to investigation, remediation and monitoring of these sites. remediation activities associated with our former manufactured gas plant operations are one source of such costs. citizen groups or others may bring litigation regarding environmental issues including claims of various types, such as property damage, personal injury and citizen challenges to compliance decisions on the enforcement of environmental requirements, which could subject us to penalties, injunctive relief and the cost of litigation. we cannot predict the amount and timing of all future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties) related to such environmental matters, although they could be material. risks specific to kentucky regulated segment ( ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku ) the costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are significant and are subject to continuing changes. extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to lg&amp;e's and ku's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid wastes, among other business-related activities, and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted but could be material. in addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures, operational changes, permit limitations or other restrictions. at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. market prices for energy and capacity also affect this cost-effectiveness analysis. many of these environmental law considerations are 28 table of contents also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products and demand for our services. ongoing changes in environmental regulations or their implementation requirements and our related compliance strategies entail a number of uncertainties. the environmental standards governing lg&amp;e's and ku's businesses, particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to rulemaking and other regulatory developments, legislative activities and litigation, administrative or permit challenges. revisions to applicable standards, changes in compliance deadlines and invalidation of rules on appeal may require major changes in compliance strategies, operations or assets and adjustments to prior plans. depending on the extent, frequency and timing of such changes, the companies may be subject to inconsistent requirements under multiple regulatory programs, compressed windows for decision-making and short compliance deadlines that may require new technologies or aggressive schedules for construction, permitting and other regulatory approvals. under such circumstances, the companies may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, delayed or incomplete rate recovery or increased costs of implementation. we are subject to operational, regulatory and other risks regarding certain significant developments in environmental regulation affecting coal-fired generation facilities. certain regulatory initiatives have been implemented or are under development which could represent significant developments or changes in environmental regulation and compliance costs or risk associated with the combustion of coal as occurs at lg&amp;e's and ku's coal-fired generation facilities. in particular, such developments include the federal coal combustion residuals regulations governing coal by-product storage activities and the federal effluent limitations guidelines governing water discharge activities. such initiatives have the potential to require significant changes in generation portfolio composition and in coal combustion byproduct handling and disposal or water treatment and release facilities and methods from those historically used or currently available. consequently, such developments may involve increased risks relating to the uncertain cost, efficacy and reliability of new technologies, equipment or methods. compliance with such regulations could result in significant changes to lg&amp;e's and ku's operations or commercial practices and material additional capital or operating expenditures. such circumstances could also involve higher risks of compliance violations or of variations in rate or regulatory treatment when compared to existing frameworks. risks specific to pennsylvania regulated segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) we plan to selectively pursue growth of our transmission capacity, which involves a number of uncertainties and may not achieve the desired financial results. we plan to pursue expansion of our transmission capacity over the next several years. we plan to do this through the potential construction or acquisition of transmission projects and capital investments to upgrade transmission infrastructure. these types of projects involve numerous risks. with respect to the construction or acquisition of transmission projects, we may be required to expend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before it can be established whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. expansion in our regulated businesses is dependent on future load or service requirements and subject to applicable regulatory processes. the success of both a new or acquired project would likely be contingent, among other things, upon the negotiation of satisfactory construction contracts, obtaining acceptable financing and maintaining acceptable credit ratings, as well as receipt of required and appropriate governmental approvals. if we were unable to complete construction or expansion of a project, we may not be able to recover our investment in the project. we face competition for transmission projects, which could adversely affect our rate base growth. ferc order 1000, issued in july 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electric transmission planning activities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. increased competition can result in lower rate base growth. 29 table of contents we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to pennsylvania conservation and energy efficiency programs. ppl electric is subject to act 129 which contains requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposes plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing alternative energy portfolio standard. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. utilities not meeting these act 129 requirements are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. other (ppl) risks relating to the spinoff of ppl energy supply and formation of talen energy corporation if the spinoff of ppl energy supply does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under sections 355 and 368 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of ppl or talen energy, then ppl and/or its shareowners may be required to pay substantial u.s. federal income taxes. among other requirements, the completion of the june 1, 2015 spinoff of ppl energy supply and subsequent combination with rjs power was conditioned upon ppl's receipt of a legal opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff will qualify as a reorganization pursuant to section 368(a)(1)(d) and a tax-free distribution pursuant to section 355 of the code. although receipt of such legal opinion was a condition to completion of the spinoff and subsequent combination, that legal opinion is not binding on the irs. accordingly, the irs could reach conclusions that are different from those in the tax opinion. if, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, the irs were to determine the distribution to be taxable (including as a result of the subsequent acquisition of talen energy by affiliates of riverstone on december 6, 2016 (the "talen acquisition")), ppl would, and its shareowners could, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax liability that could be substantial. in addition, notwithstanding the receipt of such opinion, if the irs were to determine the merger to be taxable (including as a result of the talen acquisition), ppl shareowners may, depending on their individual circumstances, recognize a tax liability that could be material. in addition, the spinoff would be taxable to ppl pursuant to section 355(e) of the code if there were a 50% or greater change in ownership (by vote or value) of either ppl or talen energy (including as a result of the talen acquisition), directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff. because ppl's shareowners collectively owned more than 50% of talen energy's common stock following the spinoff and combination with rjs power, the combination alone would not cause the spinoff to be taxable to ppl under section 355(e) of the code. however, section 355(e) of the code might apply if acquisitions of stock of ppl before or after the spinoff, or of talen energy after the combination (including the talen acquisition), were considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff. ppl is not aware of any such plan or series of transactions that include the spinoff. in connection with the closing of the talen acquisition, talen energy was required to deliver to ppl a legal opinion of tax counsel concluding that the talen acquisition would not affect the tax-free status of the spinoff. as described above, such legal opinion is not binding on the irs, and accordingly, the irs could reach conclusions that are different from those expressed in the legal opinion. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market

over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ deloitte &amp; touche llp parsippany, new jersey february 22, 2018 95 table of

subject to regulation as a public utility by the kpsc and the vscc, and certain of its transmission and wholesale power activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the federal power act. ku serves its kentucky customers under the ku name and its virginia customers under the old dominion power name. ku was incorporated in kentucky in 1912 and in virginia in 1991. segment information (ppl) ppl is organized into three reportable segments as depicted in the chart above: u.k. regulated, kentucky regulated, and pennsylvania regulated. the u.k. regulated segment has no related subsidiary registrants. ppl's other reportable segments' results primarily represent the results of its related subsidiary registrants, except that the reportable segments are also allocated certain corporate level financing costs that are not included in the results of the applicable subsidiary registrants. ppl also has corporate and other costs which primarily include financing costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, as well as certain other unallocated costs. the financial results of safari energy are also reported within corporate and other. a comparison of ppl's three regulated segments is shown below. kentucky pennsylvania u.k. regulated regulated regulated for the year ended december 31, 2018: operating revenues

regulated. see note 2 to the financial statements for additional financial information about the segments. (ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl electric has two operating segments that are aggregated into a single reportable segment. lke, lg&amp;e and ku are individually single operating and reportable segments. u.k. regulated segment (ppl) consists of ppl global, which primarily includes wpd's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of wpd's earnings from british pound sterling into u.s. dollars, and certain costs, such as u.s. income taxes, administrative costs and acquisition-related financing costs. wpd operates four of the 14 ofgem regulated dnos providing electricity service in the u.k. through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries: wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands). the number of network customers (end-users) served by wpd totals 7.9 million across 21,600 square miles in south wales and southwest and central england. revenues, in millions, for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 4 table of contents 2018 2017 2016 operating revenues (a) $ 2,268 $ 2,091 $ 2,207 (a) wpd's operating revenues are translated from gbp to u.s. dollars using the average gbp to u.s. dollar exchange rates in effect each month. the annual weighted average of the monthly gbp to u.s. dollar exchange rates used for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $1.34 per gbp, $1.28 per gbp and $1.37 per gbp. franchise and licenses wpd's operations are regulated by ofgem under the direction of the gas and electricity markets authority. ofgem is a non-ministerial government department and an independent national regulatory authority that is responsible for protecting the interests of existing and future electricity and natural gas consumers. the electricity act 1989 provides the fundamental framework for electricity companies and established licenses that require each of the dnos to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. wpd's operations are regulated under these licenses which set the outputs wpd needs to deliver for their customers and associated revenues wpd is allowed to earn. wpd operates under a regulatory year that begins april 1 and ends march 31 of each year. ofgem has the formal power to propose modifications to each distribution license; however licensees can appeal such changes to the u.k.'s competition and markets authority in the event of a disagreement with the regulator. generally, any potential changes to these licenses are reviewed with stakeholders in a formal regulatory consultation process prior to a formal change proposal. competition although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. wpd's four dnos are, therefore, regulated monopolies, which operate under regulatory price controls. customers wpd provides regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers who use wpd's networks to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users. wpd bills energy suppliers for this service and the supplier is responsible for billing its end-users. ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the distribution connection and use of system agreement. this agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to collateralize its payment obligations. wpd's costs make up approximately 17% of a u.k. end-user customer's electricity bill. u.k. regulation and rates overview ofgem has adopted a price control regulatory framework with a balanced objective of enhancing and developing electricity networks for the future, controlling costs to customers and allowing dnos, such as wpd's dnos, to earn a fair return on their investments. this regulatory structure is focused on outputs and performance in contrast to traditional u.s. utility ratemaking that operates under a cost recovery model. price controls are established based on long-term business plans developed by each dno with substantial input from its stakeholders. to measure the outputs and performance, each dno business plan includes incentive targets that allow for increases and/or reductions in revenues based on operational performance, which are intended to align returns with quality of service, innovation and customer satisfaction. for comparative purposes, amounts listed below are in british pounds sterling, nominal prices and in calendar years unless otherwise noted. key ratemaking mechanisms ppl believes the u.k. electricity utility model is a premium jurisdiction in which to do business due to its significant stakeholder engagement, incentive-based structure and high-quality ratemaking mechanisms. 5 table of contents current price control: riio-ed1 wpd is currently operating under an eight-year price control period called riio-ed1, which commenced for electricity distribution companies on april 1, 2015. the regulatory framework is based on an updated approach for sustainable network regulation known as the "riio" model where revenue = incentives + innovation + outputs. the riio framework allowed for an mpr. on april 30, 2018, ofgem announced its decision not to conduct an mpr of the riio-ed1 price control period. in coordination with numerous stakeholders, wpd developed its business plans for riio-ed1 building off its historical track record and long-term strategy of delivering industry-leading levels of performance at an efficient level of cost. as a result, all four of wpd's dnos' business plans were accepted by ofgem as "well justified" and were "fast-tracked" ahead of all of the other dnos. wpd's dnos were rewarded for being fast-tracked with preferential financial incentives, a higher return on equity and higher cost savings retention under their business plans as discussed further below. however, an unintended consequence of being fast-tracked resulted in wpd being disadvantaged from a cost of debt recovery standpoint as further discussed within (2) real return on capital from rav below. wpd's combined riio-ed1 business plans as accepted by ofgem included funding for total expenditures of approximately 12.8 billion (nominal) over the eight-year period, broken down as follows: totex - 8.5 billion ( 6.8 billion recovered as additions to rav over time ("slow pot"); 1.7 billion recovered in the year spent in the plan ("fast pot")); pension deficit funding - 1.2 billion; cost of debt recovery - 1.0 billion; pass through charges - 1.6 billion (property taxes, ofgem fees and national grid transmissions charges); and corporate income taxes recovery - 0.5 billion. the chart below illustrates the building blocks of allowed revenue and gaap net income for the u.k. regulated segment. the revenue components are shown in either 2012/13 prices or nominal prices, consistent with the formulas ofgem established for riio-ed1. the reference numbers included in each block correspond with the descriptions that follow. (a) primarily pension deficit funding, pass through costs, profiling adjustments and legacy price control adjustments. (b) primarily pass through true-ups and 5 per residential customer reduction completed in the regulatory year ended march 31, 2017. (c) reference form 8-k filed february 14, 2019 for u.k. regulated segment gaap statement of income component values. (d) includes the service cost component of gaap pension costs/income. see defined benefits, net periodic defined benefit costs (credits) in note 11 to the financial statements. (e) primarily property taxes. (f) primarily includes the non-service cost (credit) components of gaap pension costs/income and gains and losses on foreign currency hedges. (g) includes wpd interest and $32 million of allocated interest expense to finance the acquisition of wpd midlands. (h) gaap income taxes represent an effective tax rate of 17% for 2018, 19% for 2017, 16% for 2016 and approximately 17% going forward. 6 table of contents (1) base revenue the base revenue that a dno can collect in each year of the current price control period is the sum of the following which are discussed further below: a return on capital from rav; a return of capital from rav (i.e., depreciation); the fast pot recovery, see discussion (4) expenditure efficiency mechanisms below; an allowance for cash taxes paid less a potential reduction for tax benefits from excess leverage if a dno is levered more than 65% debt/rav; pension deficit funding; certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control; profiling adjustments, see discussion (6) other revenue included in base revenue below; certain legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods, including the information quality incentive (also known as the rolling rav incentive); and fast-track incentive - because wpd's four dnos were fast-tracked through the price control review process for riio-ed1, their base revenue also includes the fast-track incentive. (2) real return on capital from rav real-time returns on cost of regulated equity (real) - ofgem establishes an allowed return on regulated equity that dnos earn in their base business plan revenues as a consideration of the financial parameters for each riio-ed1 business plan. for wpd, the base cost of equity collected in revenues was set at 6.4% (real). base equity returns exclude inflation adjustments, allowances for incentive rewards/penalties and over/under collections driven by cost efficiencies. wpd's base equity returns are calculated using an equity ratio of 35% of rav at the dno. the equity ratio was reviewed and set during the riio-ed1 business plan process taking various stakeholder impacts into consideration such as costs to consumers, credit ratings and investor needs. the amounts of base real equity return for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 160 million, 151 million and 144 million. indexed cost of debt recovery (real) - as part of wpd's fast-track agreement with ofgem for riio-ed1, wpd collects in revenues an assumed real cost of debt that is derived from a historical 10-year bond index (iboxx) and adjusted annually for inflation. this calculated real cost of debt is then applied to 65% of rav at the dnos to determine the cost of debt revenue recovery. the cost of debt was set at 2.55% in the original "well justified" business plans. the recovery amounts are trued up annually as a component of the mod true-up mechanism described within " (9) mod and inflation true-up (tru) " below. as discussed above, wpd's cost of debt revenue allowances are derived from using a rolling 10-year trailing average of historical 10-year bond index (iboxx); however, the cost of debt revenue allowances for all slow track companies are derived using an extending trailing average of the index. under this approach, the trailing average period used is progressively extended from 10 to 20 years and consequently short-term fluctuations in the interest rate have a less pronounced effect on the regulatory cost of debt applied. therefore, wpd's cost of debt recovery is significantly lower than it would have been had it been derived under the approach used for the slow-track companies. over the 8-year riio-ed1 period wpd is expected to under-recover its cost of debt at the four dnos, based upon the latest inflation assumptions and projected 10-year iboxx bond indices rates, by approximately 175 million primarily driven by the previously discussed differing cost of debt recovery calculations. under the terms of the fast track process, fast tracked companies were not supposed to be disadvantaged financially to slow track companies. it is uncertain, however, at this time, if wpd will be able to recover any of this under-recovery in the next price control period, riio-ed2, beginning april 1, 2023. interest costs relating to long-term debt issued at wpd's holding companies are not recovered in revenues and for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 46 million, 49 million and 54 million. (3) recovery of depreciation in revenues - recovery of depreciation in regulatory revenues is one of the key mechanisms ofgem uses to support financeable business plans that provide incentives to attract the continued substantial investment required in the u.k. differences between gaap and regulatory depreciation exist primarily due to differing assumptions on asset lives and because rav is adjusted for inflation using rpi. compared to asset lives established for gaap, asset lives established for ratemaking are set by ofgem based on economic lives which results in improved near-term revenues and cash flows for dnos during investment cycles. under u.k. regulation prior to riio-ed1, electric distribution assets were depreciated on a 20-year asset life for the purpose of setting revenues. after 7 table of contents review and consultation, ofgem decided to use 45-year asset lives for rav additions after april 1, 2015, with transitional arrangements available for dnos that fully demonstrated a need to ensure a financeable plan. wpd adopted a transition that has a linear increase in asset lives from 20 to 45 years for additions to rav in each year of riio-ed1 (with additions averaging a life of approximately 35 years over this period), which adds support to its credit metrics. rav additions prior to march 31, 2015 continue to be recovered in revenues over 20 years. the asset lives used to determine depreciation expense for gaap purposes are not the same as those used for the depreciation of the rav in setting revenues and, as such, vary by asset type and are based on the expected useful lives of the assets. effective january 1, 2015, after completing a review of the useful lives of its distribution network assets, wpd set the weighted average useful lives to 69 years for gaap depreciation expense. because ofgem uses a real cost of capital, the rav and recovery of depreciation are adjusted for inflation using rpi. the inflation revenues collected in this line item help recover the cost of equity and debt returns on a "nominal" basis, compared to the "real" rates used to set the return component of base revenues. this regulatory construct, in combination with the different assets lives used for ratemaking and gaap, results in amounts collected by wpd as recovery of depreciation in revenues being significantly higher than the amounts wpd recorded for depreciation expense under gaap. for 2018, 2017 and 2016, this difference was 444 million, 424 million and 415 million (pre-tax) and positively impacted net income. the difference is expected to continue in the 400 million to 450 million (pre-tax) range at least through 2022 (the last full calendar year of riio-ed1), assuming rpi of approximately 3.0% per year from 2019 through 2022 and based on expected rav additions of approximately 800 million per year to prepare the distribution system for future u.k. energy objectives while maintaining premier levels of reliability and customer service. (4) expenditure efficiency mechanisms - ofgem introduced the concept of totex in riio to ensure all dnos face equal incentives in choosing between operating and capital solutions. totex is split between immediate recovery (called "fast pot") and deferred recovery as an addition to the rav (called "slow pot"). the ratio of slow pot to fast pot was determined by each dno in their business plan development. wpd established a totex split of 80% slow pot and 20% fast pot for riio-ed1 to balance maximizing rav growth with immediate cost recovery to support investment grade credit ratings. comparatively, other dnos on average used a ratio of approximately 70% slow pot and 30% fast pot for riio-ed1. ofgem also allows a totex incentive mechanism that is intended to reward dnos for cost efficiency. wpd's dnos are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against its riio-ed1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends. any amounts to be returned to customers are trued up in the aip discussed below. because fast pot cost recovery represents 20% of totex expenditures and certain other costs are recovered in other components of revenue, fast pot will not equal operation and maintenance expenses recorded for gaap purposes. (5) income tax allowance - for price control purposes, wpd collects income tax based on ofgem's notional tax charge, which will not equal the amount of income tax expense recorded for gaap purposes. the following table shows the amount of taxes collected in revenues and recorded under gaap. 2018 2017 2016 taxes collected in revenues 58 57 53 taxes recorded under gaap 156 139 119 (6) other revenue included in base revenue - other revenue included in base revenue primarily consists of pension deficit funding, pass through costs, profiling adjustments and legacy price control adjustments. recovery of annual (normal) pension cost and pension deficit funding - ofgem allows dnos to recover annual (normal) pension costs through the totex allocation, split between the previously described fast pot (immediate recovery) and slow pot recovery (as an addition to rav). the amount of normal pension cost is computed by the pension trustees, using assumptions that differ from those used in calculating pension costs/income under gaap. in addition, the timing of the revenue collection may not match the actual pension payment schedule, resulting in a timing difference of cash flows. in addition, wpd recovers approximately 80% of pension deficit funding for certain of wpd's defined benefit pension plans in conjunction with actual costs similar to the fast pot mechanism. the pension deficit is determined by the pension trustees on a triennial basis in accordance with their funding requirements. pension deficit funding recovered in revenues was 147 million, 142 million and 139 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. wpd expects similar amounts to be collected in revenues through 8 table of contents march 31, 2021, but cannot predict amounts that will be collected in revenues beyond then as the plans are approaching a fully funded status. the next triennial pension review will commence in march 2019 and is expected to conclude by the end of 2020. see note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on pension costs/income recognized under gaap. recovery of pass through costs - wpd recovers certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control such as property taxes, national grid transmission charges and ofgem fees. although these items are intended to be pass-through charges there could be timing differences, primarily related to property taxes, as to when amounts are collected in revenues and when amounts are expensed in the statements of income. wpd over-collected property taxes by 38 million, 19 million and 8 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. wpd expects to continue to over-recover property taxes until the end of riio-ed1. amounts under-or over-recovered in revenues in a regulatory year are trued up through revenues two regulatory years later. profiling adjustments - ofgem permitted dnos the flexibility to make profiling adjustments to their base revenues within their business plans. these adjustments do not affect the total base revenue in real terms over the eight-year price control period, but change the year in which the revenue is collected. in the first year of riio-ed1, wpd's base revenue decreased by 11.8% compared to the final year of the prior price control period (dpcr5), primarily due to a change in profiling methodology and a lower weighted-average cost of capital. base revenue then increases by approximately 2.5% per annum before inflation for regulatory years up to march 31, 2019 and by approximately 1% per annum before inflation for each regulatory year thereafter for the remainder of riio-ed1. (7) incentives for developing high-quality business plans (known as fast-tracking) - for riio-ed1, ofgem incentivized dnos with certain financial rewards to develop "well justified" business plans that drive value to customers. wpd was awarded the following incentives for being fast-tracked by ofgem: an annual fast-track revenue incentive worth 2.5% of totex (approximately 25 million annually for wpd); a real cost of equity rate of 6.4% compared to 6.0% for slow-tracked dnos; and, cost savings retention was established at 70% for wpd compared to approximately 55% for slow-tracked dnos. (8) allowed revenue - allowed revenue is the amount that a dno can collect from its customers in order to fund its investment requirements. base revenues are adjusted annually during riio-ed1 to arrive at allowed revenues. these adjustments are discussed in sections (9) through (13) below. (9) mod and inflation true-up (tru) mod - riio-ed1 includes an aip that allows future base revenues, agreed with the regulator as part of the price control review, to be updated during the price control period for financial adjustments including taxes, pensions, cost of debt, legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods and adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the totex incentive mechanism (tim). the aip calculates an incremental change to base revenue, known as the "mod" adjustment. the mod provided by ofgem in november 2016 included the tim for the 2015/16 regulatory year, as well as the cost of debt calculation based on the 10-year trailing average to october 2016. this mod of 12 million reduced base revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by 8 million and 4 million. the mod provided by ofgem in november 2017 for the 2016/17 regulatory year is a 39 million reduction to revenue and reduced base revenue in calendar year 2018 by 26 million and will reduce base revenue in calendar year 2019 by 13 million. the mod provided by ofgem in november 2018 for the 2017/18 regulatory year is a 42 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base revenue in calendar years 2019 and 2020 by 28 million and 14 million. the projected mod for the 2018/19 regulatory year is a 87 million reduction to revenue and is expected to reduce base revenue in calendar years 2020 and 2021 by 58 million and 29 million. tru - as discussed below in " (10) inflation adjusted, multi-year rate cycle ," the base revenue for the riio-ed1 period was set based on 2012/13 prices. therefore an inflation factor as determined by forecasted rpi, provided by hm treasury, is applied to base revenue. forecasted rpi is trued up to actuals and affects future base revenue two regulatory years later. this revenue change is called the "tru" adjustment. 9 table of contents the tru for the 2015/16 regulatory year was a 31 million reduction to revenue and reduced base revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by 21 million and 10 million. the tru for the 2016/17 regulatory year was a 6 million reduction to revenue and reduced base revenue in calendar year 2018 by 4 million and will reduce base revenue in calendar year 2019 by 2 million. the tru for the 2017/18 regulatory year was a 4 million increase to revenue and will increase base revenue in calendar years 2019 and 2020 by 3 million and 1 million. the projected tru for the 2018/19 regulatory year is a 3 million increase to revenue and is expected to increase base revenue in calendar years 2020 and 2021 by 2 million and 1 million. as both mod and tru are changes to future base revenues as determined by ofgem, these adjustments are recognized as a component of revenues in future years in which service is provided and revenues are collected or returned to customers. ppl's projected earnings per share growth rate through 2020 includes both the tru and mod for regulatory years 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18 and the estimated tru and mod for 2018/19. (10) inflation adjusted, multi-year rate cycle - ofgem built its price control framework to better coincide with the long-term nature of electricity distribution investments. the current price control for electricity distribution is for the eight-year period from april 1, 2015 through march 31, 2023. this both required and enabled wpd to design a base business plan with predictable revenues and expenses over the long-term to drive value for its customers through predetermined outputs and for its investors through preset base returns. a key aspect to the multi-year cycle is an annual inflation adjustment for revenue and cost components, which are inflated using rpi from the base 2012/13 prices used to establish the business plans. consistent with ofgem's formulas, the inflation adjustment is applied to base revenue, mod and tru when determining allowed revenue. this inflation adjustment also has the effect of inflating rav, and real returns are earned on the inflated rav. (11) incentive revenues for strong operational performance and innovation - ofgem has established incentives to provide opportunities for dnos to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. these incentives can result in an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for actual performance against pre-established targets based on past performance. some of the more significant incentives that may affect allowed revenue include the interruptions incentive scheme (iis), the broad measure of customer service (bmcs) and the time to connect (ttc) incentive: the iis has two major components: (1) customer interruptions (cis) and (2) customer minutes lost (cmls), and both are designed to incentivize the dnos to invest in and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages. the bmcs encompasses customer satisfaction in supply interruptions, connections and general inquiries, complaints, stakeholder engagement and delivery of social obligations. the ttc incentive rewards dnos for reducing connection times for minor connections against an ofgem set target. the annual incentives and penalties are reflected in customer rates on a two-year lag from the time they are earned and/or assessed. based on applicable gaap, incentive revenues and penalties are recorded in revenues when they are billed to customers. the following table shows the amount of incentive revenues (in total), primarily from iis, bmcs and ttc that wpd has received and is projected to receive on a calendar year basis: incentive received calendar year ended incentive calendar year ended incentive earned (in millions) included in revenue 2014 83 2016 2015 79 2017 2016 76 2018 2017 72 2019 2018 (a) 70-80 2020 2019 (a) 70-80 2021 (a) reflects projected incentive revenues. (12) correction factor (k-factor) - during the price control period, wpd sets its tariffs to recover allowed revenue. however, in any fiscal period, wpd's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular period. conversely, wpd could over-recover revenue. over- and under-recoveries are subtracted from or added to allowed revenue in future years, known as the "correction factor" or "k-factor." over and under-recovered amounts during riio-ed1 will be refunded/recovered two regulatory years later. 10 table of contents the k-factor for the 2015/16 regulatory year was a 4 million under-recovery and increased allowed revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by 3 million and 1 million. the k-factor for the 2016/17 regulatory year was a 23 million over-recovery and reduced allowed revenue in calendar year 2018 by 15 million and will reduce allowed revenue in calendar year 2019 by 8 million. the k-factor for the 2017/18 regulatory year was a 3 million over-recovery and will reduce allowed revenue in calendar years 2019 and 2020 by 2 million and 1 million. the projected k-factor for the 2018/19 regulatory year is a 31 million over-recovery and is expected to reduce allowed revenue in calendar years 2020 and 2021 by 21 million and 10 million. historically, tariffs have been set a minimum of three months prior to the beginning of the regulatory year (april 1). in february 2015, ofgem determined that, beginning with the 2017/18 regulatory year, tariffs would be established a minimum of fifteen months in advance. therefore, in december 2015, wpd was required to establish tariffs for the 2016/17 and 2017/18 regulatory years. this change will potentially increase volatility in future revenue forecasts due to the need to forecast components of allowed revenue including mod, tru, k-factor and incentive revenues. (13) other allowed revenue - other allowed revenue primarily consists of pass through true-ups and 5 per residential customer reduction. for a discussion on property tax true-ups, see recovery of pass through costs in " (6) other revenue included in base revenue " above. in the 2016/17 regulatory year, wpd recovered a 5 per residential network customer reduction given through reduced tariffs in 2014/15. as a result, revenues were positively affected in calendar years 2017 and 2016 by 13 million and 25 million. (14) gaap operating revenue - operating revenue under gaap primarily consists of allowed revenue that has been collected in the calendar year converted to u.s. dollars. it also includes miscellaneous revenue primarily from engineering recharge work and ancillary activity revenue. engineering recharge is work performed for a third party by wpd which is not for general network maintenance or to increase reliability. examples are diversions and running new lines and equipment for a new housing complex. ancillary activity revenue includes revenue primarily from wpd's telecoms and property companies. for additional information on ancillary activity revenue, see footnote c in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operation - reconciliation of adjusted gross margins." the amounts of miscellaneous revenue for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 115 million, 90 million and 84 million. the margin or profit on these activities; however, was not significant. (15) currency hedging - earnings generated by ppl's u.k. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. due to the significant earnings contributed from wpd, ppl enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the gbp versus the u.s. dollar. these hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under gaap. see "overview- financial and operational developments - u.k. membership in european union" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for a discussion of u.k. earnings hedging activity. gaap accounting implications : as the regulatory model in the u.k. is incentive based rather than a cost recovery model, wpd is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by gaap. therefore, the accounting treatment for the differences in the amounts collected in revenues and the amounts recorded for expenses related to depreciation, pensions, cost of debt and income taxes, and the adjustments to base revenue and/or allowed revenue are evaluated primarily based on revenue recognition guidance. see "revenue recognition" in note 1 to the financial statements for additional information. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our u.k. regulated segment" for additional information on the risks associated with the u.k. regulated segment. riio-2 framework on march 7, 2018, ofgem issued its consultation document on the riio-2 framework, which covers all u.k. gas and electricity transmission and distribution price controls. the current electricity distribution price control, riio-ed1, continues through march 31, 2023 and will not be impacted by this riio-2 consultation process. ofgem consulted on a wide range of issues, including cost of debt and equity methodologies, the length of the price control period, indexation methodologies, innovation, stakeholder engagement in the business planning process and performance incentive mechanisms. the purpose of the riio-2 framework consultation was to build on lessons learned from the current price controls while supporting low costs to 11 table of contents consumers, improved customer service and reliability, and the u.k.'s continued shift to a low-carbon future. comments on the riio-2 framework were due in may 2018. on july 30, 2018, ofgem published its decision following its riio-2 framework consultation after consideration of comments received. ofgem confirmed the following points in the decision document: there will be a five-year default length for the price control period, compared to eight years in the current riio-ed1 price control. there is intent to shift the inflation index used for calculating rav and allowed returns from rpi to cpih. ofgem stated overall, consumers and investors as a whole will be neither better nor worse off in net present value terms as a result of the shift to cpih and a transition period may be required. there will be no change to the existing depreciation policy of using economic asset lives as the basis for depreciating rav as part of base revenue calculations. wpd is currently transitioning to 45 year asset lives for new additions in riio-ed1 based on ofgem's extensive review of asset lives in riio-ed1. ofgem will retain the option for fast-tracking for electricity distribution companies only. fast tracking will be further considered as part of the electricity distribution sector specific consultation. a new enhanced engagement model will be introduced which will require distribution companies to set up a customer engagement group to provide ofgem with a public report of their views on the companies' business plans from the perspective of local stakeholders. ofgem will also establish an independent riio-2 challenge group comprised of consumer experts to provide ofgem with a public report on companies' business plans. ofgem intends to expand the role of competition for projects that are new, separable and high value. wpd does not currently have any planned projects that would meet the high value threshold. a focus of riio-2 will be on whole-system outcomes. ofgem envisions network companies and system operators working together to ensure the energy system as a whole is efficient and delivers best value to consumers. ofgem is undertaking further work to clarify the definition of whole-system and the appropriate roles of the network companies in supporting the energy transition. ofgem also indicated further work is needed on other price control principles, including but not limited to, cost of equity, cost of debt, financeability and incentives with decisions on these items expected to be made in the sector specific consultations or within the individual company business plan submissions. in december 2018, the promulgation of sector specific price controls began with ofgem publishing its consultation related to its riio-2 price controls for the gas distribution, gas transmission and electricity transmission operators that will be effective from april 2021 to march 2026. this current consultation does not apply directly to electricity distribution network operators although some decisions will be precedent setting. the electricity distribution price control work is scheduled to begin in 2020, at which time ofgem plans to publish its riio-ed2 strategy consultation document. although the electricity distribution consultation does not commence until 2020, wpd is engaged in the riio-2 process and will be responding to the december 2018 consultation document. ppl cannot predict the outcome of this process or the long-term impact it or the final riio-ed2 regulations will have on its financial condition or results of operations. kentucky regulated segment (ppl) consists of the operations of lke, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of lg&amp;e and ku. in addition, certain acquisition-related financing costs are allocated to the kentucky regulated segment. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lg&amp;e and ku, direct subsidiaries of lke, are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky and, in ku's case, also virginia. lg&amp;e also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. lg&amp;e provides electric service to approximately 414,000 customers in louisville and adjacent areas in kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 328,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in kentucky. ku provides electric service to approximately 527,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western kentucky and approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern virginia, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. ku also sells wholesale electricity to 10 municipalities in kentucky under load following contracts. 12 table of contents details of operating revenues, in millions, by customer class for the years ended december 31 are shown below. 2018 2017 2016 revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue revenue % of revenue lke commercial $ 858 27 $ 854 27 $ 834 27 industrial 566 18 603 19 601 19 residential 1,313 41 1,259 40 1,261 40 other (a) 293 9 280 9 288 9 wholesale - municipal 105 3 112 4 116 4 wholesale - other (b) 79 2 48 1 41 1 total $ 3,214 100 $ 3,156 100 $ 3,141 100 (a) primarily includes revenues from street lighting and other public authorities.

(b) this generation represents increases for lke, lg&amp;e and ku of 5.7% , 5% and 6.2% from 2017 output. the majority of lg&amp;e's and ku's generated electricity was used to supply their retail and ku's municipal customer base. lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail and municipal customers. when lg&amp;e has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of ku, ku purchases electricity from lg&amp;e and vice versa. as a result of environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, ku anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the e.w. brown plant in 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 mw. in 2016, lg&amp;e and ku completed construction activities and placed into commercial operation a 10 mw solar generating facility at the e.w. brown generating site. additionally, lg&amp;e and ku received approval from the kpsc to develop a 4 mw solar share facility to service a solar share program. the solar share program is an optional, voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the solar share facility. construction is expected to begin, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete. the subscription for the first 500-kilowatt phase was completed in june 2018. construction of the first section has begun and is expected to be operational in the summer of 2019. lg&amp;e and ku continue to market the program and receive interest from customers for the second 500-kilowatt phase. fuel supply coal and natural gas will continue to be the predominant fuel used by lg&amp;e and ku for generation for the foreseeable future. natural gas used for generation is primarily purchased using contractual arrangements separate from lg&amp;e's natural gas distribution operations. natural gas and oil are also used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. 14 table of contents lg&amp;e and ku have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2023 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. for their existing units, lg&amp;e and ku expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western kentucky, southern indiana and southern illinois. lg&amp;e and ku continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from wyoming for blending at trimble county unit 2. coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail. to enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, lg&amp;e and ku have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity with contracts of various durations from 2019 to 2024 on the interstate pipeline serving cane run unit 7. this pipeline also serves the six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the trimble county site as well as four other simple cycle units at the cane run and paddy's run sites. for the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the e.w. brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility being interconnected to two pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability. lg&amp;e and ku have firm contracts for a portion of the natural gas fuel for cane run unit 7 through december 2020. the bulk of the natural gas fuel remains purchased on the spot market. (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) natural gas distribution supply five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 billion cubic feet (bcf), are used in providing natural gas service to lg&amp;e's firm sales customers. natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. without this storage capacity, lg&amp;e would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are expected to be higher. at december 31, 2018 , lg&amp;e had 12 bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $41 million . lg&amp;e has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. these natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. in tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. lg&amp;e purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. lg&amp;e has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by lg&amp;e between 2020 and 2023. total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 mmbtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 mmbtu/day. with this same pipeline, lg&amp;e also has another contract for pipeline capacity through 2026 in the amount of 60,000 mmbtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. lg&amp;e has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 mmbtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2023. lg&amp;e expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in south texas, east texas, north louisiana and arkansas, as well as gas originating in the marcellus and utica production areas. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) transmission lg&amp;e and ku contract with the tennessee valley authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with transerv international, inc. to act as their independent transmission organization. rates lg&amp;e is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc and the ferc, and ku is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc, the ferc and the vscc. lg&amp;e and ku operate under a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff. lg&amp;e's and ku's kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. as such, lg&amp;e and ku generally earn a return on regulatory assets in kentucky. 15 table of contents ku's virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). as all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor and regulatory assets or liabilities recorded for pension and postretirement benefits and aros related to certain ccr impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets. ku's rates to 10 municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). as all regulatory assets and liabilities, except regulatory assets recorded for aros related to ccr impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets. in april 2014, certain municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. ku's service to eight municipalities will terminate effective may 1, 2019. rate case proceedings (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) on september 28, 2018, lg&amp;e and ku filed requests with the kpsc for an increase in annual base electricity rates of approximately $112 million at ku and increases in annual base electricity and gas rates of approximately $35 million and $25 million at lg&amp;e. the proposed base rate increases would result in an electricity rate increase of 6.9% at ku and electricity and gas rate increases of 3% and 7.5% at lg&amp;e. as discussed in the "tcja impact on lg&amp;e and ku rates" section below, lg&amp;e's and ku's applications seek to include applicable changes associated with the tcja in the calculation of the proposed base rates and to terminate the tcja bill credit mechanism when the new base rates go into effect. new rates are expected to become effective on may 1, 2019. the applications are based on a forecasted test year of may 1, 2019 through april 30, 2020 with a requested return-on-equity of 10.42% . a number of parties have been granted intervention requests in the proceeding. data discovery and the filing of written testimony will continue through february 2019 and a hearing is scheduled in march 2019. lg&amp;e and ku cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. (lke and ku) in september 2017, ku filed a request seeking approval from the vscc to increase annual virginia base electricity revenue by $7 million, representing an increase of 10.4%. on march 22, 2018, ku reached a settlement agreement regarding the case, including the impact of the tcja on rates, resulting in an increase in annual virginia base electricity revenue of $2 million. this represents an increase of 2.8% with rates effective june 1, 2018. on may 8, 2018, the vscc issued an order approving the settlement agreement. tcja impact on lg&amp;e and ku rates (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) on december 21, 2017, kentucky industrial utility customers, inc. submitted a complaint with the kpsc against lg&amp;e and ku, as well as other utility companies in kentucky, alleging that their respective rates would no longer be fair, just and reasonable following the enactment of the tcja, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. the complaint requested the kpsc to issue an order requiring lg&amp;e and ku to begin deferring, as of january 1, 2018, the revenue requirement effect of all income tax expense savings resulting from the federal corporate income tax reduction, including the amortization of excess deferred income taxes by recording those savings in a regulatory liability account and establishing a process by which the federal corporate income tax savings will be passed back to customers. on january 29, 2018, lg&amp;e, ku, kentucky industrial utility customers, inc. and the office of the attorney general reached a settlement agreement to commence returning savings related to the tcja to their customers through their ecr, dsm and lg&amp;e's glt rate mechanisms beginning in march 2018 and through a new bill credit mechanism from april 1, 2018 through april 30, 2019 and thereafter until tax-reform related savings are reflected in changes in base rates. the estimated impact of the rate reduction represents approximately $91 million in ku electricity revenues ( $70 million through the new bill credit and $21 million through existing rate mechanisms), $69 million in lg&amp;e electricity revenues ( $49 million through the new bill credit and $20 million through existing rate mechanisms) and $17 million in lg&amp;e gas revenues (substantially all through the new bill credit) for the period january 2018 through april 2019. 16 table of contents on march 20, 2018, the kpsc issued an order approving, with certain modifications, the settlement agreement reached between lg&amp;e, ku, kentucky industrial utility customers, inc. and the office of the attorney general. the kpsc estimates that, pursuant to its modifications, electricity revenues would incorporate reductions of approximately $108 million for ku ( $87 million through the new bill credit and $21 million through existing rate mechanisms) and $79 million for lg&amp;e ( $59 million through the new bill credit and $20 million through existing rate mechanisms). this represents $27 million ( $17 million at ku and $10 million at lg&amp;e) in additional reductions from the amounts proposed by the settlement. the kpsc's modifications to the settlement include certain changes in assumptions or inputs used in assessing tax reform or calculating lg&amp;e's and ku's electricity rates. lg&amp;e gas rate reductions were not modified significantly from the amount included in the settlement agreement. on september 28, 2018, the kpsc issued an order on reconsideration, pursuant to lg&amp;e's and ku's petition, implementing rates reflecting electricity revenue reductions of $101 million for ku ( $80 million through the new bill credit and $21 million through existing rate mechanisms), $74 million for lg&amp;e electricity revenues ( $54 million through the new bill credit and $20 million through existing rate mechanisms) and $16 million lg&amp;e gas revenues (substantially all through the new bill credit) for the period january 2018 through april 2019. this represents lower revenue reduction amounts than the march 20, 2018 order of approximately $13 million ( $7 million at ku and $6 million at lg&amp;e). in january 2018, the vscc ordered ku, as well as other utilities in virginia, to accrue regulatory liabilities reflecting the virginia jurisdictional revenue requirement impacts of the reduced federal corporate tax rate. in march 2018, ku reached a settlement agreement regarding its rate case in virginia. new rates, inclusive of tcja impacts, were effective june 1, 2018. the settlement also stipulates that actual tax savings for the five month period prior to new rates taking effect would be addressed through ku's annual information filing for calendar year 2018. in may 2018, the vscc approved the settlement agreement. the tcja and rate case are not expected to have a significant impact on ku's financial condition or results of operations related to virginia. on november 15, 2018, the ferc issued a policy statement which stated that the appropriate ratemaking treatment for changes in accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of the tcja will be addressed in a notice of proposed rulemaking. also on november 15, 2018, the ferc issued the notice of proposed rulemaking which proposes that public utility transmission providers include mechanisms in their formula rates to deduct excess accumulated deferred income taxes from, or add deficient accumulated deferred income taxes to, rate base and adjust their income tax allowances by amortized excess or deficient accumulated deferred income taxes. the notice of proposed rulemaking did not prescribe the mechanism companies should use to adjust their formula rates. lg&amp;e and ku are currently assessing the notice of proposed rulemaking and are continuing to monitor guidance issued by the ferc. on february 5, 2019, in connection with a separate element of federal and kentucky state tax reform effects, lg&amp;e and ku filed a request with the ferc to amend their transmission formula rates, effective june 1, 2019, to incorporate reductions to corporate income tax rates as a result of the tcja and hb 487. lg&amp;e and ku do not anticipate the impact of the tcja related to their ferc-jurisdictional rates to be significant. see note 7 to the financial statements for additional information on rate mechanisms. pennsylvania regulated segment (ppl) consists of ppl electric, a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity. (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central pennsylvania. ppl electric also provides electricity to retail customers in this territory as a plr under the customer choice act. 17 table of contents details of revenues, in millions, by customer class for the years ended december

mechanisms, pole attachment revenues and street lighting, offset by contra revenue associated with the network integration transmission service expense. franchise, licenses and other regulations ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies, which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. competition pursuant to authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. pursuant to the customer choice act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in pennsylvania, and ppl electric does not own or operate any generation facilities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. rates and regulation transmission ppl electric's transmission facilities are within pjm, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. pjm serves as a ferc-approved regional transmission operator (rto) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. in addition to operating the electricity transmission network, pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary objective of any rto is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the rto directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. certain types of transmission investments are subject to competitive processes outlined in the pjm tariff. as a transmission owner, ppl electric's transmission revenues are recovered through pjm and billed in accordance with a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. under this formula, rates are put into effect in june of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in ppl electric's annual ferc form 1, filed under the ferc's uniform system of accounts. any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. any change in the prior year ppl zonal peak load billing factor applied on january 1st of each year, will result in an increase or decrease in revenue until the next annual rate update goes into effect on june 1st of that same year. 18 table of contents as a plr, ppl electric also purchases transmission services from pjm. see "plr" below. see note 7 to the financial statements for additional information on rate mechanisms. distribution ppl electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base. therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the puc. currently, ppl electric's smart meter rider and the dsic are the only riders authorized to earn a return. certain operating expenses are also included in ppl electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes. pennsylvania's alternative energy portfolio standard (aeps) requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania. under the default service procurement plans approved by the puc, ppl electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the aeps. act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new plr generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing aeps. act 11 authorizes the puc to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a dsic. such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to ppl electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. ppl electric has utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in its 2015 base rate proceeding. ppl has had the ability to utilize the dsic recovery mechanism since july 2013. see note 7 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129 and other legislative and regulatory impacts. plr the customer choice act requires electric distribution companies (edcs), including ppl electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the puc to act as a plr of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the plr pursuant to puc regulations. in 2018, the following average percentages of ppl electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 47% of residential, 83% of small commercial and industrial and 98% of large commercial and industrial customers. the puc continues to favor expanding the competitive market for electricity. ppl electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period june 2015 through may 2017, which included four solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in april and october. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period june 2017 through may 2021, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in april and october. pursuant to both the current and future plans, ppl electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential customers and commercial and industrial customers who elect to take that service from ppl electric. these solicitations include a mix of 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential and small commercial and industrial customers, and 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and industrial customers to fulfill ppl electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a plr. numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in ppl electric's service territory. as the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for ppl electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers. see note 7 to the financial statements for additional information regarding act 129 and other legislative and regulatory impacts. 19 table of contents tcja impact on ppl electric rates on february 12, 2018, the puc issued a secretarial letter requesting certain information from regulated utilities and inviting comment from interested parties on potential revision to customer rates as a result of enactment of the tcja. ppl electric submitted its response to the secretarial letter on march 9, 2018. on march 15, 2018, the puc issued a temporary rates order to allow time to determine the manner in which rates could be adjusted in response to the tcja. the puc issued another temporary rates order on may 17, 2018 to address the impact of the tcja and indicated that utilities without a currently pending general rate proceeding would receive a utility specific order. the puc issued an order specific to ppl electric on may 17, 2018 that required ppl electric to file a tariff or tariff supplement by june 15, 2018 to establish (a) temporary rates to be effective july 1, 2018, and (b) to record a deferred regulatory liability to reflect the tax savings associated with the tcja for the period january 1 through june 30, 2018. on june 8, 2018, ppl electric submitted a petition to the puc to charge a negative surcharge of 7.05% to reflect the estimated 2018 tax savings associated with the tcja. the puc approved ppl electric's petition on june 14, 2018 and ppl electric filed a tariff on june 15, 2018 reflecting the increased negative surcharge. ppl electric recorded a $41 million noncurrent regulatory liability and a corresponding reduction of revenue to be distributed to customers pursuant to a future rate adjustment related to the period january 1, 2018 through june 30, 2018. on march 15, 2018, the ferc issued a notice of inquiry seeking information on whether and how it should address changes to ferc-jurisdictional rates relating to accumulated deferred income taxes and bonus depreciation resulting from passage of the tcja. on march 16, 2018, ppl electric filed a waiver request, pursuant to rule 207(a)(5) of the rules of practice and procedure of the ferc, to accelerate incorporation of the changes to the federal corporate income tax rate in its transmission formula rate commencing on june 1, 2018 rather than allowing the tcja tax rate reduction to be initially incorporated in ppl electric's june 1, 2019 transmission formula rate. the waiver was approved on april 23, 2018 and ppl electric submitted its transmission formula rate, reflecting the tcja rate reduction, on april 27, 2018. in addition, on may 21, 2018, ppl electric, as part of a pjm transmission owners joint filing, submitted comments in response to the ferc's march 15, 2018 notice of inquiry. the filing requested guidance on how the reduction in accumulated deferred income taxes, resulting from the tcja reduced federal corporate income tax rate, should be treated for ratemaking purposes. on november 15, 2018, the ferc issued a policy statement which stated that the appropriate ratemaking treatment for changes in accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of the tcja will be addressed in a notice of proposed rulemaking. also on november 15, 2018, the ferc issued the notice of proposed rulemaking which proposes that public utility transmission providers should include mechanisms in their formula rates to deduct excess accumulated deferred income taxes from, or add deficient accumulated deferred income taxes to, rate base and adjust their income tax allowances by amortized excess or deficient accumulated deferred income taxes. the notice of proposed rulemaking did not prescribe the mechanism companies should use to adjust their formula rates. ppl electric is currently assessing the notice of proposed rulemaking and is continuing to monitor guidance issued by the ferc. the changes, related to accumulated deferred income taxes impacting the transmission formula rate revenues, have not been significant since the new rate went into effect on june 1, 2018. (ppl) corporate and other ppl services provides ppl subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. the costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees or a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs. ppl capital funding, ppl's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of ppl and certain subsidiaries. ppl's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through ppl capital funding, that enables ppl to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of ppl's rated companies. as a result, ppl plans to utilize ppl capital funding as a source of capital in future financings, in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies. unlike ppl services, ppl capital funding's costs are not generally charged to ppl subsidiaries. costs are charged directly to ppl. however, ppl capital funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of lke and wpd midlands and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the kentucky regulated and u.k. regulated segments. the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other ppl capital funding securities, have been assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of ppl management's assessment of segment performance. the financing costs associated primarily with ppl capital funding's securities issuances beginning in 2013, with certain exceptions, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment. 20 table of contents during the second quarter of 2018, ppl completed the acquisition of all the outstanding membership interests of safari energy, a privately held provider of solar energy solutions for commercial customers in the u.s. the acquisition is not material to ppl and the financial results of safari energy are reported within corporate and other. (all registrants) seasonality the demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. as a result, the registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when unpredictable weather conditions make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned. see "environmental matters" in note 13 to the financial statements for additional information regarding climate change. financial condition see "financial condition"

full-time employees and employees represented by labor unions. total full-time employees number of union employees percentage of total workforce ppl 12,444 5,970 48 % ppl electric 1,674 1,014 61 % lke 3,504 781 22 % lg&amp;e 1,028 663 64 % ku 904 118 13 % ppl's domestic workforce has 1,924 employees, or 33%, that are members of labor unions. wpd has 4,046 employees who are members of labor unions (or 61% of ppl's u.k. workforce). wpd recognizes four unions, the largest of which represents 41% of its union workforce. wpd's electricity business agreement, which covers 3,989 union employees, may be amended by agreement between wpd and the unions and can be terminated with 12 months' notice by either side. 21 table of contents cybersecurity management the registrants and their subsidiaries are subject to risks from cyber-attacks that have the potential to cause significant interruptions to the operation of their businesses. the frequency of these attempted intrusions has increased in recent years and the sources, motivations and techniques of attack continue to evolve and change rapidly. ppl has undertaken a variety of actions to monitor and address cyber-related risks. cybersecurity and the effectiveness of ppl's cybersecurity strategy are regular topics of discussion at board meetings. ppl's strategy for managing cyber-related risks is risk-based and, where appropriate, integrated within ppl's enterprise risk management processes. ppl's chief information security officer (ciso), who reports directly to the chief executive officer, leads a dedicated cybersecurity team and is responsible for the design, implementation, and execution of cyber-risk management strategy. among other things, the ciso and the cybersecurity team actively monitor the registrants' systems, regularly review policies, compliance, regulations and best practices, perform penetration testing, lead response exercises and internal campaigns, and provide training and communication across the organization to strengthen secure behavior. the cybersecurity team also routinely participates in industry-wide programs to further information sharing, intelligence gathering, and unity of effort in responding to potential or actual attacks. in addition, in 2018, ppl revised and formalized its internal policy and procedures for communicating cybersecurity incidents on an enterprise-wide basis. in addition to these enterprise-wide initiatives, ppl's kentucky and pennsylvania operations are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cybersecurity requirements that are developed and enforced by nerc and approved by ferc to protect grid security and reliability. finally, ppl purchases insurance to protect against a wide range of costs that could be incurred in connection with cyber-related incidents. there can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be effective to prevent interruption of services or other damage to the registrants' businesses or operations or that ppl's insurance coverage will cover all costs incurred in connection with any cyber-related incident. available information ppl's internet website is www.pplweb.com. under the investors heading of that website, ppl provides access to all sec filings of the registrants (including annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(d) or 15(d)) free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec. additionally, the registrants' filings are available at the sec's website (www.sec.gov). 22 table of contents item 1a. risk factors the registrants face various risks associated with their businesses. our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. in addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 13 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. as used in this item 1a., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or ppl electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania regulated segment discussion, or lke and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the kentucky regulated segment discussion. (ppl) risks related to our u.k. segment our u.k. distribution business contributes a significant amount of ppl's earnings and exposes us to the following additional risks related to operating outside the u.s., including risks associated with changes in u.k. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions and political conditions and policies of the u.k. government and the european union. these risks may adversely impact the results of operations of our u.k. distribution business or affect our ability to access u.k. revenues for payment of distributions or for other corporate purposes in the u.s. changes in laws or regulations relating to u.k. operations, including rate regulations beginning in april 2023 under riio-ed2, operational performance and tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; regulatory reviews of tariffs for dnos; changes in labor relations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; changes in u.s. tax law applicable to taxation of foreign earnings; compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws; and prolonged periods of low inflation or deflation. ppl's earnings may be adversely affected in the event the u.k. withdraws from the european union. in 2018, approximately 61% of ppl's net income was generated from its u.k. businesses. significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the financial, economic and other consequences of a withdrawal by the u.k. from the european union, including the outcome of negotiations between the u.k. and european union as to the terms of the withdrawal. ppl cannot predict the impact, in either the short-term or long-term, on foreign exchange rates or ppl's financial condition that may be experienced as a result of the actions taken by the u.k. government to withdraw from the european union, although such impacts could be material. we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks because a significant portion of our cash flows and reported earnings are currently generated by our u.k. business operations. these risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value of the british pound sterling and the u.s. dollar between the time we initially invest u.s. dollars in our u.k. businesses, and our strategy to hedge against such changes, and the time that cash is repatriated to the u.s. from the u.k., including cash flows from our u.k. businesses that may be distributed to ppl or used for repayments of intercompany loans or other general corporate purposes. in addition, ppl's consolidated reported earnings on a gaap basis may be subject to earnings translation risk, which is the result of the conversion of earnings as reported in our u.k. businesses on a british pound sterling basis to a u.s. dollar basis in accordance with gaap requirements. our u.k. segment's earnings are subject to variability based on fluctuations in rpi, which is a measure of inflation. in riio-ed1, wpd's base revenue was established by ofgem based on 2012/13 prices. base revenue is subsequently adjusted to reflect any increase or decrease in rpi for each year to determine the amount of revenue wpd can collect in tariffs. the rpi is forecasted annually by hm treasury and subject to true-up in subsequent years. consequently, the fluctuations between 23 table of contents forecasted and actual rpi can result in variances in base revenue. although wpd also has debt that is indexed to rpi and certain components of operations and maintenance expense are affected by inflation, these may not offset changes in base revenue and timing of such offsets would likely not be correlated precisely with the calendar year in which the variance in demand revenue was initially incurred. further, as rav is indexed to rpi under u.k. rate regulations, a reduction in rpi could adversely affect a borrower's debt-to-rav ratio, potentially limiting future borrowings at wpd's holding company. our u.k. delivery business is subject to revenue variability based on operational performance. our u.k. delivery businesses operate under an incentive-based regulatory framework. managing operational risk and delivering agreed-upon performance are critical to the u.k. regulated segment's financial performance. disruption to these distribution networks could reduce profitability both directly by incurring costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that ofgem administers relating to customer service levels. our ability to collect current levels of pension deficit funding for certain wpd pension plans after march 2021 is uncertain. wpd recovers approximately 80% of pension deficit funding for certain of wpd's defined benefit pension plans in conjunction with actual costs under the riio-ed1 price control. the pension deficit is determined by the pension trustees on a triennial basis in accordance with their funding requirements. pension deficit funding recovered in revenues was 147 million, 142 million and 139 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. wpd expects similar amounts to be collected in revenues through march 31, 2021, but cannot predict amounts that will be collected in revenues beyond then as the plans are approaching a fully funded status. the next triennial pension review will commence in march 2019 and is expected to conclude by the end of 2020. a failure by any of our u.k. regulated businesses to comply with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by ofgem that could have an adverse impact on ppl. ofgem has powers to levy fines of up to ten percent of revenue for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may be revoked. ofgem also has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license and there can be no assurance that a restrictive modification will not be introduced in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the u.k. regulated businesses and ppl. risks related to all segments ( all registrants ) the operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risks. numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. the operation of our transmission and distribution systems, as well as our generation plants, are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that these systems could be the target of disruptive actions by terrorists or criminals or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. as a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to our reputation. in addition, under the energy policy act of 2005, users, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system, including ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by nerc and serc and enforced by ferc. as an operator of natural gas distribution systems, lg&amp;e is also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the u.s. department of transportation. failure to comply with these standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of the standards. we are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations. changes in tax law, including the december 2017 enactment of the tcja, as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. we are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, property, gross receipts, franchise, sales and use, employment-related and other taxes. we also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits and tax credits. due to the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered. we cannot predict changes in tax law or regulation or the effect of any such changes on our businesses. any such changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and 24 table of contents cash flows. we have completed or made reasonable estimates of the effects of the tcja reflected in our december 31, 2018 financial statements, and we continue to evaluate the application of various components of the law in the calculation of income tax expense. increases in electricity prices and/or a weak economy, can lead to changes in legislative and regulatory policy, including the promotion of energy efficiency, conservation and distributed generation or self-generation, which may adversely impact our business. energy consumption is significantly impacted by overall levels of economic activity and costs of energy supplies. economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs can lead to changes in or the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency, alternative and renewable energy sources, and distributed or self-generation by customers. this focus on conservation, energy efficiency and self-generation may result in a decline in electricity demand, which could adversely affect our business. we could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our credit ratings, adverse credit market conditions or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets. in the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt service and operating needs. as a capital-intensive business, we are sensitive to developments in interest rates, credit rating considerations, insurance, security or collateral requirements, market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased availability of credit. in addition, certain sources of debt and equity capital have expressed reservations about investing in companies that rely on fossil fuels. if sources of our capital are reduced, capital costs could increase materially. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. credit ratings assigned by moody's and s&amp;p to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. a ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund liquidity needs and access new long-term debt at acceptable interest rates. see "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - ratings triggers" for additional information on the financial impact of a downgrade in our credit ratings. our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of extreme weather conditions. our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions diverge adversely from seasonal norms. operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters. weather and these other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs. storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues and increase expenses, due to reduced usage and restoration costs. our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change. climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electricity. in addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs to prepare for or respond to these effects. these or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electricity, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies. reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. also, 25 table of contents demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered by consumers' preferences or market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage. we cannot predict the outcome of legal proceedings or investigations related to our businesses in which we are periodically involved. an unfavorable outcome or determination in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and periodically are subject to state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in note 7 to the financial statements and in "legal matters," "regulatory issues" and "environmental matters" in note 13 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting and reducing our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, inflation rates, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. we may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations. in connection with various divestitures, and certain other transactions, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities. these indemnities and guarantees relate, among other things, to liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated a divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture. see "guarantees and other assurances" in note 13 to the financial statements. we are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution operations. the conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties. our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses and decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial performance. operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. these events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently and lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance costs, which may not be recoverable from customers. planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. although we maintain customary insurance coverage for certain of these risks, no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us in the event losses occur. 26 table of contents we are required to obtain, and to comply with, government permits and approvals. we are required to obtain, and to comply with, numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from governmental agencies. the process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex and can sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which the permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. in addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals, or failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, may result in the delay or temporary suspension of our operations and electricity sales or the curtailment of our power delivery and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions. although various regulators routinely renew existing licenses, renewal could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including failure to provide adequate financial assurance for closure; failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permit conditions; local community, political or other opposition; and executive, legislative or regulatory action. our cost or inability to obtain and comply with the permits and approvals required for our operations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows. in addition, new environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed interpretations of existing laws may elicit claims that historical routine modification activities at our facilities violated applicable laws and regulations. in addition to the possible imposition of fines in such cases, we may be required to undertake significant capital investments in pollution control technology and obtain additional operating permits or approvals, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. war, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business. war, terrorist attacks and unrest have caused and may continue to cause instability in the world's financial and commercial markets and have contributed to high levels of volatility in prices for oil and gas. in addition, unrest in the middle east could lead to acts of terrorism in the united states, the united kingdom or elsewhere, and acts of terrorism could be directed against companies such as ours. armed conflicts and terrorism and their effects on us or our markets may significantly affect our business and results of operations in the future. in addition, we may incur increased costs for security, including additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident. we are subject to counterparty performance, credit or other risk in their provision of goods or services to us, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities or conduct business activities. we purchase from a variety of suppliers energy, capacity, fuel, natural gas, transmission service and certain commodities used in the physical operation of our businesses, as well as goods or services, including information technology rights and services, used in the administration of our businesses. delivery of these goods and services is dependent on the continuing operational performance and financial viability of our contractual counterparties and also the markets, infrastructure or third-parties they use to provide such goods and services to us. as a result, we are subject to the risks of disruptions, curtailments or increased costs in the operation of our businesses if such goods or services are unavailable or become subject to price spikes or if a counterparty fails to perform. such disruptions could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities or deliver our services and collect our revenues, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. the performance of coal markets and producers may be the subject of increased counterparty risk to lke, lg&amp;e and ku currently due to weaknesses in such markets and suppliers. the coal industry is subject to increasing competitive pressures from natural gas markets and new or more stringent environmental regulation, including greenhouse gases or other air emissions, combustion byproducts and water inputs or discharges. consequently, the coal industry faces increased production costs or closed customer markets. we are subject to the risk that our workforce and its knowledge base may become depleted in coming years. we are experiencing an increase in attrition due primarily to the number of retiring employees, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed personnel, and to attract and retain new personnel, with appropriate skills and experience, due to a declining trend in the number of available skilled workers and an increase in competition for such workers. 27 table of contents (ppl and lke) risk related to registrant holding companies ppl and lke are holding companies and their cash flows and ability to meet their obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and ppl's ability to pay dividends, largely depends on the financial performance of their respective subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries. ppl and lke are holding companies and conduct their operations primarily through subsidiaries. substantially all of the consolidated assets of these registrants are held by their subsidiaries. accordingly, these registrants' cash flows and ability to meet debt and guaranty obligations, as well as ppl's ability to pay dividends, are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends, distributions, loans, advances or repayment of loans and advances. the subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends or distributions to their parents or to make funds available for such a payment. the ability of the registrants' subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions in the future will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory requirements, including restrictions on the ability of ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku to pay dividends under section 305(a) of the federal power act. because ppl and lke are holding companies, their debt and guaranty obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of their subsidiaries. although certain agreements to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, ppl and lke and their subsidiaries retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities. therefore, ppl's and lke's rights and the rights of their creditors, including rights of debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of their subsidiaries, in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors. (ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku) risks related to domestic regulated utility operations our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to each of the kentucky regulated segment and the pennsylvania regulated segment. set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments. our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments. regulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged. the rates we charge our utility customers must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the ferc, kpsc, vscc and puc. although rate regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full or timely recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments. federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our current or future rate requests, structures or mechanisms, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we receive. although our rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year or on future projected costs, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. our domestic regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will likely require rate increase requests to the regulators. if our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation. in addition to regulating the rates we charge, various federal and state regulatory authorities regulate many aspects of our domestic utility operations, including: the terms and conditions of our service and operations; financial and capital structure matters; 28 table of contents siting, construction and operation of facilities; mandatory reliability and safety standards under the energy policy act of 2005 and other standards of conduct; accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies; tax matters; affiliate transactions; acquisition and disposal of utility assets and issuance of securities; and various other matters, including energy efficiency. such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties which may not be recoverable from customers. our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs. the domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of lg&amp;e and ku) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. the completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including: approval, licensing and permitting; land acquisition and the availability of suitable land; skilled labor or equipment shortages; construction problems or delays, including disputes with third-party intervenors; increases in commodity prices or labor rates; and contractor performance. failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators. we are or may be subject to costs of remediation of environmental contamination at facilities owned or operated by our former subsidiaries. we may be subject to liability for the costs of environmental remediation of property now or formerly owned by us with respect to substances that we may have generated regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during or after the time we owned or operated the facilities. we also have current or previous ownership interests in sites associated with the production of manufactured gas for which we may be liable for additional costs related to investigation, remediation and monitoring of these sites. remediation activities associated with our former manufactured gas plant operations are one source of such costs. citizen groups or others may bring litigation regarding environmental issues including claims of various types, such as property damage, personal injury and citizen challenges to compliance decisions on the enforcement of environmental requirements, which could subject us to penalties, injunctive relief and the cost of litigation. we cannot predict the amount and timing of all future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties) related to such environmental matters, although they could be material. risks specific to kentucky regulated segment ( ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku ) the costs of compliance with, and liabilities under, environmental laws are significant and are subject to continuing changes. extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to lg&amp;e's and ku's generation business, including its air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid wastes, among other business-related activities, and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted but could be material. in addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures, operational changes, permit limitations or other restrictions. at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. market prices for energy and capacity also affect this cost-effectiveness analysis. many of these environmental law considerations are 29 table of contents also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers or customers, such as coal producers, power producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products and demand for our services. ongoing changes in environmental regulations or their implementation requirements and our related compliance strategies entail a number of uncertainties. the environmental standards governing lg&amp;e's and ku's businesses, particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to rulemaking and other regulatory developments, legislative activities and litigation, administrative or permit challenges. revisions to applicable standards, changes in compliance deadlines and invalidation of rules on appeal may require major changes in compliance strategies, operations or assets and adjustments to prior plans. depending on the extent, frequency and timing of such changes, the companies may be subject to inconsistent requirements under multiple regulatory programs, compressed windows for decision-making and short compliance deadlines that may require new technologies or aggressive schedules for construction, permitting and other regulatory approvals. under such circumstances, the companies may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, delayed or incomplete rate recovery or increased costs of implementation. we are subject to operational, regulatory and other risks regarding certain significant developments in environmental regulation affecting coal-fired generation facilities. certain regulatory initiatives have been implemented or are under development which could represent significant developments or changes in environmental regulation and compliance costs or risk associated with the combustion of coal as occurs at lg&amp;e's and ku's coal-fired generation facilities. in particular, such developments include the federal coal combustion residuals regulations governing coal by-product storage activities and the federal effluent limitations guidelines governing water discharge activities. such initiatives have the potential to require significant changes in coal combustion byproduct handling and disposal or water treatment and release facilities and methods from those historically used or currently available. consequently, such developments may involve increased risks relating to the uncertain cost, efficacy and reliability of new technologies, equipment or methods. compliance with such regulations could result in significant changes to lg&amp;e's and ku's operations or commercial practices and material additional capital or operating expenditures. such circumstances could also involve higher risks of compliance violations or of variations in rate or regulatory treatment when compared to existing frameworks. ( ppl, lke and lg&amp;e ) we are subject to operational, regulatory and other risks regarding natural gas supply infrastructure. a natural gas pipeline explosion or associated incident could have a significant impact on lg&amp;e's natural gas operations or result in significant damages and penalties that could have an adverse impact on lg&amp;e's financial position and results of operations. the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration has regulations that govern the design, construction, operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities. failure to comply with these regulations could result in the assessment of fines or penalties against lg&amp;e. these regulations require, among other things, that pipeline operators engage in a pipeline integrity program. depending on the results of these integrity tests and other integrity program activities, we could incur significant and unexpected costs to perform remedial activities on our natural gas infrastructure to ensure our continued safe and reliable operation. recent pipeline incidents in the u.s. have also led to the introduction of proposed rules and possible federal legislative actions which could impose restrictions on lg&amp;e's operations or require more stringent testing to ensure pipeline integrity. implementation of these regulations could increase our costs of compliance with pipeline integrity and safety regulations. risks specific to pennsylvania regulated segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) we face competition for transmission projects, which could adversely affect our rate base growth. ferc order 1000, issued in july 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electric transmission planning activities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to 30 table of contents competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. increased competition can result in lower rate base growth. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to pennsylvania conservation and energy efficiency programs. ppl electric is subject to act 129 which contains requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposes plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing alternative energy portfolio standard. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. utilities not meeting these act 129 requirements are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppl corporation, ppl electric utilities corporation, lg&amp;e

financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ deloitte &amp; touche llp parsippany, new jersey february 14, 2019 100 table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to

statements for additional financial information by segment. (ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) ppl electric has two operating segments that are aggregated into a single reportable segment. lke, lg&amp;e and ku are individually single operating and reportable segments. u.k. regulated segment (ppl) the u.k. regulated segment consists of ppl global, which primarily includes wpd's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of wpd's earnings from british pound sterling into u.s. dollars, and certain costs, such as u.s. income taxes, administrative costs and acquisition-related financing costs. wpd operates four of the 14 ofgem regulated dnos providing electricity service in the u.k. through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries: wpd (south west), wpd (south wales), wpd (east midlands) and wpd (west midlands). the number of network customers (end-users) served by wpd totals 7.9 million across 21,600 square miles in south wales and southwest and central england. see note 3 to the financial statements for revenue information. wpd's operating revenues are translated from gbp to u.s. dollars using the average exchange rates in effect each month. the annual weighted average of the monthly gbp 4 table of contents to u.s. dollar exchange rates used for the years ended december 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $1.28 per gbp, $1.34 per gbp, and $1.28 per gbp. franchise and licenses wpd's operations are regulated by ofgem under the direction of the gas and electricity markets authority. ofgem is a non-ministerial government department and an independent national regulatory authority responsible for protecting the interests of existing and future electricity and natural gas consumers. the electricity act 1989 provides the fundamental framework for electricity companies and established licenses that require each dno to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. wpd's operations are regulated under these licenses which set the outputs wpd needs to deliver to customers and associated revenues wpd is allowed to earn. wpd operates under a regulatory year that begins april 1 and ends march 31 of each year. ofgem has the formal power to propose modifications to each distribution license; however, licensees can appeal such changes to the u.k.'s competition and markets authority. generally, any potential changes to these licenses are reviewed with stakeholders in a formal regulatory consultation process prior to a formal change proposal. competition although wpd operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the u.k., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. wpd's four dnos are, therefore, regulated monopolies, operating under regulatory price controls. customers wpd provides regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third-party energy suppliers who use wpd's networks to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users. wpd bills energy suppliers for this service and the supplier is responsible for billing its end-users. ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the distribution connection and use of system agreement. this agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether a supplier needs to collateralize its payment obligations. wpd's costs make up approximately 17% of a u.k. residential end-user's electricity bill. u.k. regulation and rates overview ofgem has adopted a price control regulatory framework with a balanced objective of enhancing and developing future electricity networks, controlling costs to customers and allowing dnos, such as wpd's dnos, to earn a fair return on their investments. this regulatory structure is focused on outputs and performance in contrast to traditional u.s. utility ratemaking that operates under a cost recovery model. price controls are established based on long-term business plans developed by each dno with substantial input from its stakeholders. to measure the outputs and performance, each dno business plan includes incentive targets that allow for increases and/or reductions in revenues based on operational performance, which are intended to align returns with quality of service, innovation and customer satisfaction. for comparative purposes, amounts listed below are in british pounds sterling, nominal prices and in calendar years unless otherwise noted. key ratemaking mechanisms ppl believes the u.k. electricity utility model is a premium jurisdiction in which to do business due to its significant stakeholder engagement, incentive-based structure and high-quality ratemaking mechanisms. current price control: riio-ed1 wpd currently operates under an eight-year price control called riio-ed1, which commenced for electricity distribution companies on april 1, 2015. the regulatory framework is based on an updated approach for sustainable network regulation known as the "riio" model where revenue = incentives + innovation + outputs. 5 table of contents in coordination with numerous stakeholders, wpd developed its business plans for riio-ed1 building off its historical track record and long-term strategy of delivering industry-leading levels of performance at an efficient level of cost. as a result, all four of wpd's dnos' business plans were accepted by ofgem as "well justified" and were "fast-tracked" ahead of all other dnos. wpd's dnos were rewarded for being fast-tracked with preferential financial incentives, a higher return on equity and higher cost savings retention under their business plans as discussed further below. however, an unintended consequence of being fast-tracked resulted in wpd being disadvantaged from a cost of debt recovery standpoint, as further discussed within (2) real return on capital from rav below. wpd's combined riio-ed1 business plans as accepted by ofgem included funding for total expenditures of approximately 12.8 billion (nominal) over the eight-year period, as follows: totex - 8.5 billion ( 6.8 billion recovered as additions to rav over time ("slow pot"); 1.7 billion recovered in the year spent in the plan ("fast pot")); pension deficit funding - 1.2 billion; cost of debt recovery - 1.0 billion; pass through charges - 1.6 billion (property taxes, ofgem fees and national grid transmissions charges); and corporate income taxes recovery - 0.5 billion. the chart below illustrates the building blocks of allowed revenue and gaap net income for the u.k. regulated segment. the revenue components are shown in either 2012/13 prices or nominal prices, consistent with the formulas ofgem established for riio-ed1. the reference numbers shaded in each block correspond with the descriptions that follow. (a) primarily pension deficit funding, pass through costs, profiling adjustments and legacy price control adjustments. (b) primarily pass through true-ups and 5 per residential customer reduction completed in the regulatory year ended march 31, 2017. (c) reference form 8-k filed february 14, 2020 for u.k. regulated segment gaap statement of income component values. (d) includes the service cost component of gaap pension costs/income. see defined benefits, net periodic defined benefit costs (credits) in note 11 to the financial statements. (e) primarily property taxes. (f) primarily includes the non-service cost (credit) components of gaap pension costs/income and gains and losses on foreign currency hedges. (g) includes wpd interest and $32 million of allocated interest expense to finance the acquisition of wpd midlands. (h) gaap income taxes represent an effective tax rate of 16% for 2019, 17% for 2018, 19% for 2017 and approximately 17% going forward. (1) base revenue the base revenue a dno can collect in each year of the current price control period is the sum of the following, discussed further below: a return on capital from rav; a return of capital from rav (i.e., depreciation); the fast pot recovery, see discussion (4) expenditure efficiency mechanisms below; 6 table of contents an allowance for cash taxes paid less a potential reduction for tax benefits from excess leverage if a dno is levered more than 65% debt/rav; pension deficit funding; certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control; profiling adjustments, see discussion (6) other revenue included in base revenue below; certain legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods, including the information quality incentive (also known as the rolling rav incentive); and fast-track incentive - because wpd's four dnos were fast-tracked through the price control review process for riio-ed1, their base revenue also includes the fast-track incentive. (2) real return on capital from rav real-time returns on cost of regulated equity (real) - ofgem establishes an allowed return on regulated equity that dnos earn in their base business plan revenues as a consideration of the financial parameters for each riio-ed1 business plan. for wpd, the base cost of equity collected in revenues was set at 6.4% (real). base equity returns exclude inflation adjustments, allowances for incentive rewards/penalties and over/under collections driven by cost efficiencies. wpd's dno base equity returns are calculated using an equity ratio of 35% of rav. the equity ratio was reviewed and set during the riio-ed1 business plan process taking various stakeholder impacts into consideration such as costs to consumers, credit ratings and investor needs. the amounts of base real equity return for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 168 million, 160 million and 151 million. indexed cost of debt recovery (real) - as part of wpd's fast-track agreement with ofgem for riio-ed1, wpd collects in revenues an assumed real cost of debt that is derived from a historical 10-year bond index (iboxx) and adjusted annually for inflation. this calculated real cost of debt is then applied to 65% of rav at the dnos to determine the cost of debt revenue recovery. the cost of debt was set at 2.55% in the original "well justified" business plans. the recovery amounts are trued up annually as a component of the mod true-up mechanism described within " (9) mod and inflation true-up (tru) " below. as discussed above, wpd's cost of debt revenue allowances are derived from using a rolling 10-year trailing average of historical 10-year bond index (iboxx); however, the cost of debt revenue allowances for all slow track companies are derived using an extending trailing average of the index. under this approach, the trailing average period used is progressively extended from 10 to 20 years and consequently short-term fluctuations in the interest rate have a less pronounced effect on the regulatory cost of debt applied. therefore, wpd's cost of debt recovery is significantly lower than it would have been had it been derived under the approach used for the slow-track companies. over the 8-year riio-ed1 period wpd is expected to under-recover its cost of debt at the four dnos, based upon the latest inflation assumptions and projected 10-year iboxx bond indices rates, by approximately 231 million primarily driven by the previously discussed differing cost of debt recovery calculations. under the terms of the fast track process, fast tracked companies were not supposed to be disadvantaged financially to slow track companies. it is currently uncertain, however, if wpd will be able to recover any of this under-recovery in the next price control period, riio-ed2, beginning april 1, 2023. interest costs relating to long-term debt issued at wpd's holding companies are not recovered in revenues and for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 57 million, 46 million and 49 million. (3) recovery of depreciation in revenues - recovery of depreciation in regulatory revenues is one of the key mechanisms ofgem uses to support financeable business plans that provide incentives to attract the continued substantial investment required in the u.k. differences between gaap and regulatory depreciation exist primarily due to differing assumptions on asset lives and because rav is adjusted for inflation using rpi. compared to asset lives established for gaap, asset lives established for ratemaking are set by ofgem based on economic lives which results in improved dno near-term revenues and cash flows during investment cycles. under u.k. regulation prior to riio-ed1, electric distribution assets were depreciated on a 20-year asset life for the purpose of setting revenues. after review and consultation, ofgem decided to use 45-year asset lives for rav additions after april 1, 2015, with transitional arrangements available for dnos fully demonstrating a need to ensure financeable plans. wpd adopted a transition that has a linear increase in asset lives from 20 to 45 years for additions to rav in each year of riio-ed1 (with additions averaging a life of approximately 35 years over this period), which adds support to its credit metrics. rav additions prior to march 31, 2015 continue to be recovered in revenues over 20 years. the asset lives used to determine depreciation expense for gaap purposes are not the same as those used for the depreciation of the rav in setting revenues and, as such, vary by asset type and are based on the expected useful lives of the assets. 7 table of contents effective january 1, 2015, after completing a review of the useful lives of its distribution network assets, wpd set the weighted average useful lives to 69 years for gaap depreciation expense. because ofgem uses a real cost of capital, the rav and recovery of depreciation are adjusted for inflation using rpi. the inflation revenues collected in this line item help recover the cost of equity and debt returns on a "nominal" basis, compared to the "real" rates used to set the return component of base revenues. this regulatory construct, in combination with the different assets lives used for ratemaking and gaap, results in amounts collected by wpd as recovery of depreciation in revenues being significantly higher than the amounts wpd recorded for depreciation expense under gaap. for 2019, 2018 and 2017, this difference was 450 million, 444 million and 424 million (pre-tax) and positively impacted net income. the difference is expected to continue in the 400 million to 450 million (pre-tax) range at least through 2022 (the last full calendar year of riio-ed1), assuming rpi of approximately 3.0% per year from 2020 through 2022 and based on expected rav additions of approximately 800 million per year to prepare the distribution system for future u.k. energy objectives while maintaining premier levels of reliability and customer service. (4) expenditure efficiency mechanisms - ofgem introduced the concept of totex in riio to ensure all dnos face equal incentives in choosing between operating and capital solutions. totex is split between immediate recovery (called "fast pot") and deferred recovery as an addition to rav (called "slow pot"). the ratio of slow pot to fast pot was determined by each dno in its business plan development. wpd established a totex split of 80% slow pot and 20% fast pot for riio-ed1 to balance maximizing rav growth with immediate cost recovery to support investment grade credit ratings. comparatively, other dnos on average used a ratio of approximately 70% slow pot and 30% fast pot for riio-ed1. ofgem also allows a totex incentive mechanism that is intended to reward dnos for cost efficiency. wpd's dnos are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against their riio-ed1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends. any amounts to be returned to customers are trued up in the aip discussed below. because fast pot cost recovery represents 20% of totex expenditures and certain other costs are recovered in other components of revenue, fast pot will not equal operation and maintenance expenses recorded for gaap purposes. (5) income tax allowance - for price control purposes, wpd collects income tax based on ofgem's notional tax charge, which will not equal the amount of income tax expense recorded for gaap purposes. the following table shows the amount of taxes collected in revenues and recorded under gaap. 2019 2018 2017 taxes collected in revenues 56 58 57 taxes recorded under gaap 167 156 139 (6) other revenue included in base revenue - other revenue included in base revenue primarily consists of pension deficit funding, pass through costs, profiling adjustments and legacy price control adjustments. recovery of annual (normal) pension cost and pension deficit funding - ofgem allows dnos to recover annual (normal) pension costs through the totex allocation, split between the previously described fast pot (immediate recovery) and slow pot recovery (as an addition to rav). the amount of normal pension cost is computed by the pension trustees, using assumptions that differ from those used in calculating pension costs/income under gaap. in addition, the timing of the revenue collection may not match the actual pension payment schedule, resulting in a timing difference of cash flows. in addition, wpd recovers approximately 80% of pension deficit funding for certain of wpd's defined benefit pension plans in conjunction with actual costs similar to the fast pot mechanism. the pension deficit is determined by the pension trustees on a triennial basis in accordance with their funding requirements. pension deficit funding recovered in revenues was 151 million, 147 million and 142 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017. wpd expects similar amounts to be collected in revenues through march 31, 2021, but cannot predict amounts that will be collected in revenues beyond then as the plans are approaching a fully funded status. the current triennial pension review commenced in march 2019 and is expected to conclude by the end of 2020. see note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on pension costs/income recognized under gaap. recovery of pass through costs - wpd recovers certain pass-through costs over which the dno has no control such as property taxes, national grid transmission charges and ofgem fees. although these items are intended to be pass-through charges there could be timing differences, primarily related to property taxes, as to when amounts are collected in revenues and when amounts are expensed in the statements of income. wpd over-collected property taxes by 37 million, 38 million and 19 8 table of contents million in 2019, 2018 and 2017. wpd expects to continue to over-recover property taxes until the end of riio-ed1. amounts under-or over-recovered in revenues in a regulatory year are trued up through revenues two regulatory years later. profiling adjustments - ofgem permitted dnos the flexibility to make profiling adjustments to their base revenues within their business plans. these adjustments do not affect the total base revenue in real terms over the eight-year price control period, but change the year in which the revenue is collected. in the first year of riio-ed1, wpd's base revenue decreased by 11.8% compared to the final year of the prior price control period (dpcr5), primarily due to a change in profiling methodology and a lower weighted-average cost of capital. base revenue then increased by approximately 2.5% per annum before inflation for regulatory years up to march 31, 2019 and will increase by approximately 1% per annum before inflation for each regulatory year thereafter for the remainder of riio-ed1. (7) incentives for developing high-quality business plans (known as fast-tracking) - for riio-ed1, ofgem incentivized dnos with certain financial rewards to develop "well justified" business plans that drive value to customers. wpd was awarded the following fast-track incentives: an annual fast-track revenue incentive worth 2.5% of totex (approximately 25 million annually for wpd); a real cost of equity rate of 6.4% compared to 6.0% for slow-tracked dnos; and, cost savings retention was established at 70% for wpd compared to approximately 55% for slow-tracked dnos. (8) allowed revenue - allowed revenue is the amount that a dno can collect from its customers in order to fund its investment requirements. base revenues are adjusted annually during riio-ed1 to arrive at allowed revenues. these adjustments are discussed in sections (9) through (13) below. (9) mod and inflation true-up (tru) mod - riio-ed1 includes an aip that allows future base revenues, agreed with the regulator as part of the price control review, to be updated during the price control period for financial adjustments including taxes, pensions, cost of debt, legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods and adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the totex incentive mechanism (tim). the aip calculates an incremental change to base revenue, known as the "mod" adjustment. the mod provided by ofgem in november 2016 included the tim for the 2015/16 regulatory year, as well as the cost of debt calculation based on the 10-year trailing average to october 2016. this mod of 12 million reduced base revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by 8 million and 4 million. the mod provided by ofgem in november 2017 for the 2016/17 regulatory year was a 39 million reduction to revenue that reduced base revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by 26 million and 13 million. the mod provided by ofgem in november 2018 for the 2017/18 regulatory year was a 42 million reduction to revenue that reduced base revenue in calendar year 2019 by 28 million and will reduce base revenue in calendar year 2020 by 14 million. the mod provided by ofgem in november 2019 for the 2018/19 regulatory year was an 81 million reduction to revenue that will reduce base revenue in calendar years 2020 and 2021 by 54 million and 27 million. the projected mod for the 2019/20 regulatory year is a 128 million reduction to revenue that is expected to reduce base revenue in calendar years 2021 and 2022 by 85 million and 43 million. tru - as discussed below in " (10) inflation adjusted, multi-year rate cycle ," the base revenue for the riio-ed1 period was set based on 2012/13 prices. therefore, an inflation factor as determined by forecasted rpi, provided by hm treasury, is applied to base revenue. forecasted rpi is trued up to actuals and affects future base revenue two regulatory years later. this revenue change is called the "tru" adjustment. the tru for the 2015/16 regulatory year was a 31 million reduction to revenue that reduced base revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by 21 million and 10 million. the tru for the 2016/17 regulatory year was a 6 million reduction to revenue that reduced base revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by 4 million and 2 million. 9 table of contents the tru for the 2017/18 regulatory year was a 4 million increase to revenue that increased base revenue in calendar year 2019 by 3 million and will increase base revenue in calendar year 2020 by 1 million. the tru for the 2018/19 regulatory year was a 2 million reduction to revenue that will reduce base revenue in calendar years 2020 and 2021 by 1 million. the projected tru for the 2019/20 regulatory year is a 13 million reduction to revenue that is expected to reduce base revenue in calendar years 2021 and 2022 by 9 million and 4 million. as both mod and tru are changes to future base revenues as determined by ofgem, these adjustments are recognized as a component of revenues in future years in which service is provided and revenues are collected or returned to customers. (10) inflation adjusted, multi-year rate cycle - ofgem built its price control framework to better coincide with the long-term nature of electricity distribution investments. the current price control for electricity distribution is for the eight-year period from april 1, 2015 through march 31, 2023. this both required and enabled wpd to design a base business plan with predictable revenues and expenses over the long-term to drive value for its customers through predetermined outputs and for its investors through preset base returns. a key aspect to the multi-year cycle is an annual inflation adjustment for revenue and cost components, which are inflated using rpi from the base 2012/13 prices used to establish the business plans. consistent with ofgem's formulas, the inflation adjustment is applied to base revenue, mod and tru when determining allowed revenue. this inflation adjustment also has the effect of inflating rav, and real returns are earned on the inflated rav. (11) incentive revenues for strong operational performance and innovation - ofgem has established incentives to provide opportunities for dnos to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. these incentives can result in an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for actual performance against pre-established targets based on past performance. some of the more significant incentives that may affect allowed revenue include the interruptions incentive scheme (iis), the broad measure of customer service (bmcs) and the time to connect (ttc) incentive: the iis has two major components: (1) customer interruptions (cis) and (2) customer minutes lost (cmls), and both are designed to incentivize the dnos to invest in and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages. the bmcs encompasses customer satisfaction in supply interruptions, connections and general inquiries, complaints, stakeholder engagement and delivery of social obligations. the ttc incentive rewards dnos for reducing connection times for minor connections against an ofgem set target. the annual incentives and penalties are reflected in customer rates on a two-year lag from the time they are earned and/or assessed. based on applicable gaap, incentive revenues and penalties are recorded in revenues when they are billed to customers. the following table shows the amount of incentive revenues (in total), primarily from iis, bmcs and ttc that wpd has received and is projected to receive on a calendar year basis: incentive received calendar year ended incentive calendar year ended incentive earned (in millions) included in revenue 2015 79 2017 2016 76 2018 2017 72 2019 2018 78 2020 2019 (a) 75-85 2021 2020 (a) 75-85 2022 (a) reflects projected incentive revenues. (12) correction factor (k-factor) - during the price control period, wpd sets its tariffs to recover allowed revenue. however, in any fiscal period, wpd's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular period. conversely, wpd could over-recover revenue. over- and under-recoveries are subtracted from or added to allowed revenue in future years, known as the "correction factor" or "k-factor." over and under-recovered amounts during riio-ed1 will be refunded/recovered two regulatory years later. the k-factor for the 2015/16 regulatory year was a 4 million under-recovery that increased allowed revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by 3 million and 1 million. the k-factor for the 2016/17 regulatory year was a 23 million over-recovery that reduced allowed revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by 15 million and 8 million. 10 table of contents the k-factor for the 2017/18 regulatory year was a 3 million over-recovery that reduced allowed revenue in calendar year 2019 by 2 million and will reduce allowed revenue in calendar year 2020 by 1 million. the k-factor for the 2018/19 regulatory year was a 16 million over-recovery that will reduce allowed revenue in calendar years 2020 and 2021 by 11 million and 5 million. the projected k-factor for the 2019/20 regulatory year is a 20 million under-recovery that is expected to increase allowed revenue in calendar years 2021 and 2022 by 13 million and 7 million. historically, tariffs have been set a minimum of three months prior to the beginning of the regulatory year (april 1). in 2015, ofgem determined that, beginning with the 2017/18 regulatory year, tariffs would be established a minimum of fifteen months in advance. this change will potentially increase volatility in future revenue forecasts due to the need to forecast components of allowed revenue including mod, tru, k-factor and incentive revenues. (13) other allowed revenue - other allowed revenue primarily consists of pass through true-ups and a 5 per residential customer reduction completed in the regulatory year ended march 31, 2017. for a discussion on property tax true-ups, see recovery of pass through costs in " (6) other revenue included in base revenue " above. in the 2016/17 regulatory year, wpd recovered a 5 per residential network customer reduction given through reduced tariffs in 2014/15. as a result, revenues were positively affected in calendar year 2017 by 13 million. (14) gaap operating revenue - operating revenue under gaap primarily consists of allowed revenue, which has been converted to rates and earned as electricity was delivered in the calendar year, converted to u.s. dollars. it also includes miscellaneous revenue primarily from engineering recharge work and ancillary activity revenue. engineering recharge is work performed for a third party by wpd which is not for general network maintenance or to increase reliability. examples are diversions and running new lines and equipment for a new housing complex. ancillary activity revenue includes revenue primarily from wpd's telecoms and property companies. the amounts of miscellaneous revenue for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 115 million, 115 million and 90 million. the margin or profit on these activities, however, was not significant. (15) currency hedging - earnings generated by ppl's u.k. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. due to the significant earnings contributed from wpd, ppl enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the gbp versus the u.s. dollar. these hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under gaap. see "overview - financial and operational developments - u.k. membership in european union" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for a discussion of u.k. earnings hedging activity. gaap accounting implications as the regulatory model in the u.k. is incentive based rather than a cost recovery model, wpd is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by gaap. therefore, the accounting treatment for the differences in the amounts collected in revenues and the amounts recorded for expenses related to depreciation, pensions, cost of debt and income taxes, and the adjustments to base revenue and/or allowed revenue are evaluated primarily based on revenue recognition guidance. see "revenue recognition" in note 1 to the financial statements for additional information. see "overview - financial and operational developments - riio-2 framework" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information on the riio-2 framework which will commence on april 1, 2023. kentucky regulated segment (ppl) the kentucky regulated segment consists of the operations of lke, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of lg&amp;e and ku. in addition, certain acquisition-related financing costs are allocated to the kentucky regulated segment. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) lg&amp;e and ku, direct subsidiaries of lke, are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in kentucky and, in ku's case, also virginia. lg&amp;e also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in kentucky. lg&amp;e provides electricity service to approximately 418,000 customers in louisville and adjacent areas in kentucky, 11 table of contents covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 329,000 customers in its electricity service area and eight additional counties in kentucky. ku provides electric service to approximately 530,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western kentucky and approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern virginia, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. ku also sells wholesale electricity to two municipalities in kentucky under load following contracts. see note 3 to the financial statements for revenue information. franchises and licenses lg&amp;e and ku provide electricity delivery service, and lg&amp;e provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. competition there are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electricity service areas of lke. from time to time, bills are introduced into the kentucky general assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. neither the kentucky general assembly nor the kpsc has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in kentucky. the nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on lke, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. ku's operations in virginia have been and remain regulated. alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels indirectly impact lg&amp;e's natural gas revenues. marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. lg&amp;e's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity. therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact lg&amp;e's profitability. some large industrial and commercial customers, however, may physically bypass lg&amp;e's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems. power supply at december 31, 2019 , lke owned generating capacity of 7,561 mw, of which 2,786 mw related to lg&amp;e and 4,775 mw related to ku. see "item 2. properties - kentucky regulated segment" for a complete list of lke's generating facilities. the system capacity of lke's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances. during 2019 , lke's power plants generated the following amounts of electricity: gwh fuel source lke lg&amp;e ku coal 25,348 11,336 14,012 gas 6,558 1,608 4,950 hydro 357 251 106 solar 18 7 11 total (a) 32,281 13,202 19,079 (a) this generation represents decreases for lke, lg&amp;e and ku of 6.6% , 3.2% and 8.8% from 2018 output. the majority of lg&amp;e's and ku's generated electricity was used to supply their retail customer bases. lg&amp;e and ku jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their customers. when lg&amp;e has excess generation capacity after serving its own customers and its generation cost is lower than that of ku, ku purchases electricity from lg&amp;e and vice versa. as a result of environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, ku retired two older coal-fired electricity generating units at the e.w. brown plant in february 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 mw. 12 table of contents lg&amp;e and ku received approval from the kpsc to develop a 4 mw solar share facility to service a solar share program. the solar share program is a voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the solar share facility. construction commences, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete. the first 500-kilowatt phase was constructed in 2019. the subscription for the second 500-kilowatt phase was completed in 2019, with expected construction to be completed in 2020. lg&amp;e and ku continue to market the program and have started receiving subscriptions for the third 500-kilowatt phase. on january 23, 2020, lg&amp;e and ku applied to the kpsc for approval of arrangements relating to the purchase of 100 mw of solar power in connection with the green tariff option established in the most recent kentucky base rate cases. pursuant to the agreements, lg&amp;e and ku would purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed third-party solar generation facility and resell the bulk of the power as renewable energy to two large industrial customers and use the remaining power for other customers. the transactions are subject to kpsc approval and other standard conditions. ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku do not anticipate that these arrangements will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition. fuel supply coal and natural gas will continue to be the predominant fuels used by lg&amp;e and ku for generation for the foreseeable future. natural gas used for generation is primarily purchased using contractual arrangements separate from lg&amp;e's natural gas distribution operations. natural gas and oil are also used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties. lg&amp;e and ku have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2024 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. for their existing units, lg&amp;e and ku expect, for the foreseeable future, to purchase most of their coal from western kentucky, southern indiana and southern illinois. lg&amp;e and ku continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from wyoming for blending at trimble county unit 2. coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail. to enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, lg&amp;e and ku have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity with contracts of various durations from 2020 to 2024 on the interstate pipeline serving cane run unit 7. this pipeline also serves the six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the trimble county site as well as three other simple cycle units at the paddy's run site. for the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the e.w. brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility being interconnected to two pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability. lg&amp;e and ku have firm contracts for a portion of the natural gas fuel for cane run unit 7 through february 2022. the bulk of the natural gas fuel remains purchased on the spot market. (ppl, lke and lg&amp;e) natural gas distribution supply five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 billion cubic feet (bcf), are used to provide natural gas service to lg&amp;e's firm sales customers. natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. without this storage capacity, lg&amp;e would need to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are expected to be higher. at december 31, 2019 , lg&amp;e had 12 bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $35 million . lg&amp;e has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. these natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. in tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve lg&amp;e's natural gas customers. 13 table of contents lg&amp;e purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. lg&amp;e has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by lg&amp;e between 2021 and 2025. total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 mmbtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 mmbtu/day. with this same pipeline, lg&amp;e also has another contract for pipeline capacity through 2026 for 60,000 mmbtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. lg&amp;e has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 mmbtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2023. lg&amp;e expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in south texas, east texas, north louisiana and arkansas, as well as gas originating in the marcellus and utica production areas. (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) transmission lg&amp;e and ku contract with the tennessee valley authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with transerv international, inc. to act as their independent transmission organization. rates lg&amp;e is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc and the ferc, and ku is subject to the jurisdiction of the kpsc, the ferc and the vscc. lg&amp;e and ku operate under a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff. lg&amp;e's and ku's kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. as such, lg&amp;e and ku generally earn a return on regulatory assets in kentucky. ku's virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). as all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor and regulatory assets or liabilities recorded for pension and postretirement benefits and aros related to certain ccr impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets. ku's rates to municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). as all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets. in april 2014, certain municipalities submitted notices of termination to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. ku's service to eight municipalities terminated effective april 30, 2019. ku continues to provide service to two municipalities. see "financial and operational developments" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 7 to the financial statements for additional information on current rate proceedings and rate mechanisms. pennsylvania regulated segment (ppl) the pennsylvania regulated segment consists of ppl electric, a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity. (ppl and ppl electric) ppl electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties within eastern and central pennsylvania. ppl electric also provides electricity to retail customers in this territory as a plr under the customer choice act. see note 3 to the financial statements for revenue information. franchise, licenses and other regulations ppl electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the commonwealth of pennsylvania in corporate charters to ppl electric and companies which it has succeeded, and as a result of certification by the puc. ppl electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the commonwealth subject to 14 table of contents certain conditions. in general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the commonwealth. competition pursuant to authorizations from the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the puc, ppl electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. accordingly, ppl electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. pursuant to the customer choice act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in pennsylvania, and ppl electric does not own or operate any generation facilities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. rates and regulation transmission ppl electric's transmission facilities are within pjm, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the mid-atlantic and midwest regions of the u.s. pjm serves as a ferc-approved regional transmission operator (rto) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. in addition to operating the electricity transmission network, pjm also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. a primary objective of any rto is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the rto directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. certain types of transmission investments are subject to competitive processes outlined in the pjm tariff. as a transmission owner, ppl electric's transmission revenues are recovered through pjm and billed in accordance with a ferc-approved open access transmission tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. under this formula, rates are put into effect in june of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in ppl electric's annual ferc form 1, filed under the ferc's uniform system of accounts. any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. any change in the prior year ppl zonal peak load billing factor applied on january 1 of each year will result in an increase or decrease in revenue until the next annual rate update is effective on june 1 of that same year. as a plr, ppl electric also purchases transmission services from pjm. see "plr" below. see note 7 to the financial statements for additional information on rate mechanisms. distribution ppl electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base. therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the puc. currently, ppl electric's smart meter rider and the dsic are the only riders authorized to earn a return. certain operating expenses are also included in ppl electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes. pennsylvania's alternative energy portfolio standard (aeps) requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in pennsylvania. under the default service procurement plans approved by the puc, ppl electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the aeps. act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new plr generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing aeps. 15 table of contents act 11 authorizes the puc to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a dsic. such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to ppl electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. ppl electric utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in its 2015 base rate proceeding. ppl has had the ability to utilize the dsic recovery mechanism since july 2013. see "financial and operational developments" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 7 to the financial statements for additional information on legislative and regulatory matters. plr the customer choice act requires electric distribution companies, including ppl electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the puc, to act as a plr of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the plr pursuant to puc regulations. in 2019, the following average percentages of ppl electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 43% of residential, 82% of small commercial and industrial and 96% of large commercial and industrial customers. the puc continues to favor expanding the competitive market for electricity. ppl electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period june 2015 through may 2017, which included four solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in april and october. the puc approved ppl electric's default service plan for the period june 2017 through may 2021, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in april and october. pursuant to the plans, ppl electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential customers and commercial and industrial customers who elect to take that service from ppl electric. these solicitations include a mix of 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential and small commercial and industrial customers, and 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and industrial customers to fulfill ppl electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a plr. numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in ppl electric's service area. as the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for ppl electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers. corporate and other (ppl) ppl services provides ppl subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. the costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees or a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs. ppl capital funding, ppl's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of ppl and certain subsidiaries. ppl's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through ppl capital funding, that enables ppl to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of ppl's rated companies. as a result, ppl plans to utilize ppl capital funding as a source of capital in future financings, in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies. unlike ppl services, ppl capital funding's costs are not generally charged to ppl subsidiaries. costs are charged directly to ppl. however, ppl capital funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of lke and wpd midlands and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the kentucky regulated and u.k. regulated segments. the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other ppl capital funding securities, have been assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of ppl management's assessment of segment performance. the financing costs associated primarily with ppl capital funding's securities issuances beginning in 2013, with certain exceptions, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment. during the second quarter of 2018, ppl completed the acquisition of all the outstanding membership interests of safari energy, a privately held provider of solar energy solutions for commercial customers in the u.s. the acquisition is not material to ppl and the financial results of safari energy are reported within corporate and other. 16 table of contents environmental matters (all registrants) the registrants are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters. the epa has issued numerous environmental regulations relating to air, water and waste that directly affect the electric power industry. due to these environmental issues, it may be necessary for the registrants to modify or cease certain operations or operation of certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts. in addition, legal challenges to new environmental permits or rules add uncertainty to estimating future costs of complying with such permits and rules. see legal matters in note 13 to the financial statements for a discussion of environmental commitments and contingencies. see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2020 through 2024. lg&amp;e and ku are entitled to recover, through the ecr mechanism, certain costs of complying with the clean air act, as amended, and other federal, state and local environmental requirements applicable to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired generating facilities upon kpsc review. costs not covered by the ecr mechanism for lg&amp;e and ku and all such costs for ppl electric are subject to rate recovery at the discretion of the companies' respective state regulatory authorities, or the ferc, if applicable. wpd's distribution businesses are subject to certain statutory and regulatory environmental requirements. it may be necessary for wpd to incur significant compliance costs, which may be recoverable through rates subject to ofgem approval. because neither wpd nor ppl electric own any generating plants, their exposure to related environmental compliance costs is reduced. ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future proceedings before regulatory authorities. air (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) naaqs the clean air act has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel generation plants. the clean air act requires the epa periodically to establish and review national ambient air quality standards, known as naaqs, for six pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (contributed to by nitrogen oxide emissions), particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. the epa is scheduled to evaluate the current naaqs for particulate matter in 2020. ppl, lke, lg&amp;e, and ku are unable to predict the outcome of future evaluations by the epa and the states with respect to the naaqs for particulate matter. applicable regulations require each state to identify areas within its boundaries that fail to meet the naaqs, (known as nonattainment areas), and develop a state implementation plan to achieve and maintain compliance. in addition, for attainment of ozone and fine particulates standards, certain states, including kentucky, are subject to a regional epa program known as the cross-state air pollution rule (csapr). in january 2018, the epa designated jefferson county, kentucky (louisville) as being in nonattainment with the existing 2015 ozone standard. in december 2018, the epa finalized the csapr "close-out rule," determining that the existing csapr "update rule" for the 2008 ozone naaqs fully addresses applicable states' interstate pollution transport obligations. various states and others challenged the rule in the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit (d.c. circuit). in september 2019, the d.c. circuit granted these petitions and remanded a portion of the csapr update rule to the epa. compliance with the naaqs and related requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls, the costs of which ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku believe are subject to rate recovery. states that are found to contribute significantly to another state's nonattainment with ozone standards are required to establish good neighbor state implementation plans. in october 2019, new york and other interested parties filed a petition for review in the d.c. circuit of appeals challenging the epa's determination that no additional reductions beyond existing and planned controls are necessary to prevent significant interstate impacts. in 2018 and 2019, the epa denied petitions filed by maryland, delaware, and new york alleging that states including kentucky contribute to nonattainment in the petitioning states. 17 table of contents climate change there is continuing world-wide attention focused on issues related to climate change. in 2015, 195 nations, including the u.s., signed the paris agreement on climate, establishing non-binding targets to reduce ghg emissions from both developed and developing nations. in 2017, the president announced a u.s. withdrawal from the paris agreement, which withdrawal would not be complete until november 2020. the president also issued an executive order directing rescission of certain guidance, directives, and prior presidential actions regarding climate change. at present, there are ongoing efforts by various u.s. federal, state, and local governments to assess potential changes to legislation, rules, policies, directives, and other requirements applicable to greenhouse gas emissions. ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku cannot predict the outcome of such assessments. the u.k. has enacted binding carbon reduction requirements that are applicable to wpd. under the u.k. law, wpd must purchase carbon allowances to offset emissions associated with wpd's operations. the cost of these allowances is not significant and is included in wpd's current operating expenses. the epa's affordable clean energy rule in july 2019, the epa repealed the clean power plan and finalized the affordable clean energy (ace) rule which gives states broad latitude to establish emission guidelines providing for plant-specific efficiency upgrades or "heat-rate improvements" to reduce ghg emissions per unit of electricity generated. states are generally allowed three years to submit plans establishing standards of performance, while the epa anticipates that most facilities will be required to demonstrate compliance within two years of plan approval. the epa intends to take additional action to finalize new criteria for determining whether efficiency projects will trigger new source review and thus be subject to more stringent emission controls. various entities have filed petitions for review and petitions for reconsideration. ppl, lke, lg&amp;e, and ku cannot predict the outcome of the pending litigation and regulatory proceedings, but believe that the costs would be subject to rate recovery. water/waste (ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku) clean water act regulations under the federal clean water act dictate permitting and mitigation requirements for facilities and construction projects that impact "waters of the united states." many other requirements relate to power plant operations, including the treatment of pollutants in effluents prior to discharge, the temperature of effluent discharges and the location, design and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities, and standards intended to protect aquatic organisms that become trapped at or pulled through cooling water intake structures at generating facilities. these requirements could impose significant costs for lg&amp;e and ku, which are expected to be subject to rate recovery. clean water act jurisdiction environmental groups and others have claimed that discharges to groundwater from leaking ccr impoundments at power plants are subject to clean water act permitting. a citizen suit raising such claims has been filed against ku with respect to the e.w. brown plant, as discussed under legal matters - e.w. brown environmental claims in note 13 to the financial statements. on april 12, 2019, the epa released regulatory clarification finding that clean water act jurisdiction does not cover such discharges to groundwater. on january 23, 2020, the epa announced a final rule modifying the jurisdictional scope of the clean water act. the announced rule revises the definition of the "waters of the united states," including a revision to exclude groundwater from the definition. additionally, a ruling from the u.s. supreme court in a pending case, likely in the first half of 2020, is expected to provide additional clarification on the scope of clean water act jurisdiction. extending clean water act jurisdiction to discharges to groundwater could potentially subject certain releases from ccr impoundments to additional permitting and remediation requirements, which could impose substantial costs. ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku are unable to predict the outcome or financial impact of current regulatory proceedings and litigation. seepages and groundwater infiltration in addition to the actions described above, lg&amp;e and ku have completed, or are completing, assessments of seepages or groundwater infiltration at various facilities and have completed, or are working with agencies to implement, further testing, monitoring or abatement measures, where applicable. depending on the circumstances in each case, certain costs, which may be subject to rate recovery, could be significant. 18 table of contents superfund and other remediation (all registrants) from time to time, ppl's subsidiaries in the united states undertake testing, monitoring or remedial action in response to spills or other releases at various on-site and off-site locations, negotiate with the epa and state and local agencies regarding actions necessary to comply with applicable requirements, negotiate with property owners and other third parties alleging impacts from ppl's operations and undertake similar actions necessary to resolve environmental matters that arise in the course of normal operations. based on analyses to date, resolution of these environmental matters is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the operations of ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku. future cleanup or remediation work at sites not yet identified may result in significant additional costs for ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku. insurance policies maintained by lke, lg&amp;e and ku may be available to cover certain of the costs or other obligations related to these matters, but the amount of insurance coverage or reimbursement cannot be estimated or assured. see legal matters in note 13 to the financial statements for additional information. (all registrants) seasonality the demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. as a result, the registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when unpredictable weather conditions make such fluctuations more pronounced. the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned. see "item 1. business - environmental matters - air" for additional information regarding climate change. financial condition see "financial condition" in "item 7.

from environmental matters. employee relations at december 31, 2019 , ppl and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees and employees represented by labor unions: total full-time employees number of union employees percentage of total workforce ppl 12,280 5,787 47 % ppl electric 1,562 918 59 % lke 3,480 786 23 % lg&amp;e 1,039 668 64 % ku 890 118 13 % ppl's domestic workforce has 1,862 employees, or 33%, that are members of labor unions. wpd has 3,925 employees who are members of labor unions (or 60% of ppl's u.k. workforce). wpd recognizes four unions, the largest of which represent 41% of its union workforce. wpd's electricity business agreement, which covers 3,868 union employees, may be amended by agreement between wpd and the unions and can be terminated with 12 months' notice by either side. 19 table of contents cybersecurity management the registrants and their subsidiaries are subject to risks from cyber-attacks that have the potential to cause significant interruptions to the operation of their businesses. the frequency of these attempted intrusions has increased in recent years and the sources, motivations and techniques of attack continue to evolve and change rapidly. ppl has adopted a variety of measures to monitor and address cyber-related risks. cybersecurity and the effectiveness of ppl's cybersecurity strategy are regular topics of discussion at board meetings. ppl's strategy for managing cyber-related risks is risk-based and, where appropriate, integrated within ppl's enterprise risk management processes. ppl's chief information security officer (ciso), who reports directly to the chief executive officer, leads a dedicated cybersecurity team and is responsible for the design, implementation, and execution of cyber-risk management strategy. among other things, the ciso and the cybersecurity team actively monitor the registrants' systems, regularly review policies, compliance, regulations and best practices, perform penetration testing, lead response exercises and internal campaigns, and provide training and communication across the organization to strengthen secure behavior. the cybersecurity team also routinely participates in industry-wide programs to further information sharing, intelligence gathering, and unity of effort in responding to potential or actual attacks. in addition, in 2018, ppl revised and formalized its internal policy and procedures for communicating cybersecurity incidents on an enterprise-wide basis. in addition to these enterprise-wide initiatives, ppl's kentucky and pennsylvania operations are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cybersecurity requirements that are developed and enforced by nerc and approved by ferc to protect grid security and reliability. finally, ppl purchases insurance to protect against a wide range of costs that could be incurred in connection with cyber-related incidents. there can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be effective to prevent interruption of services or other damage to the registrants' businesses or operations or that ppl's insurance coverage will cover all costs incurred in connection with any cyber-related incident. available information ppl's internet website is www.pplweb.com. under the investors heading of that website, ppl provides access to sec filings of the registrants (including annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(d) or 15(d)) free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec. additionally, the registrants' filings are available at the sec's website (www.sec.gov). 20 table of contents item 1a. risk factors the registrants face various risks associated with their businesses. our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. in addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 13 to the financial statements for more information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. as used in this item 1a., the terms "we," "our" and "us" generally refer to ppl and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or ppl electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the pennsylvania regulated segment discussion, or lke and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the kentucky regulated segment discussion. order of subsection presentation a. risks related to our u.k. regulated segment b. risks related to registrant holding companies c. risks related to domestic regulated utility operations d. risks specific to kentucky regulated segment e. risks specific to pennsylvania regulated segment f. risks related to all segments (ppl) a. risks related to our u.k. regulated segment our u.k. distribution business contributes a significant amount of ppl's earnings and exposes us to the following additional risks related to operating outside the u.s., including risks associated with changes in u.k. laws and regulations, taxes, economic conditions and political conditions and policies of the u.k. government and the european union. these risks may adversely impact the results of operations of our u.k. distribution business or affect our ability to access u.k. revenues for payment of distributions or for other corporate purposes in the u.s. changes in laws or regulations relating to u.k. operations, including rate regulations beginning in april 2023 under riio-ed2, operational performance and tax laws and regulations; changes in government policies, personnel or approval requirements; changes in general economic conditions affecting the u.k.; regulatory reviews of tariffs for dnos; changes in labor relations; limitations on foreign investment or ownership of projects and returns or distributions to foreign investors; limitations on the ability of foreign companies to borrow money from foreign lenders and lack of local capital or loans; changes in u.s. tax law applicable to taxation of foreign earnings; compliance with u.s. foreign corrupt practices laws; and prolonged periods of low inflation or deflation. ppl's earnings may be adversely affected by the u.k. withdrawal from the european union. in 2019, approximately 56% of ppl's net income was generated from its u.k. businesses. significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the financial, foreign currency exchange rate and other consequences of the u.k. withdrawal from the european union, including the outcome of negotiations between the u.k. and european union as to the terms to be negotiated by december 31, 2020 concerning trade, security and certain other matters. ppl cannot predict the impact on ppl's u.k. operations that may be experienced as a result of these negotiations, although such impacts could be material. we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks because a significant portion of our cash flows and reported earnings are currently generated by our u.k. business operations. these risks relate primarily to changes in the relative value of the british pound sterling and the u.s. dollar between the time we initially invest u.s. dollars in our u.k. businesses, and our strategy to hedge against such changes, and the time that cash is repatriated to the u.s. from the u.k., including cash flows from our u.k. businesses that may be distributed to ppl or used for repayments of intercompany loans or other general corporate purposes. in addition, ppl's consolidated reported earnings on a 21 table of contents gaap basis may be subject to earnings translation risk, which results from the conversion of earnings as reported in our u.k. businesses on a british pound sterling basis to a u.s. dollar basis in accordance with gaap requirements. our u.k. segment's earnings are subject to variability based on fluctuations in rpi, which is a measure of inflation. in riio-ed1, wpd's base revenue was established by ofgem based on 2012/13 prices. base revenue is subsequently adjusted to reflect any increase or decrease in rpi for each year to determine the amount of revenue wpd can collect in tariffs. the rpi is forecasted annually by hm treasury and subject to true-up in subsequent years. consequently, fluctuations between forecasted and actual rpi can result in variances in base revenue. although wpd also has debt indexed to rpi and certain components of operations and maintenance expense are affected by inflation, these may not offset changes in base revenue and timing of such offsets would likely not be correlated precisely with the calendar year in which the variance in demand revenue was initially incurred. further, as rav is indexed to rpi under u.k. rate regulations, a reduction in rpi could adversely affect a borrower's debt-to-rav ratio, potentially limiting future borrowings at wpd's holding company. our u.k. delivery business is subject to revenue variability based on operational performance. our u.k. delivery businesses operate under an incentive-based regulatory framework. managing operational risk and delivering agreed-upon performance are critical to the u.k. regulated segment's financial performance. disruption to these distribution networks could reduce profitability both directly by incurring costs for network restoration and also through the system of penalties and rewards that ofgem administers relating to customer service levels. our ability to collect current levels of pension deficit funding for certain wpd pension plans after march 2021 is uncertain. wpd recovers approximately 80% of pension deficit funding for certain of wpd's defined benefit pension plans in conjunction with actual costs under the riio-ed1 price control. the pension deficit is determined by the pension trustees on a triennial basis in accordance with their funding requirements. pension deficit funding recovered in revenues was 151 million, 147 million and 142 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017. wpd expects similar amounts to be collected in revenues through march 31, 2021, but cannot predict amounts that will be collected in revenues beyond then as the plans are approaching a fully funded status. the current triennial pension review commenced in march 2019 and is expected to conclude by the end of 2020. a failure by any of our u.k. regulated businesses to comply with the terms of a distribution license may lead to the issuance of an enforcement order by ofgem that could have an adverse impact on ppl. ofgem has powers to levy fines of up to ten percent of revenue for any breach of a distribution license or, in certain circumstances, such as insolvency, the distribution license itself may be revoked. ofgem also has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license and there can be no assurance that a restrictive modification will not be introduced in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the u.k. regulated businesses and ppl. (ppl and lke) b. risk related to registrant holding companies ppl and lke are holding companies and their cash flows and ability to meet their obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and ppl's ability to pay dividends, largely depends on the financial performance of their respective subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries. ppl and lke are holding companies and conduct their operations primarily through subsidiaries. substantially all of the consolidated assets of these registrants are held by their subsidiaries. accordingly, these registrants' cash flows and ability to meet debt and guaranty obligations, as well as ppl's ability to pay dividends, are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends, distributions, loans, advances or repayment of loans and advances. the subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends or distributions to their parents or to make funds available for such a payment. the ability of the registrants' subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions in the future will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory requirements, including restrictions on the ability of ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku to pay dividends under section 305(a) of the federal power act. 22 table of contents because ppl and lke are holding companies, their debt and guaranty obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of their subsidiaries. although certain agreements to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, ppl and lke and their subsidiaries retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities. therefore, ppl's and lke's rights and the rights of their creditors, including rights of debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of their subsidiaries, in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors. (ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku) c. risks related to domestic regulated utility operations our domestic regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to each of the kentucky regulated and pennsylvania regulated segments. set forth below are risk factors common to both domestic regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments. our profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments. regulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged. the rates we charge our utility customers must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the ferc, kpsc, vscc and puc. although rate regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full or timely recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments. federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our current or future rate requests, structures or mechanisms, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we receive. although our rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year or on future projected costs, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. our domestic regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which will likely require rate increase requests to the regulators. if our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our domestic utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation. in addition to regulating the rates we charge, various federal and state regulatory authorities regulate many aspects of our domestic utility operations, including: the terms and conditions of our service and operations; financial and capital structure matters; siting, construction and operation of facilities; mandatory reliability and safety standards under the energy policy act of 2005 and other standards of conduct; accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies; tax matters; affiliate transactions; acquisition and disposal of utility assets and issuance of securities; and various other matters, including energy efficiency. such regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties which may not be recoverable from customers. our domestic regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs. the domestic regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of lg&amp;e and ku) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. the completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including: approval, licensing and permitting; land acquisition and the availability of suitable land; 23 table of contents skilled labor or equipment shortages; construction problems or delays, including disputes with third-party intervenors; increases in commodity prices or labor rates; and contractor performance. failure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators. we are or may be subject to costs of remediation of environmental contamination at facilities owned or operated by our former subsidiaries. we may be subject to liability for the costs of environmental remediation of property now or formerly owned by us with respect to substances that we may have generated regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during or after the time we owned or operated the facilities. we also have current or previous ownership interests in sites associated with the production of manufactured gas for which we may be liable for additional costs related to investigation, remediation and monitoring of these sites. remediation activities associated with our former manufactured gas plant operations are one source of such costs. citizen groups or others may bring litigation regarding environmental issues including claims of various types, such as property damage, personal injury and citizen challenges to compliance decisions on the enforcement of environmental requirements, which could subject us to penalties, injunctive relief and the cost of litigation. we cannot predict the amount and timing of all future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties) related to such environmental matters, although they could be material. d. risks specific to kentucky regulated segment ( ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku ) we are subject to financial, operational, regulatory and other risks related to requirements, developments and uncertainties in environmental regulation, including those affecting coal-fired generation facilities. extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to lg&amp;e's and ku's generation supply, including its air emissions, water discharges (elgs) and the management of hazardous and solid wastes (ccrs), among other business-related activities, and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted but could be material. in addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed as the environmental standards governing lg&amp;e's and ku's businesses, particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to rulemaking and other regulatory developments, legislative activities and litigation, administrative or permit challenges. depending on the extent, frequency and timing of such changes, the companies may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, delayed or incomplete rate recovery or increased costs of implementation. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures, operational changes, permit limitations or other restrictions. at some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. market prices for energy and capacity also affect this cost-effectiveness analysis. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers or customers, such as coal producers, power producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products and demand for our services. ( ppl, lke and lg&amp;e ) we are subject to operational, regulatory and other risks regarding natural gas supply infrastructure. a natural gas pipeline explosion or associated incident could have a significant impact on lg&amp;e's natural gas operations or result in significant damages and penalties that could have an adverse impact on lg&amp;e's financial position and results of operations. the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration enforces regulations that govern the design, construction, operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities. failure to comply with these regulations could result in the assessment of fines or penalties against lg&amp;e. these regulations require, among other things, that pipeline operators engage in a pipeline integrity program. depending on the results of these integrity tests and other integrity program activities, we could incur significant and unexpected costs to perform remedial activities on our natural gas infrastructure to ensure our continued safe and reliable operation. recent pipeline incidents in the u.s. have also led to the introduction of proposed rules and possible federal legislative actions which could impose restrictions on lg&amp;e's operations or require more stringent testing to 24 table of contents ensure pipeline integrity. implementation of these regulations could increase our costs to comply with pipeline integrity and safety regulations. e. risks specific to pennsylvania regulated segment ( ppl and ppl electric ) we face competition for transmission projects, which could adversely affect our rate base growth. ferc order 1000, issued in july 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electricity transmission planning activities. the ppl electric transmission business, operating under a ferc-approved pjm open access transmission tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to ferc order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent pjm transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within pjm. increased competition can result in lower rate base growth. we could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to pennsylvania conservation and energy efficiency programs. ppl electric is subject to act 129, which contains requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposes plr electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing alternative energy portfolio standard. the law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. utilities not meeting these act 129 requirements are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. f. risks related to all segments ( all registrants ) the operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based security and data integrity risks. numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. the operation of our transmission and distribution systems, as well as our generation plants, are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that these systems could be the target of disruptive actions by terrorists or criminals or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. as a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to our reputation. in addition, under the energy policy act of 2005, users, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system, including ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by nerc and enforced by ferc. as an operator of natural gas distribution systems, lg&amp;e is also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the u.s. department of transportation. failure to comply with these standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of the standards. we are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations. changes in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. we are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, property, gross receipts, franchise, sales and use, employment-related and other taxes. we also estimate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and tax credits. dependent upon the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered. we cannot predict changes in tax law or regulation or the effect of any such changes on our businesses. any such changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we have completed or made reasonable estimates of the effects of the tcja reflected in our december 31, 2018 financial statements, and we continue to evaluate the application of the law in calculating income tax expense. increases in electricity prices and/or a weak economy, can lead to changes in legislative and regulatory policy, including the promotion of energy efficiency, conservation and distributed generation or self-generation, which may adversely impact our business. 25 table of contents energy consumption is significantly impacted by overall levels of economic activity and costs of energy supplies. economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs can lead to changes in or the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency, alternative and renewable energy sources, and distributed or self-generation by customers. this focus on conservation, energy efficiency and self-generation may result in a decline in electricity demand, which could adversely affect our business. we could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our credit ratings, adverse credit market conditions or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets. our businesses are capital-intensive and, in the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt service and operating needs. as a result, we are sensitive to developments in interest rates, credit rating considerations, insurance, security or collateral requirements, market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased availability of credit. in addition, certain sources of debt and equity capital have expressed reservations about investing in companies that rely on fossil fuels. if sources of our capital are reduced, capital costs could increase materially. a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. credit ratings assigned by moody's and s&amp;p to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. a ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund liquidity needs and access new long-term debt at acceptable interest rates. see "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - ratings triggers" for additional information on the financial impact of a downgrade in our credit ratings. our operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of extreme weather conditions. our businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. for example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. as a result, our overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions diverge adversely from seasonal norms. operating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters. weather and other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs. storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues and increase expenses, due to reduced usage and restoration costs. our businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change. climate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electricity. in addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs to prepare for or respond to these effects. these or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electricity, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies. reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered by consumers' preferences or market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage. we cannot predict the outcome of legal proceedings or investigations related to our businesses in which we are periodically involved. an unfavorable outcome or determination in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and periodically are subject to state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in item 1. business and "regulatory 26 table of contents matters" in note 7 to the financial statements and in "legal matters" and "regulatory issues" in note 13 to the financial statements. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. significant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. we continually focus on limiting and reducing our operation and maintenance expenses. however, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. in addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. these benefits give rise to significant expenses. due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other factors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. the measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. these assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, inflation rates, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. we may incur liabilities in connection with discontinued operations. in connection with various divestitures, and certain other transactions, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities. these indemnities and guarantees relate, among other things, to liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated a divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with the divestiture. see "guarantees and other assurances" in note 13 to the financial statements. we are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution operations. the conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties. our facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses and decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial performance. operation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. these events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently and lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance costs, which may not be recoverable from customers. planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. although we maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks, we do not carry insurance for all of these risks and no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us in the event losses occur. 27 table of contents we are required to obtain, and to comply with, government permits and approvals. we are required to obtain, and to comply with, numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from governmental agencies. the process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex and sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which a permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. in addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals, or failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, may result in delay or temporary suspension of our operations and electricity sales or the curtailment of our power delivery and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions. although various regulators routinely renew existing licenses, renewal could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including failure to provide adequate financial assurance for closure; failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permit conditions; local community, political or other opposition; and executive, legislative or regulatory action. our cost or inability to obtain and comply with the permits and approvals required for our operations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows. in addition, new environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed interpretations of existing laws may elicit claims that historical routine modification activities at our facilities violated applicable laws and regulations. in addition to the possible imposition of fines in such cases, we may be required to undertake significant capital investments in pollution control technology and obtain additional operating permits or approvals, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. war, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business. war, terrorist attacks and unrest have caused and may continue to cause instability in the world's financial and commercial markets and have contributed to high levels of volatility in prices for oil and gas. in addition, unrest in the middle east could lead to acts of terrorism in the united states, the united kingdom or elsewhere, and acts of terrorism could be directed against companies such as ours. armed conflicts and terrorism and their effects on us or our markets may significantly affect our business and results of operations in the future. in addition, we may incur increased costs for security, including additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident. we are subject to counterparty performance, credit or other risk in the provision of goods or services to us, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities or conduct business activities. we purchase from a variety of suppliers energy, capacity, fuel, natural gas, transmission service and certain commodities used in the physical operation of our businesses, as well as goods or services, including information technology rights and services, used in the administration of our businesses. delivery of these goods and services is dependent on the continuing operational performance and financial viability of our contractual counterparties and also the markets, infrastructure or third parties they use to provide such goods and services to us. as a result, we are subject to risks of disruptions, curtailments or increased costs in the operation of our businesses if such goods or services are unavailable or become subject to price spikes or if a counterparty fails to perform. such disruptions could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities or deliver services and collect revenues, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. the performance of coal markets and producers may be the subject of increased counterparty risk to lke, lg&amp;e and ku currently due to weaknesses in such markets and suppliers. the coal industry is subject to increasing competitive pressures from natural gas markets, political pressures and new or more stringent environmental regulation, including regulation of combustion byproducts and water inputs or discharges. we are subject to the risk that our workforce and its knowledge base may become depleted in coming years. we are experiencing an increase in attrition due primarily to the number of retiring employees, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed personnel, and to attract and retain new personnel, with appropriate skills and experience, due to an increase in competition for such workers. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppl corporation, ppl electric utilities corporation, lg&amp;e and ku energy llc, louisville gas and electric company and kentucky utilities company reference is made to "risk management" for the registrants in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." 76 table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareowners and the board of directors of ppl corporation opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ppl corporation and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). in our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 14, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting. basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. regulatory assets and liabilities - impact of rate regulation on various account balances and disclosures - refer to notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements critical audit matter description as discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, ppl corporation owns and operates three cost-based rate-regulated utilities in the united states (u.s.) for which rates are set by the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc), the kentucky public service commission (kpsc), the virginia state corporation commission (vscc) and the pennsylvania public utility commission (puc) to enable the regulated utilities to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. base rates are generally established based on a future test period. as a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. the effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. 77 table of contents the accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the ferc, kpsc, vscc and puc. the accounting for the economics of rate regulation also impacts other financial statement line items, including regulated utility plant, operating revenues, depreciation, and income taxes and impacts multiple note disclosures. as of december 31, 2019, ppl corporation had a recorded regulatory assets balance of $1,559 million and regulatory liabilities balance of $2,687 million. ppl corporation's u.s. regulated utilities' rates are subject to cost-based rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. rates are established based on an analysis of the costs incurred and the regulated utility's capital structure, and must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the ferc, kpsc, vscc and puc. regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. the ferc, kpsc, vscc and puc regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and an adequate return on capital investments. decisions to be made by the ferc, kpsc, vscc and puc in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. while ppl corporation's u.s. utilities have indicated that they expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the ferc, kpsc, vscc or puc will not approve full recovery of such costs or approve recovery on a timely basis in future regulatory decisions. we identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in continually assessing whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors, such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders and the status of any pending legislation. auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate-setting process due to its inherent complexities. how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the ferc, kpsc, vscc and puc included the following, among others: we tested the effectiveness of management's internal controls over evaluating the likelihood of recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets. we tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the recognition of amounts as regulated utility plant, regulatory assets or liabilities, operating revenues, depreciation, income taxes, and note disclosures and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. we obtained and read relevant regulatory orders issued by the ferc, kpsc, vscc and puc for ppl corporation's u.s. regulated utilities to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. we inquired of management about regulated utility plant that may be abandoned. we inspected minutes of the board of directors, regulatory orders and other filings with the commission to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment. we evaluated ppl corporation's disclosures related to the impacts of rate-regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments, in the financial statements. goodwill - u.k. regulated reporting unit - refer to notes 1 and 18 to the financial statements critical audit matter description ppl corporation's balance sheet includes $3.2 billion of goodwill as of december 31, 2019, of which $2.5 billion was allocated to the u.k. regulated reporting unit. the fair value of the u.k. regulated reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized. ppl corporation elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test of goodwill for the u.k. regulated reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2019. management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows included discount and growth rates, and projected operating and capital cash flows. projected operating and capital cash flows are based on ppl corporation's internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future. significant assumptions used in the market multiples include utility sector market performance and comparable transactions. 78 table of contents we identified goodwill for the u.k. regulated reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the u.k. regulated reporting unit, specifically due to changes in the economy in the u.k. this required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to the regulatory asset value premiums (rav premiums), discount and growth rates, and projected operating and capital cash flows. how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to the rav premiums, discount and growth rates, and projected operating and capital cash flows used by management to estimate the fair value of the u.k. regulated reporting unit included the following, among others: we tested the effectiveness of management's internal controls over their goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the u.k. regulated reporting unit, such as controls related to management's rav premiums estimate, and selection of discount and growth rates and projected operating and capital cash flows. we evaluated the reasonableness of management's projected operating and capital cash flows by comparing the forecasts to: historical operating and capital cash flows. internal communications to management and the board of directors. forecasted information included in ppl corporation's press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports for ppl corporation. we evaluated the impact of changes in management's forecasts from the october 1, 2019 annual measurement date to december 31, 2019. with the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology, (2) rav premiums and (3) discount and growth rates by: testing the source information underlying the determination of the rav premiums, and discount and growth rates and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the rav premiums, and discount and growth rates selected by management. income taxes - valuation allowances - estimates of future taxable income and management's determination of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized - refer to note 1 and 6 to the financial statements critical audit matter description deferred income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. net deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's estimates of future taxable income for the u.s. and the u.k. ppl corporation files tax returns in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax laws and regulations. valuation allowances have been established for the amount that, more likely than not, will not be realized. ppl corporation has $834 million of valuation allowances recorded on $1,479 million of deferred tax assets related to federal, state and foreign loss and credit carryforwards as of december 31, 2019. management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset associated with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances. the amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. 79 table of contents we identified management's estimation of the valuation allowances associated with loss and credit carryforwards as a critical audit matter because the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. this required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates of future taxable income and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to estimated future taxable income and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized included the following, among others: we tested the effectiveness of management's internal controls over the valuation allowance for income taxes, including management's internal controls over the estimates of future taxable income and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods, assumptions, and judgments used by management to determine whether a valuation allowance was necessary. with the assistance of our income tax specialists, we evaluated whether the sources of management's estimated taxable income were of the appropriate character and sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets under the relevant tax laws. we evaluated management's ability to accurately estimate taxable income by comparing actual results to management's historical estimates and evaluating whether there have been any changes that would affect management's ability to continue accurately estimating taxable income. we tested the reasonableness of management's estimates of future taxable income by comparing the estimates to: internal budgets. historical taxable income, as adjusted for nonrecurring items. internal communications to management and the board of directors. forecasted information included in ppl corporation's press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports for ppl corporation. /s/ deloitte &amp; touche llp parsippany, new jersey february 14, 2020 we have served as the company's auditor since 2015. 80 table of

financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ deloitte &amp; touche llp parsippany, new jersey february 14, 2020 81 table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to
