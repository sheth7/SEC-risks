risk factors the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. many of our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to enhance efficiencies, reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, changes in the basis for payments, shifting away from fee-for-service and towards value-based payments and risk-sharing models, increases in the use of managed care, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future. 11 table of contents mckesson corporation changes in the healthcare industry's or our pharmaceutical suppliers' pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services. the majority of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide. however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. certain distribution business agreements we entered into with manufacturers continue to have pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation. consequently, our results of operations could be adversely affected if the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price increases declines, which we do not control. in addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation. during 2016, our distribution solutions segment experienced weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends, which are expected to continue in 2017. continued volatility in the availability, pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs, or significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. additionally, any future changes in branded and generics drug pricing could be significantly different than our projections. generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. during the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product's patent. to the extent we source, contract manufacture, and distribute such generic products, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us. while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations. healthcare fraud: we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse. local, state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid. many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. the regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. 12 table of contents mckesson corporation reimbursements: both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. for example, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act (collectively the affordable care act ), signed into law in 2010, revised, subject to rulemaking, the federal upper limits ( ful ) for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis. on january 21, 2016, the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) released the covered outpatient drugs final rule with comment. the final rule, with limited exceptions, establishes the ful to be 175% of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price ( amp ) using a smoothing process. states had until may 2016 to implement the fuls. additionally, the final rule established actual acquisition cost as the basis by which states should determine their ingredient cost reimbursement, addressed the sufficiency of dispensing fees to reflect the cost of the pharmacist's professional services and cost to dispense drugs to medicaid beneficiaries, and clarified that states are required to evaluate the sufficiency of both ingredient cost and professional dispensing fee when proposing changes to either component. use of the revised amp-based ful may result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals, which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability. the federal government may adopt measures that could reduce medicare and/or medicaid spending, or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities. for example, under the terms of the budget control act of 2011, an automatic 2% reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after april 1, 2013. this automatic reduction is known as sequestration. medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of average sales price ( asp ) plus 6%. the implementation of sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6% level for the duration of sequestration (which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation). as another example, the medicare access and chip reauthorization act ( macra ), signed into law in april 2015, seeks to reform medicare reimbursement policy for physician fee schedule services and adopts a series of policy changes affecting a wide range of providers and suppliers. most notably, macra repeals the statutory sustainable growth rate formula, which has called for cuts in medicare rates in recent years, but which congress routinely stepped in to override the full application of the formula. instead, after a period of stable payment updates, macra links physician payment updates to quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models. macra also extends certain expiring medicare and other health policy provisions, including extending the children's health insurance program. additionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program, or both. we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions, if any, will ultimately be enacted into law, or the timing or affect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us. there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. operating, security and licensure standards: we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration ( dea ), the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ), the cms and other comparable agencies. certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the dea, fda, hhs, cms, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. for example, we are required to hold valid dea and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, distribution, and disposal of controlled substances. as part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. in some instances, these can lead to monetary penalties and/or license revocation. in march 2015, we reached an agreement in principle with the dea and department of justice pursuant to which we agreed to pay the sum of $150 million to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company's suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances. although we have enhanced our procedures to ensure compliance, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 13 table of contents mckesson corporation pedigree tracking: there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, otherwise known as pedigree tracking. in november 2013, congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act ( dqsa ). the dqsa establishes federal standards requiring supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable, lot-level prescription drug track and trace system. the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements. the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers, including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities. in addition, the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007, which went into effect on october 1, 2007, requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies. on march 26, 2010, the fda released the serialized numerical identifier ( sni ) guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging. we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations. the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. privacy: state, federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of personal information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released. these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures. regulations currently in place, including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. although we modified our policies, procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal and foreign laws, including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and the health information technology for economic and clinical health ( hitech ) act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, new laws and regulations in this area could further restrict our or our customers' ability to obtain, use or disseminate personal or patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products or services in a timely manner, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations. it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customer. these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations. furthermore, our failure to maintain the confidentiality of personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims, tort damages, fines and penalties, costs for remediation, media attention and harm to our customer relationships and reputation. healthcare reform : the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement and/or finalize (e.g. nondiscrimination in health programs and activities, excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage). we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. however, given the scope of the changes made and under consideration, as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms, we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time. 14 table of contents mckesson corporation interoperability and meaningful use requirement: there is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare information technology products provided by various vendors be compatible with each other. in 2013, in order to address this demand for interoperability we and a number of other healthcare information technology ( it ) companies co-founded the commonwell health alliance with the aim of developing a standard for data sharing among doctors, hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. certain federal and state agencies also are developing standards that could become mandatory for software and systems purchased by these agencies, or used by our customers. with respect to legislation addressing interoperability, macra promotes and defines interoperability, requires metrics to measure interoperability, and requires vendors and providers to attest that they are not blocking data. regarding meaningful use requirements, the hitech act requires meaningful use of certified healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government. further, the 21st century cures bill that passed the u.s. house of representatives last year contained language focused on promoting greater interoperability of health it. specifically the bill creates penalties for so-called information blocking by it vendors or providers. the bill also carves most health it products out of the fda's jurisdiction, but includes a clawback provision that would enable fda to regulate products on a case-by-case basis if it determined they pose a risk to patient safety. finally, the bill included additional funding for the national institutes of health, and the fda. the senate is currently considering similar legislation with final passage possible this year. although several of our healthcare information technology products have received certification, rules regarding meaningful use may be changed or supplemented in the future. as a result of interoperability and meaningful requirements, we may incur increased development costs and delays in receiving certification for our products, and changing or supplementing rules also may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle. we also may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. to the extent these requirements subsequently are changed or supplemented, or we are delayed in receiving certification for our products, customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement these products. fda regulation of medical software: the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the federal food, drug and cosmetic act. for example, in 2011 the fda issued a rule on medical device data systems that regulates certain software that electronically stores, transfers or displays data originating from medical devices as class 1 medical devices themselves (i.e., those devices deemed by the fda to be low risk and subject to the least regulatory controls). however, in february 2015, the fda issued guidance to inform manufacturers and distributors of medical device data systems that it did not intend to enforce compliance with regulatory controls that apply to medical device data systems, medical image storage devices, and medical image communication devices. if the fda chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices, or subsequently changes or reverses its guidance regarding not enforcing regulatory controls for certain medical device products, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the fda could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. any additional fda regulations governing health information technology products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products. the 21st century cures bill would also change the way health it would be regulated by the fda. the bill also carves most health it products out of the fda's jurisdiction, but includes a clawback provision that would enable fda to regulate products on a case-by-case basis if it determined they pose a risk to patient safety. the senate is currently considering similar legislation with final passage probable this year. standards for submission of healthcare claims : hhs previously adopted two rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement. the first rule modified the standards for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from version 4010/4010a to version 5010. the second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases, ninth revision ( icd-9 ) to international classification of diseases, tenth revision ( icd-10 ). the compliance date for icd-10 conversion was postponed from october 1, 2014 to october 1, 2015. updating systems to version 5010 for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) is required for use of the icd-10 code set. generally, claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd-10 will not be processed, and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd-10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries. we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems as the healthcare industry moves towards compliance with these rules. in addition, these rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with these rules may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers' decisions to purchase our software and systems. 15 table of contents mckesson corporation medical billing and coding: medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws. in connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare, medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we have operations based in, and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products in, a number of foreign countries. the company's acquisition of celesio ag ( celesio ) significantly increases the importance of our foreign operations to our future operations and growth. our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks including changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies; unexpected regulatory, social, political, or economic changes in a specific country or region; changes in intellectual property, privacy and data protection; import/export regulations and trade sanctions in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. political changes, labor strikes, acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad. foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. the u.k. bribery act, for example, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the u.k. bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to: (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities; (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand; (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, physical limitations, or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply; and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. for example, the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the u.s. from overseas plants due to quality issues. difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs. provincial governments in canada have introduced significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. for instance, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, provincial governments have taken steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs. these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, changes to the allowable amounts of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers. these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company's operations in canada. other provinces have implemented or are considering similar changes, which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. individually or in combination, such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit. 16 table of contents mckesson corporation general european economic conditions, together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the company's acquisition of celesio increased our assets and operations within europe and, accordingly, our exposure to economic conditions in europe. a slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services. a slowdown may also reduce the demand for our products. either of these could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. in recent years, in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe, a number of european governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures. these measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay. countries with existing healthcare-related austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. in addition, european governments that have not yet imposed healthcare-related austerity measures may impose them in the future. new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in europe, we are subject to the 1995 european union ( eu ) directive on data protection ( 1995 data protection directive ), which requires eu member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. the eu member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. in addition, certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards. the company had addressed these requirements by certification to the u.s.-eu safe harbor frameworks prior to such frameworks being invalidated in october 2015 by the european court of justice. although recent negotiations between the u.s. and the eu have yielded the likely successor to the safe harbor framework, the eu-u.s. privacy shield, this new framework has not yet been approved by all of the necessary eu regulatory bodies. in the interim, we are pursuing alternative methods of compliance, but those methods may be subject to scrutiny by data protection authorities in eu member states. on december 15, 2015, the european parliament and the council of the european union (council) reached a political agreement on the future eu data protection legal framework. subject to formal adoption by the european parliament in the first half of 2016, the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) will replace the 1995 data protection directive. although the gdpr has not yet been finalized and minor modifications remain possible, the gdpr will have significant impacts on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of eu individuals. the gdpr is expected to become effective sometime in 2018, two years after its final adoption in 2016. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our results of operations, which are stated in u.s. dollars, could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we conduct our business worldwide in u.s. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including euro, british pound sterling and canadian dollar. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks. additionally, we may use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency exchange rate risks. these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place. 17 table of contents mckesson corporation our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully. an element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; and challenges retaining the customers of the combined businesses. further, acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed litigation and unknown liabilities. in addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets. if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. on february 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of celesio and certain convertible bonds of celesio. upon the acquisition, our ownership of celesio's fully diluted shares was 75.6%. celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. on december 2, 2014, we obtained the ability to pursue the integration of the two companies upon the effectiveness of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the domination agreement ). achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of celesio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including foreign exchange fluctuations, challenges of managing new international operations, and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of celesio's products and services. the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized or, if realized, the timing of its realization. it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated, and could result in the loss of employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements. any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. any significant diversion of management's attention away from the ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition, transition and integration process, could adversely affect our financial results. moreover, the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and could adversely affect our future business, financial position and operating results. events outside of our control, including the market price of celesio shares that we did not acquire in the acquisition, changes in regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from our acquisition of celesio. our business and results of operations could be impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures. we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives. for example, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business and a small business from our distribution solutions segment, as well as a small business from our technology solutions segment. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. we may also experience greater dissynergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. after reaching an agreement with a buyer, we are subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the sale. dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 18 table of contents mckesson corporation we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. from time to time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings involving false claims, healthcare fraud and abuse, antitrust, class actions, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, licensing, tort and other various claims. all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments. in some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. for some complaints filed against the company, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company. the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management's time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation. competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit. our distribution solutions segment faces a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. in addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. in all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation and, in some cases, convenience to the customer. in addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. as a result, a small number of very large pharmaceutical suppliers could control a significant share of the market. accordingly, we could depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers. many of our customers, including healthcare organizations that purchase our products and services, have also consolidated to create larger enterprises with greater market power. if this consolidation trend continues among our customers, suppliers and competitors, it could reduce the number of market participants and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services. it would also increase counter-party credit risk as the number of market participants decreases. in addition, when our customers combine, they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems, which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base. our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many companies, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. these competitive pressures and industry consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 19 table of contents mckesson corporation a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization, as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. in recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers. during 2016 , sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations ( gpos ) accounted for approximately 52.4% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our largest customer, cvs health ( cvs ), accounted for approximately 20.3% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2016 , trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 32% of total trade accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs were approximately 18% of total trade accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with gpos, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. a material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured. any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow. further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities. government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the u.s. false claims act, the procurement integrity act, the buy american act and the trade agreements act. we must also comply with various other domestic and foreign government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and oversight proceedings. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether contractors are complying with specific contractual or legal requirements. if we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement, or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by a government including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 20 table of contents mckesson corporation our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad. public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers. we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company's operating results. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we rely on sophisticated computer systems to perform our business operations. although we and our customers use a variety of security measures to protect our and their computer systems, a failure or compromise of our or our customers' computer systems from a cyberattack, natural disaster, or malfunction may result in material adverse operational and financial consequences. our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information, financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. we routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information, protected health information, financial information, and confidential information relating to our business or third parties. some of the data that we process, store and transmit may travel outside of the united states. additionally, we outsource some important it functions to external service providers worldwide. despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our and our customers' computer systems could be subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized access, such as physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. like other global companies, we and our customers have experienced threats to data and systems, including malware and ransomware attacks, unauthorized access, system failures, and disruptions. a failure or compromise of our or our customers' computer systems may jeopardize the confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information processed, stored, and transmitted through such computer systems. such an event may result in significant damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties, customer attrition, brand impairment, or other business harm. these risks may increase in the future as we continue to expand our internet and mobile strategies and to build an integrated digital enterprise. we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance. in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment's customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. one or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decision making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management's attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient. we also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. in addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 21 table of contents mckesson corporation the acquisition of celesio exposes us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services. pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. although we maintain liability insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims. if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations. our healthcare technology businesses, the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment, deliver enterprise wide and single entity clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain and strategic management software solutions to hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail and mail order pharmacies and payers. challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment. future advances in healthcare information technology could lead to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses. such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete. the success of our technology businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to be responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing business models. to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information technology marketplace, our technology businesses must also develop new products and services on a timely basis. the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products and services on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers, and thereby could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. proprietary protections may not be adequate, and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties. we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or services that are equivalent or superior to ours. in addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us, and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. if we were found to be infringing others' rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing products or services, obtain a license or cease selling or using the products or services that contain the infringing elements. additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. these litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. system errors or failures of our products or services to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the software and technology services that we sell or operate are complex. as with complex systems offered by others, our software and technology services may contain errors, especially when first introduced. for example, our technology solutions segment's systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care. therefore, users of our software and technology services have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. if clinicians' use of our software and technology services leads to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our customers, clinicians or patients. in addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales. failure of a customer's system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages. 22 table of contents mckesson corporation various risks could interrupt customers' access to their data residing in our service center, exposing us to significant costs. we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers. the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers. our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; and (4) cyber attacks, computer viruses, hacking and other similar disruptive problems. we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change controls, information security procedures, and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security, but our precautions may not protect against all risks. if customers' access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. if customers' access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our contractors or third party service providers, we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services. the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles, which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation. how and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer. any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. we are required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a divestiture, indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. there are inherent uncertainties in management's estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. 23 table of contents mckesson corporation tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. from time to time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation. for example, if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes, it would adversely impact our cash flow. additionally, if legislation is passed to change the current u.s. taxation treatment of income from foreign operations, or if legislation is passed at the state level to establish or increase taxation on the basis of our gross revenues, it may adversely impact our tax expense. the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. for example, we operate in various countries that collect value added taxes ( vat ). the determination of the manner in which a vat applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws and regulations. although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, as jurisdictions enact legislation to implement the recommendations of the recently concluded base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development or as a result of the european commission's investigations into illegal state aid, changes to long-standing tax principles may result which could adversely impact our tax expense. volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements. although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. additionally, if customers' or suppliers' operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms, may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements. our financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt, such as the amended guidance for revenue recognition, leases, and share based payments, may require changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our systems. such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. 24 table of contents mckesson corporation we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate, or if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities. we participate in various multiemployer pension plans. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make additional cash contributions to the plans in installments. our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. the multiemployer plans could have significant unfunded vested liabilities. such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. in addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and business process initiatives. on march 14, 2016, the company committed to a restructuring plan to lower its operating costs ( cost alignment plan ). the cost alignment plan primarily consists of a reduction in workforce and business process initiatives that will be substantially implemented prior to the end of 2019. expense reduction initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, our restructuring and business process initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results. we cannot guarantee that the activities under any restructuring and business initiative will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings. we may experience difficulties with outsourcing and similar third party relationships. our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted if we experience difficulties with outsourcing and managing similar third-party relationships. we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. if we fail to develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategies, such strategies prove to be ineffective or fail to provide expected cost savings, or our third party providers fail to perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties and increased costs may adversely affect the results of our operations. we may face risks associated with our retail expansion. in recent years, we have expanded our retail operations through a number of acquisitions. as we expand our retail footprint, we may face risks that are different from those we currently encounter. our expansion into additional retail markets, such as those in europe and canada, could result in increased competitive, merchandising and distribution challenges. we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers to our retail locations due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands and our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. our ability to expand successfully will depend on acceptance of our retail store experience by customers, including our ability to design our stores in a manner that resonates locally and to offer the correct product assortment to appeal to consumers. furthermore, our continued growth in the retail sector may strain relations with certain of our distribution customers who also compete in the retail pharmacy sector. there can be no assurance that our retail locations will be received as well as, or achieve net sales or profitability levels consistent with, our projected targets or be comparable to those of our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us, or at all. if our retail expansion fails to achieve, or unable to sustain, acceptable net sales and profitability levels, our business, results of operations and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected. our retail stores may require additional management time and attention. failure to properly supervise the operation and maintain the consistency of the customer experience in those retail stores could result in loss of customers and potentially adversely affect our results of operations. 25 table of contents mckesson corporation we may be unable to keep existing retail store locations or open new retail locations in desirable places, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. we may be unable to keep existing retail locations or open new retail locations in desirable places in the future. we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable retail locations. local land use, local zoning issues, environmental regulations and other regulations may affect our ability to find suitable retail locations and also influence the cost of leasing or buying them. we also may have difficulty negotiating real estate leases for new stores, renewing real estate leases for existing stores or negotiating purchase agreements for new sites on acceptable terms. in addition, construction, environmental, zoning and real estate delays may negatively affect retail location openings and increase costs and capital expenditures. if we are unable to keep up our existing retail store locations or open new retail store locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk: our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. at march 31, 2016, we had $35 million in outstanding debt with variable interest rates. our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. at march 31, 2016, we had $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2016 and 2015 of approximately $26 million and $19 million. foreign exchange risk: we conduct our business worldwide in u.s. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including euro, british pound sterling and canadian dollar. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in u.s. dollars. we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. we have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps. the forward contracts and cross currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk. as of march 31, 2016 and 2015, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $131 million and $223 million. however, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. refer to financial note 20, hedging activities, for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps. the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. 52 table of contents mckesson corporationrisk factors the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. many of our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to enhance efficiencies, reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, changes in the basis for payments, shifting away from fee-for-service and towards value-based payments and risk-sharing models, increases in the use of managed care, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future. changes in the healthcare industry's or our pharmaceutical suppliers' pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services. the majority of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide. however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. certain distribution business agreements we entered into with manufacturers continue to have pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation. consequently, our results of operations could be adversely affected if the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price increases or decreases, which we do not control. in addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation. during 2017, our distribution solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical pricing trends, which are expected to continue in 2018. continued volatility in the availability, pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs, or significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. additionally, any future changes in branded and generics drug pricing could be significantly different than our projections. 11 table of contents mckesson corporation generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. during the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product's patent. to the extent we source, contract manufacture, and distribute such generic products, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us. while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations. healthcare fraud: we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse. local, state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid. many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. the regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. reimbursements: both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. for example, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act (collectively the affordable care act ), signed into law in 2010, revised, subject to rulemaking, the federal upper limits ( ful ) for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis. on january 21, 2016, the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) released the covered outpatient drugs final rule with comment. the final rule, with limited exceptions, establishes the ful to be 175% of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price ( amp ). additionally, the final rule established actual acquisition cost as the basis by which states should determine their ingredient cost reimbursement, addressed the sufficiency of dispensing fees to reflect the cost of the pharmacist's professional services and cost to dispense drugs to medicaid beneficiaries, and clarified that states are required to evaluate the sufficiency of both ingredient cost and professional dispensing fee when proposing changes to either component. use of the revised amp-based ful may result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals, which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability. 12 table of contents mckesson corporation the federal government may adopt measures that could reduce medicare and/or medicaid spending, or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities. for example, under the terms of the budget control act of 2011, an automatic 2% reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after april 1, 2013. this automatic reduction is known as sequestration. medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of average sales price ( asp ) plus 6%. the implementation of sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6% level for the duration of sequestration (which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation). as another example, the medicare access and chip reauthorization act ( macra ), signed into law in april 2015, seeks to reform medicare reimbursement policy for physician fee schedule services and adopts a series of policy changes affecting a wide range of providers and suppliers. most notably, macra repeals the statutory sustainable growth rate formula, which has called for cuts in medicare rates in recent years, but which congress routinely stepped in to override the full application of the formula. instead, after a period of stable payment updates, macra links physician payment updates to quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models. macra also extends certain expiring medicare and other health policy provisions, including extending the children's health insurance program. additionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program, or both. we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions, if any, will ultimately be enacted into law, or the timing or affect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us. there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. operating, security and licensure standards: we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration ( dea ), the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ), the cms and other comparable agencies. certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the dea, fda, hhs, cms, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. for example, we are required to hold valid dea and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, distribution, and disposal of controlled substances. as part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. in some instances, these can lead to monetary penalties and/or license revocation. in january 2017, we reached an agreement with the dea and department of justice pursuant to which we paid the sum of $150 million to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company's suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances. the dea is suspending, on a staggered basis for limited periods of time, mckesson's dea registrations to distribute certain controlled substances from four mckesson distribution centers. although we have enhanced our procedures to ensure compliance, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. pedigree tracking: there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, otherwise known as pedigree tracking. in november 2013, congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act ( dqsa ). the dqsa establishes federal standards requiring supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable, lot-level prescription drug track and trace system. the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements. the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers, including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities. 13 table of contents mckesson corporation in addition, the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007, which went into effect on october 1, 2007, requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies. on march 26, 2010, the fda released the serialized numerical identifier ( sni ) guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging. we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations. the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. privacy: there are numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. in particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (known as protected health information ) and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. we are directly subject to certain provisions of the regulations as a business associate through our relationships with customers. we are also directly subject to the hipaa privacy and security regulations as a covered entity with respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse, specialty pharmacy and medical surgical supply business. the privacy regulations established under hipaa also provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their protected health information is used and disclosed. to the extent permitted by applicable privacy regulations and our contracts with our customers, we may use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, such as creating de-identified information. other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations. determining whether protected health information has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the hipaa privacy standards and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation. if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of protected health information entrusted to us, we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers. further, if we fail to comply with applicable hipaa privacy and security standards, we could face civil and criminal penalties. hhs performs compliance audits of covered entities and business associates and enforces the hipaa privacy and security standards. hhs has become an increasingly active regulator and has signaled its intention to continue this trend. hhs has the discretion to impose penalties without being required to attempt to resolve violations through informal means, such as implementing a corrective action plan. hhs enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm, and responses to such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources. in addition to enforcement by hhs, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. although we have implemented and maintain policies and processes to assist us in complying with these regulations and our contractual obligations, we cannot provide assurance regarding how these regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. in addition to the risks associated with enforcement activities and potential contractual liabilities, our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and state level might also require us to make costly system purchases and/or modifications from time to time. healthcare reform : the affordable care act ( aca ) significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. while certain provisions of the aca took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement and/or finalize (e.g. nondiscrimination in health programs and activities, excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage). further, as a result of the november 2016 u.s. presidential election, there are uncertainties associated with efforts to change or repeal the aca or other healthcare reforms, and we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time. two top legislative priorities of the new presidential administration and congress may be significant reform of the aca, as discussed above, and reform of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code ), including significant changes to taxation of business entities and the deductibility of interest expense. while there is currently a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood, timing and details of any such policies and reforms, such policies and reforms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 14 table of contents mckesson corporation fda regulation of medical software: the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the federal food, drug and cosmetic act. for example, in february 2015, the fda issued guidance to inform manufacturers and distributors of medical device data systems that it did not intend to enforce compliance with regulatory controls that apply to medical device data systems, medical image storage devices, and medical image communication devices. if the fda chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices, or subsequently changes or reverses its guidance regarding not enforcing regulatory controls for certain medical device products, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the fda could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. any additional fda regulations governing health information technology products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products. in december 2016, congress passed and the president signed into law the 21st century cures act. the 21st century cures act changes the way health it would be regulated by the fda. the bill also carves most health it products out of the fda's jurisdiction, but includes a clawback provision that would enable fda to regulate products on a case-by-case basis if it determined they pose a risk to patient safety. medical billing and coding: medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws. in connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare, medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we have operations based in, and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products in, a number of foreign countries. moreover, in europe, celesio operates as a wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector. our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks including changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies; unexpected regulatory, social, political, or economic changes in a specific country or region; changes in intellectual property, privacy and data protection; import/export regulations and trade sanctions in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. political changes, labor strikes, acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad. on june 23, 2016, voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union, which proposed exit (and the political, economic and other uncertainties it has raised) has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. negotiations on withdrawal and post-exit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted, and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements. the proposed withdrawal could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. the withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties. further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate. there can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 15 table of contents mckesson corporation in addition, foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. the u.k. bribery act, for example, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the u.k. bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to: (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities; (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand; (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, physical limitations, or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply; and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. for example, the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the u.s. from overseas plants due to quality issues. difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs. provincial governments in canada have introduced significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. for instance, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, provincial governments have taken steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs. these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, changes to the allowable amounts of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers, the tendering of generic molecules on provincial drug formularies as well as the tendering of drug distribution services by provincial governments. these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company's operations in canada. other provinces have implemented or are considering similar changes, which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. individually or in combination, such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit. general european economic conditions, together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the company's acquisition of celesio increased our assets and operations within europe and, accordingly, our exposure to economic conditions in europe. a slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services. a slowdown may also reduce the demand for our products. either of these could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. in recent years, in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe, a number of european governments, including the government in the united kingdom in the past year, have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures. these measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay. countries with existing healthcare-related austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. in addition, european governments that have not yet imposed healthcare-related austerity measures may impose them in the future. new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 16 table of contents mckesson corporation changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in europe, we are subject to the 1995 european union ( eu ) directive on data protection ( 1995 data protection directive ), which requires eu member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. the eu member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. in addition, certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards. in may 2018, the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) will supersede current eu data protection legislation, impose more stringent eu data protection requirements, and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our results of operations, which are stated in u.s. dollars, could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we conduct our business worldwide in u.s. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including euro, british pound sterling and canadian dollar. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in the u.s. dollar. for example, the day after the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union in june 2016, the british pound sterling fell by more than 10 percent against the u.s. dollar, to its lowest level in more than 30 years. the fall in the british pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar and euro, and the strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to a number of currencies including the british pound sterling and euro, could have significant impacts on the business and financial results. we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks. additionally, we may use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency exchange rate risks. these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place. our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully. an element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; and challenges retaining the customers of the combined businesses. further, acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed litigation and unknown liabilities. in addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets. if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including foreign exchange fluctuations, challenges of managing new domestic or international operations, and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of products and services. the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of any transaction will be realized or, if realized, the timing of its realization. it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated, and could result in the loss of employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements. any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 17 table of contents mckesson corporation any significant diversion of management's attention away from the ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition, transition and integration process, could adversely affect our financial results. moreover, the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of a transaction could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and could adversely affect our future business, financial position and operating results. events outside of our control, including changes in regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from a transaction. our results of operations could be impacted if our investment in change healthcare fails to perform as expected. on march 1, 2017, mckesson contributed the majority of its core mts business and change contributed substantially all of its businesses, excluding its pharmacy switch and prescription routing businesses, to form a joint venture, change healthcare. the purpose of the transaction was to create a new healthcare information technology company, bringing together the complementary strengths of the contributed assets to provide software and analytics, network solutions and technology-enabled services that will help customers obtain actionable insights, exchange mission-critical information, control costs, optimize revenue opportunities, increase cash flow and effectively navigate the shift to value-based healthcare. change healthcare is jointly governed by mckesson and change. operating a business under joint governance of unaffiliated, controlling members could lead to conflicts of interest or deadlocks on important and time-sensitive operational, financial or strategic decisions, and will require additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. if we are unable to manage our joint venture relationship and to realize the strategic and financial benefits that we expect, including an initial private offering of change healthcare, such inability to manage the relationship or realize benefits may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business and results of operations could be impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures. we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. we may also experience greater dissynergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. after reaching an agreement with a buyer, we are subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the sale. dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. from time to time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings involving false claims, healthcare fraud and abuse, antitrust, class actions, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, licensing, tort and other various claims. all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments. in some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. for some complaints filed against the company, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company. the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management's time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation. 18 table of contents mckesson corporation competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit. our distribution solutions segment faces a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. in addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. in all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation and, in some cases, convenience to the customer. in addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. as a result, a small number of very large pharmaceutical suppliers could control a significant share of the market. accordingly, we could depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers. many of our customers, including healthcare organizations that purchase our products and services, have also consolidated to create larger enterprises with greater market power. if this consolidation trend continues among our customers, suppliers and competitors, it could reduce the number of market participants and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services. it would also increase counter-party credit risk as the number of market participants decreases. in addition, when our customers combine, they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems, which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base. our technology solutions segment and mckesson rx technology solutions businesses experience substantial competition from many companies, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. these competitive pressures and industry consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization, as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. in recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers. during 2017 , sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations ( gpos ) accounted for approximately 54.2% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our largest customer, cvs health ( cvs ), accounted for approximately 20.2% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2017 , trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 33.7% of total trade accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs were approximately 17.8% of total trade accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with gpos, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. a material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured. any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow. further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. 19 table of contents mckesson corporation contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities. government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the u.s. false claims act, the procurement integrity act, the buy american act and the trade agreements act. we must also comply with various other domestic and foreign government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and oversight proceedings. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether contractors are complying with specific contractual or legal requirements. if we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement, or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by a government including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad. public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers. we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company's operating results. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we rely on sophisticated computer systems to perform our business operations. although we and our customers use a variety of security measures to protect our and their computer systems, a failure or compromise of our or our customers' computer systems from a cyberattack, natural disaster, or malfunction may result in material adverse operational and financial consequences. our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information, financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. we routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information, protected health information, financial information, and confidential information relating to our business or third parties. some of the data that we process, store and transmit may travel outside of the united states. additionally, we outsource some important it functions to external service providers worldwide. despite our implementation of a variety of physical, technical and administrative security measures, our and our customers' computer systems could be subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized access, such as physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. like other global companies, we and our customers have experienced threats to data and systems, including malware and ransomware attacks, unauthorized access, system failures, and disruptions. 20 table of contents mckesson corporation a failure or compromise of our or our customers' computer systems may jeopardize the confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information processed, stored, and transmitted through such computer systems. such an event may result in significant damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties, customer attrition, brand impairment, or other business harm. these risks may increase in the future as we continue to expand our internet and mobile strategies and to build an integrated digital enterprise. we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance. in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment's customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. one or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decision making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management's attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient. we also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. in addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. transactions like our acquisitions of celesio and rexall expose us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services. pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. although we maintain liability insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims. if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. proprietary protections may not be adequate, and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties. we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or services that are equivalent or superior to ours. in addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us, and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. if we were found to be infringing others' rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing products or services, obtain a license or cease selling or using the products or services that contain the infringing elements. additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. these litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 21 table of contents mckesson corporation system errors or failures of our products or services to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the software and technology services that we sell or operate are complex. as with complex systems offered by others, our software and technology services may contain errors, especially when first introduced. for example, our technology solutions segment systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care. therefore, users of our software and technology services have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. if clinicians' use of our software and technology services leads to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our customers, clinicians or patients. in addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales. failure of a customer's system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages. various risks could interrupt customers' access to their data residing in our service center, exposing us to significant costs. we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers. the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers. our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; and (4) cyberattacks, computer viruses, hacking and other similar disruptive problems. we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change controls, information security procedures, and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security, but our precautions may not protect against all risks. if customers' access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. if customers' access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our contractors or third party service providers, we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill, intangible assets, or investments become impaired. we are required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a divestiture, indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. there are inherent uncertainties in management's estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. our investment in change healthcare represents the fair value of our 70% equity interest in change healthcare upon closing. we may experience declines in its fair value. a decline in the fair value of our change healthcare investment may require that we review the carrying value for potential impairment, and such review could result in impairments and charges to our consolidated statements of operations. 22 table of contents mckesson corporation tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. from time to time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation. for example, if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes, it would adversely impact our cash flow. additionally, if legislation is passed to change the current u.s. taxation treatment of income from foreign operations, or if legislation is passed at the state level to establish or increase taxation on the basis of our gross revenues, it may adversely impact our tax expense. the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. for example, we operate in various countries that collect value added taxes ( vat ). the determination of the manner in which a vat applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws and regulations. although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, as jurisdictions enact legislation to implement the recommendations of the recently concluded base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development or as a result of the european commission's investigations into illegal state aid, changes to long-standing tax principles may result which could adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows. volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, or decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future. although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. additionally, if customers' or suppliers' operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms, may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements. our financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt, such as the amended guidance for revenue recognition and leases, may require changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our systems. such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. 23 table of contents mckesson corporation we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate, or if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities. we participate in various multiemployer pension plans. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make additional cash contributions to the plans in installments. our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. the multiemployer plans could have significant unfunded vested liabilities. such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. in addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and business process initiatives. on march 14, 2016, the company committed to a restructuring plan to lower its operating costs ( cost alignment plan ). the cost alignment plan primarily consists of a reduction in workforce and business process initiatives that will be substantially implemented prior to the end of 2019. expense reduction initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, our restructuring and business process initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results. we cannot guarantee that the activities under any restructuring and business initiative will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings. we may experience difficulties with outsourcing and similar third party relationships. our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted if we experience difficulties with outsourcing and managing similar third-party relationships. we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. if we fail to develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategies, such strategies prove to be ineffective or fail to provide expected cost savings, or our third party providers fail to perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties and increased costs may adversely affect the results of our operations. moreover, we utilize contractors and employees located outside of the united states to assist us in performing services or providing support for our customers. certain of these resources may have access to personal information, including protected health information. some of our customers have contractually limited or may seek to limit our ability to use our offshore resources which may increase our costs due to concerns regarding potential misuse of this information. further, congress and a number of states have considered legislation that would restrict the transmission of personal information of united states residents offshore. some proposals impose liability on healthcare businesses resulting from misuse or prohibited transmission of personal information to individuals or entities outside the united states and may require the prior consent of the identifiable patient. congress also has considered establishing a private civil cause of action enabling an individual to recover damages sustained as a result of a violation of these proposed restrictions. if our ability to utilize offshore resources is limited by our customers or legislative action, the work currently being performed offshore may be done at a lower margin or at a loss and we may be subject to sanctions if we are unable to comply with new legislative requirements. use of offshore resources may increase our risk of violating data security and privacy obligations to our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. we may face risks associated with our retail expansion. in recent years, we have expanded our retail operations through a number of acquisitions. as we expand our retail footprint, we may face risks that are different from those we currently encounter. our expansion into additional retail markets, such as those in europe and canada, could result in increased competitive, merchandising and distribution challenges. we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers to our retail locations due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands and our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. our ability to expand successfully will depend on acceptance of our retail store experience by customers, including our ability to design our stores in a manner that resonates locally and to offer the correct product assortment to appeal to consumers. furthermore, our continued growth in the retail sector may strain relations with certain of our distribution customers who also compete in the retail pharmacy sector. there can be no assurance that our retail locations will be received as well as, or achieve net sales or profitability levels consistent with, our projected targets or be comparable to those of our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us, or at all. if our retail expansion fails to achieve, or unable to sustain, acceptable net sales and profitability levels, our business, results of operations and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected. 24 table of contents mckesson corporation our retail stores may require additional management time and attention. failure to properly supervise the operation and maintain the consistency of the customer experience in those retail stores could result in loss of customers and potentially adversely affect our results of operations. we may be unable to keep existing retail store locations or open new retail locations in desirable places, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. we may be unable to keep existing retail locations or open new retail locations in desirable places in the future. we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable retail locations. local land use, local zoning issues, environmental regulations and other regulations may affect our ability to find suitable retail locations and also influence the cost of leasing or buying them. we also may have difficulty negotiating real estate leases for new stores, renewing real estate leases for existing stores or negotiating purchase agreements for new sites on acceptable terms. in addition, construction, environmental, zoning and real estate delays may negatively affect retail location openings and increase costs and capital expenditures. if we are unable to keep up our existing retail store locations or open new retail store locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk: our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. at march 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $2.8 billion and $4.0 billion and in cash and cash equivalents. the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2017 and 2016 of approximately $19 million and $26 million. foreign exchange risk: we conduct our business worldwide in u.s. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including euro, british pound sterling and canadian dollars. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in u.s. dollars. we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. we have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps. the forward contracts and cross currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk. as of march 31, 2017 and 2016, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $357 million and $131 million. however, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. refer to financial note 21, hedging activities, for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps. the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. 51 table of contents mckesson corporationrisk factors the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. 10 table of contents mckesson corporation changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. many of our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to enhance efficiencies, reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, changes in the basis for payments, shifting away from fee-for-service and towards value-based payments and risk-sharing models, increases in the use of managed care and consolidation in the healthcare industry. we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future. changes in the healthcare industry's or our pharmaceutical suppliers' pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. additionally, if we experience disruptions in our supply of generic drugs, our margins could be adversely affected. due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services. the majority of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide. however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. certain distribution business agreements we entered into with manufacturers continue to have pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation. consequently, our results of operations could be adversely affected if the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price increases or decreases, which we do not control. in addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation. our generic pharmaceutical sourcing program has benefited from the joint sourcing entity, clarusone. if clarusone does not continue to be successful, our margins could be adversely affected. our distribution solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical pricing trends over the last three years. continued volatility in the availability, pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs, or significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. additionally, any future changes in branded and generics drug pricing could be significantly different than our projections. generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. during the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product's patent. to the extent we source, contract manufacture, and distribute such generic products, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us. while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations. healthcare fraud: we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse. local, state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid. many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. the regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. 11 table of contents mckesson corporation reimbursements: both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. for example, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act (collectively the affordable care act ), signed into law in 2010, revised, subject to rulemaking, the federal upper limits ( ful ) for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis. on february 1, 2016, the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) published the covered outpatient drugs final rule. the final rule, with limited exceptions, establishes the ful to be 175% of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization across a drug molecule when multiple sources are available) of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price ( amp ). additionally, the final rule established actual acquisition cost as the basis by which states should determine their ingredient cost reimbursement, addressed the sufficiency of dispensing fees to reflect the cost of the pharmacist's professional services and cost to dispense drugs to medicaid beneficiaries, and clarified that states are required to evaluate the sufficiency of both ingredient cost and professional dispensing fee when proposing changes to either component. use of the revised amp-based ful may result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals, which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability. the federal government may adopt measures that could reduce medicare and/or medicaid spending, or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities. for example, under the terms of the budget control act of 2011, an automatic 2% reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after april 1, 2013. this automatic reduction is known as sequestration. medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of average sales price ( asp ) plus 6%. the implementation of sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6% level for the duration of sequestration (which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation). on september 20, 2017, cms issued a request for information seeking recommendations for payment models, which could include prescription drug models under medicare parts b and d and state medicaid programs. cms noted its interest in drug pricing and value-based purchasing models involving novel arrangements between plans, manufacturers, and stakeholders across the supply chain. additionally, cms published a proposed rule on july 20, 2017 that would cut medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs (other than vaccines) purchased through the 340b drug pricing program at asp minus 22.5% (with certain exceptions), rather than asp plus 6%. cms finalized this rule on november 1, 2017. as another example, the medicare access and chip reauthorization act ( macra ), signed into law in april 2015, seeks to reform medicare reimbursement policy for physician fee schedule services and adopts a series of policy changes affecting a wide range of providers and suppliers. most notably, macra repeals the statutory sustainable growth rate formula, which has called for cuts in medicare rates in recent years, but which congress routinely stepped in to override the full application of the formula. instead, after a period of stable payment updates, macra links physician payment updates to quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models. macra also extends certain expiring medicare and other health policy provisions, including extending the children's health insurance program. additionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program, or both. we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions, if any, will ultimately be enacted into law, or the timing or affect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us. there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. operating, security and licensure standards: we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration ( dea ), the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ), the cms and other comparable agencies. certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the dea, fda, hhs, cms, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. for example, we are required to hold valid dea and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, distribution, and disposal of controlled substances. as part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. in some instances, these can lead to monetary penalties and/or license revocation. in january 2017, we reached an agreement with the dea and department of justice pursuant to which we paid the sum of $150 million to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company's suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances. the dea is suspending, on a staggered basis for limited periods of time, mckesson's dea registrations to distribute certain controlled substances from four mckesson distribution centers. 12 table of contents mckesson corporation although we have enhanced our procedures to ensure compliance, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. pedigree tracking: there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, otherwise known as pedigree tracking. in november 2013, congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act ( dqsa ). the dqsa establishes federal standards requiring supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable, lot-level prescription drug track and trace system. the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements. the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers, including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities. in addition, the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007, which went into effect on october 1, 2007, requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices, 2d data matrix barcodes and other similar technologies. on march 26, 2010, the fda released the serialized numerical identifier ( sni ) guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging. we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations. the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. privacy: there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. in particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (known as protected health information ) and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. we are directly subject to certain provisions of the regulations as a business associate through our relationships with customers. we are also directly subject to the hipaa privacy and security regulations as a covered entity with respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse, specialty pharmacy and medical surgical supply business. the privacy regulations established under hipaa also provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their protected health information is used and disclosed. to the extent permitted by applicable privacy regulations and our contracts with our customers, we may use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, such as creating de-identified information. other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations. determining whether protected health information has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the hipaa privacy standards and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation. if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of protected health information entrusted to us, we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers. further, if we fail to comply with applicable hipaa privacy and security standards, we could face civil and criminal penalties. hhs performs compliance audits of covered entities and business associates and enforces the hipaa privacy and security standards. hhs has become an increasingly active regulator and has signaled its intention to continue this trend. hhs has the discretion to impose penalties without being required to attempt to resolve violations through informal means, such as implementing a corrective action plan. hhs enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm, and responses to such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources. in addition to enforcement by hhs, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. although we have implemented and maintain policies and processes to assist us in complying with these regulations and our contractual obligations, we cannot provide assurance regarding how these regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. in addition to the risks associated with enforcement activities and potential contractual liabilities, our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and state level might also require us to make costly system purchases and/or modifications from time to time. 13 table of contents mckesson corporation healthcare reform : the affordable care act ( aca ) significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. while certain provisions of the aca took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement and/or finalize (e.g. nondiscrimination in health programs and activities, excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage). further, as a result of the november 2016 u.s. presidential election, there are continued uncertainties associated with efforts to change or repeal certain provisions of the aca or other healthcare reforms, and we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time. a top legislative priority of the new presidential administration and congress may be significant reform of the aca, as discussed above. while there is currently a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood, timing and details of any such policies and reforms, such policies and reforms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. fda regulation of medical software: the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the federal food, drug and cosmetic act. for example, in february 2015, the fda issued guidance to inform manufacturers and distributors of medical device data systems that it did not intend to enforce compliance with regulatory controls that apply to medical device data systems, medical image storage devices, and medical image communication devices. if the fda chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices, or subsequently changes or reverses its guidance regarding not enforcing regulatory controls for certain medical device products, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the fda could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. any additional fda regulations governing health information technology products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products. in december 2016, congress passed and the president signed into law the 21st century cures act. the 21st century cures act changes the way health it would be regulated by the fda. the bill also carves most health it products out of the fda's jurisdiction, but includes a clawback provision that would enable fda to regulate products on a case-by-case basis if it determined they pose a risk to patient safety. medical billing and coding: medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws. in connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare, medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we have operations based in, and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products in, a number of foreign countries. moreover, in europe, mckesson europe ag ( mckesson europe ), formerly known as celesio ag, operates as a wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector. our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks including changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies; unexpected regulatory, social, political, or economic changes in a specific country or region; changes in intellectual property, privacy and data protection; import/export regulations and trade sanctions in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. political changes, labor strikes, acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad. on june 23, 2016, voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union, which proposed exit (and the political, economic and other uncertainties it has raised) has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. negotiations on withdrawal and post-exit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted, and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements. the proposed withdrawal could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. the withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties. further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate. there can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 14 table of contents mckesson corporation in addition, foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. the u.k. bribery act, for example, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the u.k. bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to: (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities; (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand; (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, physical limitations, or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply; and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. for example, the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the u.s. from overseas plants due to quality issues. difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs. provincial governments in canada have introduced significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. for instance, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, provincial governments have taken and will continue to take steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs. these changes include increased powers of investigation, reporting and enforcement for provincial regulatory agencies, the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, changes to the allowable amounts of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers and the tendering of generic molecules on provincial drug formularies. these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company's operations in canada. additional provinces have implemented or are considering similar changes, which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. individually or in combination, such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit. general european economic conditions, together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. a slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services. a slowdown may also reduce the demand for our products. either of these could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. in recent years, in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe, a number of european governments, including the government in the united kingdom in the past year, have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures. these measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay. countries with existing healthcare-related austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. in addition, european governments that have not yet imposed healthcare-related austerity measures may impose them in the future. new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 15 table of contents mckesson corporation changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in europe, beginning may 25, 2018, we are subject to the general data protection regulation, which requires eu member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. the eu member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. in addition, certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our results of operations, which are stated in u.s. dollars, could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we conduct our business worldwide in u.s. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including euro, british pound sterling and canadian dollar. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks. additionally, we may use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency exchange rate risks. these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place. our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully. an element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; and challenges retaining the customers of the combined businesses. further, acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed litigation and unknown liabilities. in addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets. if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including foreign exchange fluctuations, challenges of managing new domestic or international operations, and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of products and services. the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of any transaction will be realized or, if realized, the timing of its realization. it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated, and could result in the loss of employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements. any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. any significant diversion of management's attention away from the ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition, transition and integration process, could adversely affect our financial results. moreover, the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of a transaction could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and could adversely affect our future business, financial position and operating results. events outside of our control, including changes in regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from a transaction. 16 table of contents mckesson corporation our results of operations could be impacted if our investment in change healthcare fails to perform as expected. on march 1, 2017, mckesson contributed the majority of its core mts business and change contributed substantially all of its businesses, excluding its pharmacy switch and prescription routing businesses, to form a joint venture, change healthcare. the purpose of the transaction was to create a new healthcare information technology company, bringing together the complementary strengths of the contributed assets to provide software and analytics, network solutions and technology-enabled services that will help customers obtain actionable insights, exchange mission-critical information, control costs, optimize revenue opportunities, increase cash flow and effectively navigate the shift to value-based healthcare. change healthcare is jointly governed by mckesson and change. operating a business under joint governance of unaffiliated, controlling members could lead to conflicts of interest or deadlocks on important and time-sensitive operational, financial or strategic decisions, and will require additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. if we are unable to manage our joint venture relationship and to realize the strategic and financial benefits that we expect, including an initial public offering of change healthcare, such inability to manage the relationship or realize benefits may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business and results of operations could be impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures. we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. we may also experience greater dissynergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. after reaching an agreement with a buyer, we are subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the sale. dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. from time to time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings involving false claims, healthcare fraud and abuse, antitrust, class actions, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, licensing, tort and other various claims. for example, the company is a defendant in many cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances to pharmacies, often together with other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail pharmacy chains named as defendants. the company has been served with many complaints, often brought by governmental entities (including counties and municipalities) that allege violations of controlled substance laws and various other statutes in addition to common law claims, including negligence and public nuisance, and seek monetary damages and equitable relief. some states and other governmental entities have indicated that they are considering filing similar suits. all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments. in some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. for some complaints filed against the company, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company. the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management's time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation. 17 table of contents mckesson corporation competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit. our distribution solutions segment (and commencing in first quarter of 2019, our reportable segments including u.s. pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, european pharmaceutical solutions, medical-surgical solutions and other) faces a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. in addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. in all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation and, in some cases, convenience to the customer. in addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. as a result, a small number of very large pharmaceutical suppliers could control a significant share of the market. accordingly, we could depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers. many of our customers, including healthcare organizations that purchase our products and services, have also consolidated to create larger enterprises with greater market power. if this consolidation trend continues among our customers, suppliers and competitors, it could reduce the number of market participants and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services. it would also increase counter-party credit risk as the number of market participants decreases. in addition, when our customers combine, they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems, which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base. our mckesson prescription technology solutions business experiences substantial competition from many companies, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. these competitive pressures and industry consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization, as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. in recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers. during 2018 , sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations ( gpos ) accounted for approximately 51.7% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our largest customer, cvs health ( cvs ), accounted for approximately 19.9% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2018 , trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 24.9% of total trade accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs were approximately 16.4% of total trade accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with gpos, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. a material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured. any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow. further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. 18 table of contents mckesson corporation contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities. government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the u.s. false claims act, the procurement integrity act, the buy american act and the trade agreements act. we must also comply with various other domestic and foreign government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and oversight proceedings. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether contractors are complying with specific contractual or legal requirements. if we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement, or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by a government including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad. public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers. we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company's operating results. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we rely on sophisticated computer systems to perform our business operations. although we, our customers and our external service providers use a variety of security measures to protect our and their computer systems, a failure or compromise of our, our customers' or our external service providers' computer systems from a cyberattack, natural disaster, or malfunction may result in material adverse operational and financial consequences. our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, protected health information, financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. we routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information, protected health information, financial information, and confidential information relating to our business or third parties. some of the data that we process, store and transmit may travel outside of the united states. additionally, we outsource some important it functions to external service providers worldwide. our industry is subject to various evolving federal, state and international data and security laws and regulations, which impose operational costs to achieve compliance. any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in regulatory enforcement activity and fines. in addition, compliance with these requirements could require changes in business practices, complicate our operations, and increase our oversight needs. 19 table of contents mckesson corporation the constant evolution of cyberattacks has caused us to spend more time and money to deal with increasingly sophisticated attacks. despite our implementation of a variety of physical, technical and administrative security measures, our, our customers' and our external service providers' computer systems could be subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized access, such as physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. like other global companies, we and our customers have experienced threats to data and systems, including malware and ransomware attacks, unauthorized access, system failures, and disruptions. a failure or compromise of our, our customers' or our external service providers' computer systems may result in business disruption or jeopardize the confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information processed, stored, and transmitted through such computer systems. such an event may result in significant damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties, notification costs, remediation expenses, customer attrition, brand impairment, or other business harm. these risks may increase in the future as we continue to expand our internet and mobile strategies and to build an integrated digital enterprise. we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance. in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment's customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. one or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decision making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management's attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient. we also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. in addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. transactions like our acquisitions of mckesson europe and rexall health expose us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services. pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. although we maintain liability insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims. if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. proprietary protections may not be adequate, and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties. we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or services that are equivalent or superior to ours. in addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us, and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. if we were found to be infringing others' rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing products or services, obtain a license or cease selling or using the products or services that contain the infringing elements. additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. these litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 20 table of contents mckesson corporation system errors or failures of our products or services to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the software and technology services that we sell or operate are complex. as with complex systems offered by others, our software and technology services may contain errors, especially when first introduced. for example, some of our systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care. therefore, users of our software and technology services have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. if clinicians' use of our software and technology services leads to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our customers, clinicians or patients. in addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales. failure of a customer's system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages. various risks could interrupt customers' access to their data residing in our service center, exposing us to significant costs. we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers. the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers. our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; and (4) cyberattacks, computer viruses, hacking and other similar disruptive problems. we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change controls, information security procedures, and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security, but our precautions may not protect against all risks. if customers' access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. if customers' access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our contractors or third-party service providers, we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets, or investments become impaired. we are required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a divestiture, indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible and other long-lived assets is determined. this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. there are inherent uncertainties in management's estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, a deterioration in the u.s. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. 21 table of contents mckesson corporation our investment in change healthcare represents the fair value of our 70% equity interest in change healthcare upon closing. we may experience declines in its fair value. a decline in the fair value of our change healthcare investment may require that we review the carrying value for potential impairment, and such review could result in an impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations. tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. from time to time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation. on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "2017 tax act") was enacted and contains significant changes to u.s. income tax law. effective in 2018, the 2017 tax act reduces the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%. effective in 2019, it creates new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. in addition, we were subject to a one-time transition tax in 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to u.s. income tax. the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118") on december 22, 2017, which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended march 31, 2018, in accordance with sab 118. the u.s. treasury department and irs have not yet issued regulations with respect to the 2017 tax act. due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 tax act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, material adjustments to our tax estimates impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share, as well as our cash flows, in the period in which any such adjustments are made. refer to financial note 10, income taxes, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. for example, we operate in various countries that collect value added taxes ( vat ). the determination of the manner in which a vat applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws and regulations. although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, as jurisdictions enact legislation to implement the recommendations of the recently concluded base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development or as a result of the european commission's investigations into illegal state aid, changes to long-standing tax principles may result which could adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows. volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, or decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future. although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. 22 table of contents mckesson corporation our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. additionally, if customers' or suppliers' operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms, may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt, such as the amended guidance for leases, may require changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our systems. such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate, or if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is underfunded. we participate in various multiemployer pension plans. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make additional cash contributions to the plans in installments. our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. the multiemployer plans could have significant unfunded vested liabilities. such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. in addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and business process initiatives. from time to time, the company may enter into restructuring and business process initiatives. in april 2018, the company announced a multi-year strategic growth initiative focused on creating innovative new solutions that improve patient care delivery and drive incremental profit growth. the initiative includes a comprehensive review of the company's operations and cost structure, designed to increase efficiency, accelerate execution and improve long-term performance. in march 2016, the company also committed to a restructuring plan to lower its operating costs ( cost alignment plan ). the cost alignment plan primarily consists of a reduction in workforce and business process initiatives that will be substantially implemented prior to the end of 2019. these types of initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, our restructuring and business process initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results. we cannot guarantee that the activities under any restructuring and business initiative will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings. we may experience difficulties with outsourcing and similar third-party relationships. our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted if we experience difficulties with outsourcing and managing similar third-party relationships. we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. if we fail to develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategies, such strategies prove to be ineffective or fail to provide expected cost savings, or our third-party providers fail to perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties and increased costs may adversely affect the results of our operations. 23 table of contents mckesson corporation moreover, we utilize contractors and employees located outside of the united states to assist us in performing services or providing support for our customers. certain of these resources may have access to personal information, including protected health information. some of our customers have contractually limited or may seek to limit our ability to use our offshore resources which may increase our costs due to concerns regarding potential misuse of this information. further, congress and a number of states have considered legislation that would restrict the transmission of personal information of united states residents offshore. some proposals impose liability on healthcare businesses resulting from misuse or prohibited transmission of personal information to individuals or entities outside the united states and may require the prior consent of the identifiable patient. congress also has considered establishing a private civil cause of action enabling an individual to recover damages sustained as a result of a violation of these proposed restrictions. if our ability to utilize offshore resources is limited by our customers or legislative action, the work currently being performed offshore may be done at a lower margin or at a loss and we may be subject to sanctions if we are unable to comply with new legislative requirements. use of offshore resources may increase our risk of violating data security and privacy obligations to our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. we may face risks associated with our retail expansion. in recent years, we have expanded our retail operations through a number of acquisitions. as we expand our retail footprint, we may face risks that are different from those we currently encounter. our expansion into additional retail markets, such as those in europe and canada, could result in increased competitive, merchandising and distribution challenges. we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers to our retail locations due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands and our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. our ability to expand successfully will depend on acceptance of our retail store experience by customers, including our ability to design our stores in a manner that resonates locally and to offer the correct product assortment to appeal to consumers. furthermore, our continued growth in the retail sector may strain relations with certain of our distribution customers who also compete in the retail pharmacy sector. there can be no assurance that our retail locations will be received as well as, or achieve net sales or profitability levels consistent with, our projected targets or be comparable to those of our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us, or at all. if our retail expansion fails to achieve, or unable to sustain, acceptable net sales and profitability levels, our business, results of operations and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected. our retail stores may require additional management time and attention. failure to properly supervise the operation and maintain the consistency of the customer experience in those retail stores could result in loss of customers and potentially adversely affect our results of operations. we may be unable to keep existing retail store locations or open new retail locations in desirable places, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. we may be unable to keep existing retail locations or open new retail locations in desirable places in the future. we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable retail locations. local land use, local zoning issues, environmental regulations and other regulations may affect our ability to find suitable retail locations and also influence the cost of leasing or buying them. we also may have difficulty negotiating real estate leases for new stores, renewing real estate leases for existing stores or negotiating purchase agreements for new sites on acceptable terms. in addition, construction, environmental, zoning and real estate delays may negatively affect retail location openings and increase costs and capital expenditures. if we are unable to keep up our existing retail store locations or open new retail store locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk: our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. at march 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion and in cash and cash equivalents. the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2018 and 2017 of approximately $10 million and $19 million. foreign exchange risk: we conduct our business worldwide in u.s. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including euro, british pound sterling and canadian dollars. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in u.s. dollars. we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. we have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. the forward contracts and cross-currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk. as of march 31, 2018 and 2017, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $458 million and $357 million. however, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. refer to financial note 20, hedging activities, for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. 58 table of contents mckesson corporationrisk factors the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. many of our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to enhance efficiencies, reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, changes in the basis for payments, shifting away from fee-for-service and towards value-based payments and risk-sharing models, increases in the use of managed care and consolidation in the healthcare industry. we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future. changes in the healthcare industry's or our pharmaceutical suppliers' pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. additionally, if we experience disruptions in our supply of generic drugs, our margins could be adversely affected. due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services. the majority of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide. failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. certain distribution business agreements with manufacturers continue to have pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation. consequently, our results of operations could be adversely affected if the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price increases or decreases, which we do not control. in addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation. our generic pharmaceutical sourcing program has benefited from sourcing through our joint venture with walmart, inc., clarusone. if clarusone does not continue to be successful, our margins could be adversely affected. our u.s. pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical pricing trends over the last three years. continued volatility in the availability, pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs, or significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. additionally, any future changes in branded and generics drug pricing could be significantly different than our projections. generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. during the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product's patent. to the extent we source, contract manufacture, and distribute such generic products, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us. while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations. 10 table of contents mckesson corporation healthcare fraud: we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse. local, state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid. many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. the regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions, and could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. reimbursements: our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates (including government rates) for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services, imposing additional requirements on healthcare entities, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. for example, on october 25, 2018, the department of health &amp; human services ( hhs ) announced its intent to propose an international pricing index ( ipi ) payment model to reduce government payments for medicare part b drugs to levels more closely aligned with prices paid in other countries. if proposed and finalized, the far-reaching model could reduce part b drug reimbursement by 30 percent between 2020 and 2025. the model would eliminate the buy and bill model and reintroduce the competitive acquisition program ( cap ). this could allow private vendors (including non-wholesaler entities) to procure and distribute drugs to physicians and hospitals, while medicare would pay the vendor for the included drugs based on the target price driven by the ipi. also, on january 31, 2019, the hhs office of inspector general released the removal of safe harbor protection for rebates to plans or pharmacy benefit managers ( pbm ) involving prescription pharmaceuticals and creation of new safe harbor protection proposed rule. if finalized, the proposal would create significant change in the pharmaceutical value chain as manufacturers, pbm, managed care organizations and other industry stakeholders look to implement new transactional flows and adapt their business models. additionally, federal and state lawmakers are increasingly exploring other policy proposals to reduce drug price, including price transparency measurers and drug reimportation. there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. operating, security and licensure standards: we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration ( dea ), the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, hhs, the centers for medicare &amp; medicaid services ( cms ) and other comparable agencies. certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the dea, fda, hhs, cms, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. for example, we are required to hold valid dea and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, distribution, and disposal of controlled substances. as part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. in some instances, these can lead to monetary penalties and/or license revocation. in january 2017, we reached an agreement with the dea and department of justice pursuant to which we paid $150 million to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company's suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances. the dea suspended, on a staggered basis for limited periods of time, mckesson's dea registrations to distribute certain controlled substances from four mckesson distribution centers. as of march 31, 2019, staggered suspensions have expired for two dea registrations and two remain applicable. 11 table of contents mckesson corporation although we have enhanced our procedures to ensure compliance, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. pedigree tracking: there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, otherwise known as pedigree tracking. in november 2013, congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act ( dqsa ). the dqsa establishes federal standards requiring supply-chain stakeholders to participate in a prescription drug track and trace system. track and trace began in 2015 at the lot-level and evolves to a serialized level electronic, interoperable system by november 2023. the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements. the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers, including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities. in addition, the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include track and trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices, 2d data matrix barcodes and other similar technologies. on march 26, 2010, the fda released the serialized numerical identifier ( sni ) guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging. we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations. the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. privacy: there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. in particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (known as protected health information ) and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. we are directly subject to certain provisions of the regulations as a business associate through our relationships with customers. we are also directly subject to the hipaa privacy and security regulations as a covered entity with respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse, specialty pharmacy and medical surgical supply business. the privacy regulations established under hipaa also provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their protected health information is used and disclosed. to the extent permitted by applicable privacy regulations and our contracts with our customers, we may use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, such as creating de-identified information. other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations. determining whether protected health information has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the hipaa privacy standards and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation. if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of protected health information entrusted to us, we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers. further, if we fail to comply with applicable hipaa privacy and security standards, we could face civil and criminal penalties. hhs performs compliance audits of covered entities and business associates and enforces the hipaa privacy and security standards. hhs has become an increasingly active regulator and has signaled its intention to continue this trend. hhs has the discretion to impose penalties without being required to attempt to resolve violations through informal means, such as implementing a corrective action plan. hhs enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm, and responses to such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources. in addition to enforcement by hhs, state attorney generals are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. although we have implemented and maintained policies and processes to assist us in complying with these regulations and our contractual obligations, we cannot provide assurance regarding how these regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. in addition to the risks associated with enforcement activities and potential contractual liabilities, our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and state level, including the california consumer protection act, which becomes effective in 2020, might also require us to make costly system purchases and/or modifications from time to time. 12 table of contents mckesson corporation healthcare reform : the affordable care act ( aca ) significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. while certain provisions of the aca took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement and/or finalize (e.g. nondiscrimination in health programs and activities, excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage). further, as a result of the november 2016 u.s. presidential election and the november 2018 midterm election, there are continued uncertainties associated with efforts to change or repeal certain provisions of the aca as well as moves to achieve universal healthcare coverage. while there is currently a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood, timing and details of any such policies and reforms, such policies and reforms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we have operations based in, and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products in, a number of foreign countries. moreover, in europe, mckesson europe ag ( mckesson europe ), formerly known as celesio ag, operates as a wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector. our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks including changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies; unexpected regulatory, social, political, or economic changes in a specific country or region such as the reduction of reimbursement rates within the national health service in the united kingdom ( u.k. ); changes in intellectual property, privacy and data protection; import/export regulations and trade sanctions in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. for example, the falsified medicines directive became operational in most european union ( eu ) countries on february 9, 2019 and required implementing safety features for medicines, including a unique identifier (a two-dimension barcode) and an anti-tampering device on outer packaging. political changes, labor strikes, acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. in june 2016, voters in the u.k. approved a referendum to withdraw the u.k.'s membership from the eu, commonly referred to as "brexit". in march 2017, the u.k. government officially gave notice to leave, starting a two-year negotiation process. the resulting withdrawal agreement was intended to ensure continuity, as the u.k. could remain a de facto member until the end of 2020, during which time the two sides could negotiate their future political and trade relations. however, the u.k. legislature has declined to ratify the withdrawal agreement, and no alternative agreement has been negotiated to govern the withdrawal of the u.k. from the eu. the u.k. and the eu agreed to an extension of the deadline for withdrawal until october 31, 2019, although the u.k. could leave the eu sooner than that date if the withdrawal agreement is ratified, or if the parties reach an alternative agreement governing the withdrawal of the u.k. from the eu. if no agreement is reached and the u.k. leaves the eu after the october 31, 2019 deadline, significant trade barriers would exist between the eu and the u.k. we have operations in the u.k. and the eu, and as a result, we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and disruptions that may lead up to and follow brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and potential material changes to the regulatory regime applicable to our operations in the u.k. brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. for example, depending on the terms of brexit, the u.k. could also lose access to the single eu market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members. disruptions and uncertainty caused by brexit may also cause our clients to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget on our solutions and services. any of these effects of brexit, and others we cannot anticipate or that may evolve over time, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 13 table of contents mckesson corporation in addition, foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. the u.k. bribery act, for example, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the u.k. bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to: (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities; (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand; (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, physical limitations, or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply; and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. for example, the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the u.s. from overseas plants due to quality issues. difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs. provincial governments in canada have introduced significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. for instance, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, provincial governments have taken and will continue to take steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs. these changes include increased powers of investigation, reporting and enforcement for provincial regulatory agencies, the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, changes to the allowable amounts of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers and the tendering of generic molecules on provincial drug formularies. these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company's operations in canada. additional provinces have implemented or are considering similar changes, which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. individually or in combination, such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit. general european economic conditions, together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. a slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services. a slowdown may also reduce the demand for our products. either of these could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. in recent years, in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe, a number of european governments, including the government in the u.k. in the past year, have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures. these measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay. countries with existing healthcare-related austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. in addition, european governments that have not yet imposed healthcare-related austerity measures may impose them in the future. new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 14 table of contents mckesson corporation changes in the foreign regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. personal data is highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate. in addition, some of the data that we process, store and transmit may travel outside of the united states. in europe, we are subject to the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) and in canada, we are subject to the personal information protection and electronic documents act ( pipeda ). the gdpr and pipeda impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. the eu member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders. we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our results of operations, which are stated in u.s. dollars, could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we conduct our business worldwide in u.s. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including euro, british pound sterling and canadian dollars. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in u.s. dollars. we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks. additionally, we may use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency exchange rate risks. these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place. our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully. an element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; and challenges retaining the customers of the combined businesses. further, acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed litigation and unknown liabilities. in addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets. if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including foreign exchange fluctuations, challenges of managing new domestic or international operations, and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of products and services. the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of any transaction will be realized or, if realized, the timing of its realization. it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated, and could result in the loss of employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements. any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. any significant diversion of management's attention away from the ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition, transition and integration process, could adversely affect our financial results. moreover, the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of a transaction could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and could adversely affect our future business, financial position and operating results. events outside of our control, including changes in regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from a transaction. 15 table of contents mckesson corporation our results of operations could be impacted if our investment in change healthcare fails to perform as expected. on march 1, 2017, mckesson contributed the majority of our core mts business and change contributed substantially all of its businesses, excluding its pharmacy switch and prescription routing businesses, to form a joint venture, change healthcare. the purpose of the transaction was to create a new healthcare information technology company, bringing together the complementary strengths of the contributed assets to provide software and analytics, network solutions and technology-enabled services that will help customers obtain actionable insights, exchange mission-critical information, control costs, optimize revenue opportunities, increase cash flow and effectively navigate the shift to value-based healthcare. change healthcare is jointly governed by mckesson and change. operating a business under joint governance of unaffiliated, controlling members could lead to conflicts of interest or deadlocks on important and time-sensitive operational, financial or strategic decisions, and will require additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. if we are unable to manage our joint venture relationship and to realize the strategic and financial benefits that we expect, including an initial public offering of change healthcare inc., such inability to manage the relationship or realize benefits may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business and results of operations could be impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures. we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. we may also experience greater dissynergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. after reaching an agreement with a buyer, we are subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the sale. dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. from time to time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings involving false claims, healthcare fraud and abuse, antitrust, class actions, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, licensing, tort and other various claims. for example, the company is a defendant in many cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances to pharmacies, often together with other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail pharmacy chains named as defendants. the company has been served with many complaints, often brought by governmental entities (including counties and municipalities) that allege violations of controlled substance laws and various other statutes in addition to common law claims, including negligence and public nuisance, and seek monetary damages and equitable relief. some states and other governmental entities have indicated that they are considering filing similar suits. all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments. in some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. for some complaints filed against the company, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company. the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management's time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation. it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. 16 table of contents mckesson corporation competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit. our businesses face a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. in addition, our businesses face competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by our businesses. in all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation and, in some cases, convenience to the customer. in addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. as a result, a small number of very large pharmaceutical suppliers could control a significant share of the market. accordingly, we could depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers. many of our customers, including healthcare organizations that purchase our products and services, have also consolidated to create larger enterprises with greater market power. if this consolidation trend continues among our customers, suppliers and competitors, it could reduce the number of market participants and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services. it would also increase counter-party credit risk as the number of market participants decreases. in addition, when our customers combine, they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems, which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base. our mckesson prescription technology solutions business experiences substantial competition from many companies, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. these competitive pressures and industry consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization, as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. in recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers. during 2019 , sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations ( gpos ) accounted for approximately 49.9% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our largest customer, cvs health ( cvs ), accounted for approximately 19.4% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2019 , trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 31.9% of total trade accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs were approximately 18.4% of total trade accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with gpos, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. a material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured. any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow. further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. 17 table of contents mckesson corporation contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities. government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the u.s. false claims act, the procurement integrity act, the buy american act and the trade agreements act. we must also comply with various other domestic and foreign government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and oversight proceedings. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether contractors are complying with specific contractual or legal requirements. if we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement, or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by a government including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our future results could be materially affected by public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad. public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers. we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company's operating results. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we rely on sophisticated computer systems to perform our business operations. although we, our customers, our strategic partners and our external service providers use a variety of security measures to protect our and their computer systems, a failure or compromise of our, our customers', our strategic partners' or our external service providers' computer systems from a cyberattack, natural disaster, or malfunction may result in material adverse operational and financial consequences. our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information and other types of personal information, confidential financial information, proprietary information, and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. we routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information, protected health information, financial information, and confidential information relating to our business or third parties. additionally, we outsource some important it functions to external service providers worldwide. our industry is subject to various evolving federal, state and international data and security laws and regulations, which impose operational costs to achieve compliance. any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in regulatory enforcement activity and the imposition of fines and other costs. in addition, compliance with these requirements could require changes in business practices, complicate our operations, and increase our oversight needs. 18 table of contents mckesson corporation the constant evolution of cyberattacks has caused us to spend more time and money to deal with increasingly sophisticated attacks. despite our implementation of a variety of physical, technical and administrative security measures, our, our customers' and our external service providers' computer systems could be subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized access, such as physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. like other global companies, we and our customers have experienced threats to data and systems, including malware and ransomware attacks, unauthorized access, system failures, user errors and disruptions. a failure or compromise of our, our customers', our strategic partners' or our external service providers' computer systems may result in business disruption or jeopardize the sensitive information processed, stored, and transmitted through such computer systems. such an event may result in significant damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties, notification costs, remediation expenses, customer attrition, brand impairment, or other business harm. these risks may increase in the future as we continue to expand our internet and mobile strategies and to build an integrated digital enterprise. we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance. in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. one or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decision making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management's attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient. we also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. in addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. transactions like our acquisitions of mckesson europe and rexall health expose us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services. pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. although we maintain liability insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims. if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. proprietary protections may not be adequate, and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties. we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or services that are equivalent or superior to ours. in addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us, and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. if we were found to be infringing others' rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing products or services, obtain a license or cease selling or using the products or services that contain the infringing elements. additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. these litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 19 table of contents mckesson corporation system errors or failures of our products or services to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the software and technology services that we sell or operate are complex. as with complex systems offered by others, our software and technology services may contain errors, especially when first introduced. for example, some of our systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care. therefore, users of our software and technology services have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. if clinicians' use of our software and technology services leads to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our customers, clinicians or patients. in addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales. failure of a customer's system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages. various risks could interrupt customers' access to their data residing in our service center, exposing us to significant costs. we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers. the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers. our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; and (4) cyberattacks, computer viruses, hacking and other similar disruptive problems. we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change controls, information security procedures, and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security, but our precautions may not protect against all risks. if customers' access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. if customers' access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our contractors or third-party service providers, we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets, or investments become further impaired. we are required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a divestiture, indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible and other long-lived assets is determined. this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. there are inherent uncertainties in management's estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, a deterioration in the u.s. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. 20 table of contents mckesson corporation our investment in change healthcare represents the fair value of our 70% equity interest in change healthcare. we may experience declines in its fair value. a decline in the fair value of our change healthcare investment may require that we review the carrying value for potential impairment, and such review could result in an impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations. tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. from time to time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "2017 tax act"), which was comprehensive new tax legislation. the 2017 tax act made broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code, including but not limited to reducing the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax, creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-income and generally eliminating u.s. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries. in addition, we were subject to a one-time transition tax in 2018 on certain accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries not previously subject to u.s. income tax. our accounting for the impact of the 2017 tax act was completed as of the period ended december 31, 2018. the u.s. treasury department and irs continue to issue regulations with respect to the 2017 tax act. due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 tax act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, material adjustments to our tax estimates may impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share, as well as our cash flows, in the period in which any such adjustments are made. refer to financial note 10, income taxes, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. for example, we operate in various countries that collect value added taxes ( vat ). the determination of the manner in which a vat applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws and regulations. although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, as jurisdictions enact legislation to implement the recommendations of the recently concluded base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development or as a result of the european commission's investigations into illegal state aid, changes to long-standing tax principles may result which could adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows. we are currently subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess tax liabilities against us. developments in ongoing examinations could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share, as well as our cash flows, in the period in which any such adjustments are made, and for prior and subsequent periods. we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of any ongoing tax controversy could be materially different from our historical tax accruals. volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, or decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future. although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. 21 table of contents mckesson corporation our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. additionally, if customers' or suppliers' operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms, may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt may require changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our systems. such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate, or if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is underfunded. we participate in various multiemployer pension plans. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make additional cash contributions to the plans in installments. our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. the multiemployer plans could have significant unfunded vested liabilities. such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. in addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and business process initiatives. from time to time, the company may enter into restructuring and business process initiatives. these types of initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, our restructuring and business process initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results. we cannot guarantee that the activities under any restructuring and business initiative will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings. we may experience difficulties with outsourcing and similar third-party relationships. our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted if we experience difficulties with outsourcing and managing similar third-party relationships. we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. if we fail to develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategies, such strategies prove to be ineffective or fail to provide expected cost savings, or our third-party providers fail to perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties and increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations. 22 table of contents mckesson corporation moreover, we utilize contractors and employees located outside of the united states to assist us in performing services or providing support for our customers. certain of these resources may have access to personal information, including protected health information. some of our customers have contractually limited or may seek to limit our ability to use our offshore resources which may increase our costs due to concerns regarding potential misuse of this information. further, congress and a number of states have considered legislation that would restrict the transmission of personal information of united states residents offshore. some proposals impose liability on healthcare businesses resulting from misuse or prohibited transmission of personal information to individuals or entities outside the united states and may require the prior consent of the identifiable patient. congress also has considered establishing a private civil cause of action enabling an individual to recover damages sustained as a result of a violation of these proposed restrictions. if our ability to utilize offshore resources is limited by our customers or legislative action, the work currently being performed offshore may be done at a lower margin or at a loss and we may be subject to sanctions if we are unable to comply with new legislative requirements. use of offshore resources may increase our risk of violating data security and privacy obligations to our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. we may face risks associated with our retail expansion. in recent years, we have expanded our retail operations through a number of acquisitions. as we expand our retail footprint, we may face risks that are different from those we currently encounter. our expansion into additional retail markets, such as those in europe and canada, could result in increased competitive, merchandising and distribution challenges. we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers to our retail locations due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands and our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. our ability to expand successfully will depend on acceptance of our retail store experience by customers, including our ability to design our stores in a manner that resonates locally and to offer the correct product assortment to appeal to consumers. furthermore, our continued growth in the retail sector may strain relations with certain of our distribution customers who also compete in the retail pharmacy sector. there can be no assurance that our retail locations will be received as well as, or achieve net sales or profitability levels consistent with, our projected targets or be comparable to those of our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us, or at all. if our retail expansion fails to achieve, or is unable to sustain, acceptable net sales and profitability levels, our business, results of operations and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected. our retail stores may require additional management time and attention. failure to properly supervise the operation and maintain the consistency of the customer experience in those retail stores could result in loss of customers and potentially adversely affect our results of operations. we may be unable to keep existing retail store locations or open new retail locations in desirable places, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. we may be unable to keep existing retail locations or open new retail locations in desirable places in the future. we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable retail locations. local land use, local zoning issues, environmental regulations and other regulations may affect our ability to find suitable retail locations and also influence the cost of leasing or buying them. we also may have difficulty negotiating real estate leases for new stores, renewing real estate leases for existing stores or negotiating purchase agreements for new sites on acceptable terms. in addition, construction, environmental, zoning and real estate delays may negatively affect retail location openings and increase costs and capital expenditures. if we are unable to keep up our existing retail store locations or open new retail store locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk: our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. at march 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion and in cash and cash equivalents. the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2019 and 2018 of approximately $4 million and $10 million. foreign exchange risk: we conduct our business worldwide in u.s. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including euro, british pound sterling and canadian dollars. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in u.s. dollars. we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. we have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. the forward contracts and cross-currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk. as of march 31, 2019 and 2018, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $581 million and $458 million. however, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. refer to financial note 20, hedging activities, for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. 49 table of contents mckesson corporationrisk factors the discussion below identifies certain representative risks that might cause our actual business results to materially differ from our estimates. it is not practical to identify or describe all risks and uncertainties that might materially impact our business operations, reputation, financial position or results of operations. our business could be materially affected by risks that we have not yet identified or that we currently consider to be immaterial. this is not a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. litigation and regulatory risks we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes. we are routinely named as a defendant in litigation or regulatory proceedings and other legal disputes, which may include asserted class action litigation, such as those described in financial note 21 , commitments and contingent liabilities , to the consolidated financial statements in this report. regulatory proceedings might involve allegations such as false claims, healthcare fraud and abuse, and antitrust violations. civil litigation proceedings might involve commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, tort and other claims. despite valid defenses that we assert, legal disputes are often costly, time-consuming, distracting to management and disruptive to normal business operations. the outcome of legal disputes is difficult to predict. outcomes can occur that are not justified by the evidence or existing law. the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal disputes might harm our business and reputation even if the matter is favorably resolved. accordingly, any legal dispute might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might experience losses not covered by insurance. our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. for example, pharmacy operations are exposed to risks such as improper filling of prescriptions, mislabeling of prescriptions, inadequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. although we seek to maintain adequate insurance coverage, such as property insurance for inventory and professional and general liability insurance, coverages on acceptable terms might be unavailable, or coverages might not cover our losses. we generally seek to limit our contractual exposure, but limitations of liability or indemnity provisions in our contracts may not be enforceable or adequately protect us from liability. uninsured losses might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we experience costly legal disputes, government actions and adverse publicity regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids. the company is a defendant in over 3,000 cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances (opioids), as described in financial note 21 , commitments and contingent liabilities , to the consolidated financial statements in this report. we regularly are named as a defendant in similar, new cases. the plaintiffs in those cases include governmental entities (such as states, provinces, counties and municipalities) as well as businesses, groups and individuals. the cases allege violations of controlled substance laws and other laws, and they make common law claims such as negligence and public nuisance. many of these cases raise novel theories of liability. any proceedings can have unexpected outcomes that are not justified by evidence or existing law. all proceedings involve significant expense, management time and distraction, and risk of loss that can be difficult to predict or quantify. it is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. proceedings can result in monetary damages, penalties and fines, and injunctive or other relief. although the company has valid defenses and is vigorously defending itself, some proceedings are resolved by negotiated outcome. our reputation is impacted by publicity regarding the impacts of opioid use. the adverse outcome of legal proceedings might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might experience increased costs to distribute controlled substances such as opioids. legislative, regulatory or industry measures related to the distribution of controlled substances such as prescription opioids could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict. for example, some states have passed legislation that could require us to pay taxes or assessments on the distribution of opioid medications in those states and other states have considered similar legislation. liabilities for taxes or assessments or other costs of compliance under any such laws might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. 10 table of contents mckesson corporation we are subject to extensive, complex and challenging healthcare and other laws. our industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations. for example, we are subject to many environmental and hazardous materials regulations, including those relating to radiation-emitting equipment operated at u.s. oncology network practices. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse. local, state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose many restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid. many of these laws, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. the laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. failures to comply with applicable laws subject us to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions, and to liability for damages and civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. these sanctions might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might lose our ability to purchase, compound, store or distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration ( dea ), the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, hhs, the centers for medicare &amp; medicaid services ( cms ) and other comparable agencies. certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the dea, fda, hhs, cms, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. for example, we are required to hold valid dea and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, distribution, and disposal of controlled substances. noncompliance with these requirements has resulted in monetary penalties and/or licensing sanctions. for example, under a january 2017 agreement with the dea and department of justice we paid $150 million to settle potential administrative and civil claims about our practices for reporting suspicious orders of controlled substances and the dea suspended, on a staggered basis for limited periods of time, our registrations to distribute certain controlled substances from four distribution centers. as of march 31, 2020, one dea registration was in suspension, and three were expired. if we are not able to obtain, maintain or renew permits, licenses or other regulatory approvals needed for the operation of our businesses, it might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. pedigree tracking laws increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs. there have been increasing efforts by governments to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, otherwise known as pedigree tracking. for example, the u.s. drug quality and security act of 2013 ( dqsa ) requires us to participate in a federal prescription drug track and trace system that preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and the u.s. food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies, such as track and trace or authentication technologies, to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. we also have record-keeping and other obligations under the e.u. falsified medicines directive. pedigree tracking laws such as these increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs, and they might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. 11 table of contents mckesson corporation privacy and data protection laws increase our compliance burden. we are subject to a variety of privacy and data protection laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. for example, under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) we must maintain administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect individually identifiable health information ( protected health information ) and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. we are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the general data protection regulation in the european union ( gdpr ), the personal information protection and electronic documents act ( pipeda ) in canada, and the california consumer protection act ( ccpa ). some privacy laws prohibit the transfer of personal information to certain other jurisdictions. we are subject to privacy and data protection compliance audits or investigations by various government agencies. failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity, fines, private litigation including class actions, and other costs. we also have contractual obligations to customers that might be breached if we fail to comply with privacy laws. our efforts to comply with privacy laws complicates our operations and adds to our compliance costs. a significant privacy breach or failure to comply with privacy laws might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, business operations and our financial position or results of operations. anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws increase our compliance burden. we are subject to laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. the u.k. bribery act, for example, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the u.k. bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. our failure to comply with these laws might subject us to civil and criminal penalties that might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. company and operational risks we might record significant charges from impairment to goodwill, intangibles and other assets or investments. we are required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a divestiture, indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of a significant customer, burdensome new laws or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value. there are inherent uncertainties in management's estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, a deterioration in the u.s. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. for example, the covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and exacerbated uncertainties inherent in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in our forecasts and impairment assessments. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible and other long-lived assets is determined, which might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. 12 table of contents mckesson corporation we experience cybersecurity incidents and might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches. we and our external service providers use sophisticated computer systems to perform our business operations, such as the secure electronic transmission, processing, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information and other types of personal information, confidential financial information, proprietary information, and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. many of these systems have experienced and are subject to cybersecurity incidents, despite physical, technical and administrative security measures. cyber incidents include actual or attempted unauthorized access, tampering, malware insertion, ransomware attacks or other system integrity events. the risk of cyber incidents may be increased while many of our personnel are working remotely due to the covid-19 pandemic. a cybersecurity incident might involve a material data breach or other material impact to the integrity and operations of these computer systems, which might result in litigation or regulatory action, loss of customers or revenue, increased expense, any of which might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations, reputation and our financial position or results of operations. we might experience significant problems with information systems or networks. we rely on sophisticated information systems and networks to perform our business operations, such as to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data that facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from distribution centers. our dependence on network availability is increased while many of our personnel are working remotely due to the covid-19 pandemic. if those information systems are unsuccessfully implemented, fail, suffer errors or interruptions, or become unavailable, it might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. our products or services might not conform to specifications or perform as we intend. we sell and provide services involving complex software and technology that may contain errors, especially when first introduced to market. healthcare professionals delivering patient care tend to have heightened sensitivity to system and software errors. if our software and technology services are alleged to have contributed to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we might be subject to claims or litigation by users of or software or services or their patients. errors or failures might damage our reputation and negatively affect future sales. a failure of a system or software to conform to specifications might constitute a breach of warranty that could result in repair costs, contract termination, refunds of amounts previously paid or claims for damages. any of these types of errors or failures might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might be impeded in providing customers online services and data access. we provide remote services that involve hosting customer data and operating software on our own or third party systems. our customers rely on their ability to access the systems and their data as needed. the networks and hosting systems are vulnerable to interruption or damage from sources beyond our control, such as power loss, telecommunications failures, fire, natural disasters, software and hardware failures and cyberattacks. if the timely delivery of medical care or other customer business requirements are impaired by data access, network or systems problems, we could be exposed to significant claims and reputational harm. any such problems might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might not realize expected benefits from business process initiatives. we may implement restructuring, cost reduction or other business process initiatives that might result in extraordinary charges and expenses, failures to achieve our desired objectives, or unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity. any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. 13 table of contents mckesson corporation we might be unable to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions or other business combinations. our growth strategy includes consummating acquisitions or other business combinations that either expand or complement our business. to fund acquisitions, we may require financing that may not be available on acceptable terms. we may not receive regulatory approvals needed to complete proposed transactions, or such approvals may be subject to delays or conditions that reduce transaction benefits. achieving the desired outcomes of business combinations involves significant risks including: diverting management's attention from other business operations; challenges with assimilating the acquired businesses, such as integration of operations and systems; failure or delay in realizing operating synergies; difficulty retaining key acquired company personnel; unanticipated accounting or financial systems issues with the acquired business, which might affect our internal controls over financial reporting; unanticipated compliance issues in the acquired business; challenges retaining customers of the acquired business; unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings, including depreciation and amortization or potential impairment charges; and risks of known and unknown assumed liabilities in the acquired business. any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might be adversely impacted by delays or other difficulties with divestitures. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. after the disposition, we might experience greater dissynergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue or profit might be larger than we expected. we might have difficulties with pre-closing conditions such as regulatory and governmental approvals, which could delay or prevent the divestiture. we might have financial exposure in a divested business, such as through minority equity ownership, financial or performance guarantees, indemnities or other obligations, such that conditions outside of our control might negate the expected benefits of the disposition. any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of a divestiture and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might not realize the expected tax treatment from our split-off of change healthcare. on march 10, 2020, the company completed a separation of its interest in change healthcare llc ( change healthcare jv ). the divestiture was effected through the split-off of pf2 spinco, inc. ( spinco ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that held all of the company's interest in the change healthcare jv, to certain of the company's stockholders through an exchange offer (the exchange offer ), followed by a merger of spinco with and into change healthcare inc. ( change ), with change surviving the merger (the merger and, together with the exchange offer, the transactions ). the company received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that the transactions qualified as generally tax-free transactions to the company and its shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes. an opinion of legal counsel is not binding on the internal revenue service (the irs ) or the courts, and the irs or the courts may not agree with the intended tax-free treatment of the transactions. in addition, the opinion could not be relied upon if certain assumptions, representations and undertakings upon which the opinion was based are materially inaccurate or incomplete, or are violated in any material respect. if the intended tax-free treatment of the transactions is not sustained, the company and its stockholders who participated in the transactions may be required to pay substantial u.s. federal income taxes. in connection with the transactions, the company, spinco, change and the change healthcare jv entered into the tax matters agreement, which governs their respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding u.s. federal, state and local, and non-u.s. taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. under the tax matters agreement, change is required to indemnify the company if the transactions become taxable as a result of certain actions by change or spinco, or as a result of certain changes in ownership of the stock of change after the merger. if change does not honor its obligations to indemnify the company, or if the transactions fail to qualify for the intended tax-free treatment for reasons not related to a disqualifying action by change or spinco, the resulting tax to the company could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. we might be adversely impacted by outsourcing or similar third-party relationships. we rely on third parties to perform certain business and administrative functions for us. we might not adequately develop, implement and monitor these outsourced service providers, and we might not realize expected cost savings or other benefits. third-party services providers might fail to perform as anticipated, or we might experience unanticipated operational difficulties, compliance requirements or increased costs related to outsourced services. for example, our ability to use outsourcing resources in certain jurisdictions might be limited by legislative action or customer contracts, with the result that the work must be performed at greater expense or we may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance. any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. 14 table of contents mckesson corporation we may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy operations or maintaining profitability. our business strategy included expanding our retail pharmacy operations. our retail pharmacy operations involve numerous risks, such as the following ones. we might encounter difficulties attracting and retaining customers to our retail locations due to their unfamiliarity with our brands or our inexperience with local market preferences. competition from our retail pharmacy operations might strain relationships with our retail pharmacy customers. consolidation of retail pharmacies with third party payers, expansion of large retail pharmacy networks, reductions in reimbursement rates, shifts in the mix of branded and generic pharmaceutical sales, and exclusion from preferred pharmacy networks can impair our retail pharmacy sales and profitability. failure to maintain profitable retail pharmacy operations may result in significant costs, including those associated with site closures and reductions in workforce. if our retail pharmacy operations fail to achieve, or are unable to sustain, acceptable net sales and profitability levels, it might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-renewal. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from, and have a significant portion of our accounts receivable with, a small number of customers. at march 31, 2020, sales to our largest customer represented approximately 20% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 20% of our trade receivables, and those of our ten largest customers combined accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 37% of our trade receivables. a material default in payment, reduction in purchases, or the loss of business from a large customer might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. our contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks. our contracts with government entities are subject to risks such as lack of funding and legal compliance. for example, government contract purchase obligations are typically subject to the availability of funding, which may be eliminated. our government contracts might not be renewed or might be terminated for convenience with little or no prior notice. government contracts typically expose us to higher potential liability than do other types of contracts. in addition, government contracts typically are subject to procurement laws that include socio-economic, employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting and other requirements. for example, our contracts with the u.s. government generally require us to comply with the federal acquisition regulations, u.s. false claims act, procurement integrity act, buy american act and trade agreements act. we are subject to government audits, investigations and oversight proceedings. government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether they are complying with contractual and legal requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, or we fail an audit, we are subject to various sanctions such as monetary damages, criminal and civil penalties, termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contract work. these requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden. the occurrence of any of these risks could harm our reputation and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might be harmed by changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers. we attempt to structure our pharmaceutical distribution agreements with manufacturers to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide. certain distribution agreements with manufacturers include pharmaceutical price inflation as a component of our compensation, and we cannot control the frequency or magnitude of pharmaceutical price changes. we might be unable to renew pharmaceutical distribution agreements with manufacturers in a timely and favorable manner. any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. 15 table of contents mckesson corporation we might infringe intellectual property rights or our intellectual property protections might be inadequate. we believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, but third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and may do so in the future. if a court were to hold that we infringed other's rights, we might be required to pay substantial damages, develop non-infringing products or services, obtain a license, stop selling or using the infringing products or services, or incur other sanctions. we rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure obligations and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. we might initiate costly and time-consuming litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. our intellectual property protection efforts might be inadequate to protect our rights. our competitors might develop non-infringing products or services equivalent or superior to ours. any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might be unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified employees. our ability to attract, engage, develop and retain qualified and experienced employees, including key executives and other talent, is essential for us to meet our objectives. we compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees. competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries, benefits or other employee-related costs, or in our failure to recruit and retain employees. we may experience sudden loss of key personnel due to a variety of causes, such as illness, and must adequately plan for succession of key management roles. employees might not successfully transition into new roles. any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. industry and economic risks we might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement models. many of our products and services are designed and intended to function within the structure of current healthcare financing and reimbursement systems. the healthcare industry and related government programs are changing significantly as they seek to increase efficiencies, reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. these changes increase our risks and create uncertainties for our business. for example, reimbursement methodologies (including government rates) for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services reduce profit margins for us and our customers and impose new legal requirements on healthcare providers. changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, changes in the basis for payments, shifting away from fee-for-service and towards value-based payments and risk-sharing models, and increases in the use of managed care. in the u.s., the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ) significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. there are continued efforts to challenge the aca. there are also efforts to broaden healthcare coverage. u.s. lawmakers also have explored proposals to reduce drug prices, including requiring price transparency and drug importation measures. these proposals might result in significant changes in the pharmaceutical value chain as manufacturers, pbm, managed care organizations and other industry stakeholders look to implement new transactional flows and adapt their business models. provincial governments in canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. for example, provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers. many european governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels in order to control government healthcare system costs. some european governments have implemented or are considering austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending. these measures exert pressure on the pricing and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services or influence us to reduce prices. although there is substantial uncertainty about the likelihood, timing and results of these health reform efforts, their implementation might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. 16 table of contents mckesson corporation we might be adversely impacted by competition and industry consolidation. our businesses face a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. in addition, our businesses face competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that might otherwise be provided by our businesses. due to consolidation, a few large suppliers control a significant share of the pharmaceuticals market. this concentration reduces our ability to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers and causes us to depend on a smaller number of suppliers. many of our customers, including healthcare organizations, have consolidated and have greater power to negotiate favorable prices. consolidation by our customers, suppliers and competitors might reduce the number of market participants and give the remaining enterprises greater bargaining power, which might lead to erosion in our profit margin. consolidation might increase counter-party credit risk because credit purchases increase for fewer market participants. these competitive pressures and industry consolidation might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might be adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply. our supply arrangements might be interrupted or adversely affected by a variety of causes over which we have no control, such as export controls or trade sanctions, labor disputes, unavailability of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure raw materials, quality control concerns, ethical sourcing issues, supplier's financial distress, natural disasters, civil unrest or acts of war. our inventory might be requisitioned, diverted or allocated by government order such as under emergency, disaster and civil defense declarations. for example, government actions in response to the covid-19 pandemic affect our supply allocation, and those and our own allocation decisions can impact our customer relationships. changes in the healthcare industry's or our suppliers' pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. we might experience disruptions in our supply of higher margin pharmaceuticals, including generic pharmaceuticals. any of these changes or disruptions might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might be adversely impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals. our generic pharmaceuticals distribution business is subject to pricing risks. we might be adversely impacted if our clarusone generic pharmaceutical sourcing joint venture with walmart, inc. is unsuccessful or experiences margins declines. generic drug manufacturers often offer a generic version of branded pharmaceuticals while they challenge the validity or enforceability branded pharmaceutical patents. the patent holder might assert infringement claims against us for distributing those generic versions and the generic drug manufactures may not fully indemnify us against such claims. these risks, as well as changes in the availability, pricing volatility, reimbursement rates for generic drugs, or significant changes in the nature, frequency or magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches, might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might be adversely impacted by an economic slowdown or recession. an economic slowdown or recession affecting our businesses in one or more regions could reduce the prices our customers are able or willing to pay for our products and services and the volume of their purchases. this risk is increased by the covid-19 pandemic. any economic slowdown or recession might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. 17 table of contents mckesson corporation disruption or other changes in capital and credit markets might impede access to credit and increase borrowing costs for us and our customers and suppliers and might impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by financial institutions, or decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market, might adversely affect our borrowing ability and cost of borrowing. we generally sell our products and services under short-term unsecured credit arrangements. an adverse change in general economic conditions or access to capital might cause our customers to reduce their purchases from us, or delay or fail paying amounts owed to us. suppliers might increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale due to limited availability of credit. suppliers might be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. these risks are increased by the covid-19 pandemic. interest rate increases or changes in capital market conditions might impede our or our customers' or suppliers' ability or cost to obtain credit. for example, interest rate costs on types of borrowings that have historically been linked to the london inter-bank offered rate ( libor ) may increase when libor is replaced by reference rates such as the secured overnight financing rate ( sofr ). any of these risks might have a material adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we may have difficulties in sourcing or selling products due to a variety of causes. we might experience difficulties and delays in sourcing and selling products due to a variety of causes, such as: difficulties in complying with the legal requirements for export or import of pharmaceuticals or components; suppliers' failure to satisfy production demand; manufacturing or supply problems such as inadequate resources; and real or perceived quality issues. difficulties in product manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in supplier production shutdowns, product shortages and other supply disruptions. the fda banned certain manufacturers from selling raw materials and drug ingredients in the u.s. due to quality issues. the covid-19 pandemic adversely affects the availability of some products, resulting in product allocation and delivery delays. any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might be adversely impacted by tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions. we are subject to the tax laws in the united states at the federal, state and local government levels and to the tax laws of many other jurisdictions in which we operate or sell products or services. tax laws might change in ways that adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate and cash flow. the tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. we are subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions that might assess additional tax liabilities against us. our tax reporting positions might be challenged by relevant tax authorities, we might incur significant expense in our efforts to defend those challenges, and we might be unsuccessful those efforts. developments in examinations and challenges might materially change our provision for taxes in the affected periods and might differ materially from our historical tax accruals. any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations, our cash flows and our financial position or results of operations we might be adversely impacted by the brexit withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union. we have operations in the u.k. and the european union ( e.u. ) and face risks associated with the uncertainty and potential disruptions that might follow the united kingdom withdrawing from the european union ( brexit ). brexit could adversely affect political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. for example, we might experience volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and changes in laws regulating our u.k. operations. customers might reduce purchases due to the uncertainty caused by brexit. any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we conduct our business in various currencies, including the u.s. dollar, euro, british pound sterling and canadian dollar. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our revenues, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results reported in u.s. dollars. for example, we are exposed to transactional currency exchange risk due to our import and export of products that are purchased or sold in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we also have currency exchange risk due to intercompany loans denominated in various currencies. the covid-19 pandemic has affected and might increase currency exchange rate volatility. we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts, foreign currency borrowings or other techniques intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks. these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place. any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. 18 table of contents mckesson corporation other risks we might be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues, natural disasters, political events and other catastrophic events. we might be adversely affected by events outside of our control, including: widespread public health issues, such as epidemic or pandemic infectious diseases; natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes or floods; political events such as terrorism, military conflicts and trade wars; and other catastrophic events. these events might disrupt operations for us, our suppliers and our customers. they might affect consumer confidence levels and spending. in response to these events, we might suspend operations, implement extraordinary procedures, seek alternate sources for product supply, or suffer consequences that are unexpected and difficult to mitigate. in particular, the rapid and widespread transmission of the sars-cov-2 novel coronavirus beginning in late 2019 impacts us in significant ways. for example, to mitigate the spread of the covid-19 disease caused by sars-cov-2, we implemented travel restrictions and remote working arrangements for most of our employees in order to minimize physical contact, and we implemented additional sanitation and personal protection measures in our warehouse, retail pharmacy and delivery operations. these measures might not fully mitigate covid-19 risks to our workforce and we could experience unusual levels of absenteeism that might impair operations and delay delivery of products. the covid-19 pandemic affects product manufacturing, supply and transport availability and cost. the pandemic reduces demand for some products due to delays or cancellations of elective medical procedures, consumer self-isolation and business closures, among other reasons. the covid-19 pandemic influences shortages of some products, with product allocation resulting in delivery delays for customers. the ongoing impacts of the pandemic might cause a general economic slowdown or recession in one or more markets, disruptions and volatility in global capital markets and other broad and adverse effects on the economy, business conditions, commercial activity and the healthcare industry. the pandemic might impact our business operation, financial position and results of operation in unpredictable ways that depend on highly-uncertain future developments, such as determining the effectiveness of current or future government actions to address the public health or economic impacts of the pandemic. any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. we might be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards. our consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which periodically is revised or reinterpreted. from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards may require changes to the accounting treatment in our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our financial systems. such changes might have a materially adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk: our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. at march 31, 2020 and 2019 , we had $4.0 billion and $3.0 billion and in cash and cash equivalents. the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2020 and 2019 of approximately $6.0 million and $4.0 million . foreign exchange risk: we conduct our business worldwide in u.s. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including euro, british pound sterling and canadian dollars. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in u.s. dollars. we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. we have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. the forward contracts and cross-currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. these programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk. as of march 31, 2020 and 2019 , the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $435 million and $581 million . however, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. refer to financial note 18 , hedging activities , for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. 49 table of contents mckesson corporationrisk factors the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. we are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. from time-to-time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving antitrust, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, tort and other various claims. all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. future court decisions and legislative activity may increase the company exposure to litigation and regulatory investigations. in some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. for some complaints filed against the company, we are currently unable to estimate the remaining amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company. 11 table of contents mckesson corporation the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. for example, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings described in financial note 18, other commitments and contingent liabilities, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements which could have such an impact, including class actions and other legal proceedings alleging that we engaged in illegal conduct that caused average wholesale prices to rise for certain prescription drugs during specified periods. litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation. for additional information regarding certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved, see financial note 18, other commitments and contingent liabilities, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. changes in the united states healthcare environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. these changes include increased use of managed care, cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. some of these changes, such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services, legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information or the delivery or pricing of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to greatly reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. changes in the healthcare industry or our pharmaceutical suppliers pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices, or changes in our customer mix could also significantly reduce our revenues and net income. due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services. the majority of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide; however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. generic pharmaceuticals: healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents. in recent years, our financial results have improved from our generic drug offering programs. an increase or a decrease in the availability or changes in pricing or reimbursement of these generic drugs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. during the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product patent. to the extent we source and distribute such generic products launched at risk, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us. while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us. 12 table of contents mckesson corporation international sourcing: we may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including, but not limited to, (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities, (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements or physical limitations that could impact continuous supply and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. manufacturing difficulties could result in manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages and delays in product manufacturing. pedigree tracking: there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and comparable government agencies, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system ( pedigree tracking ). certain states have adopted or are considering laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations. florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using radio frequency tagging and electronic pedigrees, which will be effective for us in july 2016. final regulations under the federal prescription drug marketing act requiring pedigree and chain of custody tracking in certain circumstances became effective december 1, 2006. this latter regulation has been challenged in a case brought by secondary distributors. a preliminary injunction was issued by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york that temporarily enjoined implementation of this regulation. this injunction was affirmed by the court of appeals for the second circuit in july 2008. in december 2008, both parties agreed to delay this litigation, pending the outcome of certain u.s. congressional legislative initiatives. in addition, the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) amendments act of 2007, which went into effect on october 1, 2007, requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include any track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies. on march 26, 2010, the fda released the serialized numerical identifier ( sni ) guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging. we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations. nonetheless, these pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. healthcare fraud: we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud. the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. furthermore, our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs, (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to a federal health care program such as medicare and medicaid. legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse. many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. 13 table of contents mckesson corporation claims transmissions: medical billing and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws that pertain to companies that provide billing and collection services or that provide consulting services in connection with billing and collection activities. in connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payors may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare, medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. e-prescribing: the use of our solutions by physicians for electronic prescribing, electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and dispensing is governed by federal and state law. states have differing prescription format requirements, which we have programmed into our software. in addition, in november 2005, the u.s. department of health and human services (the hhs ) announced regulations by the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) related to e-prescribing and the prescription drug program ( e-prescribing regulations ). these e-prescribing regulations were mandated by the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003. the e-prescribing regulations set forth standards for the transmission of electronic prescriptions. these standards are detailed and significant and cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility, benefits inquiries, drug formulary and benefit coverage information. our efforts to provide solutions that enable our clients to comply with these regulations could be time consuming and expensive. reimbursements: both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. for example, the deficit reduction act of 2005 ( dra ) was intended to reduce net medicare and medicaid spending by approximately $11 billion over five years. effective january 1, 2007, the dra changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from 150% of the lowest published price for generic pharmaceuticals (which is usually the average wholesale price) to 250% of the lowest average manufacturer price ( amp ). on july 17, 2007, cms published a final rule implementing these provisions and clarifying, among other things, the amp calculation methodology and the dra provision requiring manufacturers to publicly report amp for branded and generic pharmaceuticals. on december 19, 2007, the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting use of the amp calculation in connection with medicaid reimbursement pending resolution of a lawsuit claiming that cms had acted unlawfully in adopting the rule. on july 15, 2008, the u.s. congress enacted the medicaid improvements for patients and providers acts of 2008 ( mippa, ) which delayed the adoption of cms final rule and prevented cms from publishing amp data until october 1, 2009. in addition, medicare, medicaid and the schip extension act of 2007 require cms to adjust the calculation of the medicare part b drug average sales price ( asp ) to an actual sales volume basis. we expect that the use of an amp benchmark and the revised asp calculations would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals, which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability. there can be no assurance that the changes under the dra would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. interoperability standards: there is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other. this need for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups. the certification commission for healthcare information technology ( cchit ) has developed a set of criteria defining levels of interoperability, functionality and security for the industry, which are still being modified and refined. various federal, state and foreign government agencies are also developing standards that could become mandatory for systems purchased by these agencies. for example, the health information technology for economic and clinical health (hitech) act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ) of 2009 requires meaningful use of certified healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government. we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions if we need to upgrade our software and systems to be in compliance with these varying and evolving standards. in addition, these changes may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. delays in achieving certification under these evolving standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers decisions to purchase our products. 14 table of contents mckesson corporation healthcare industry consolidation: in recent years, the pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation. as a result, a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market. accordingly, we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and we are less able to negotiate price terms with the suppliers. many healthcare organizations have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power. if this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the size of our target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services. in addition, when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems and acquisition of our clients could erode our revenue base. our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad. public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers. we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations and will continue to update these plans as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company operating results. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. changes in the canadian healthcare environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. similar to the united states, the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years to reduce costs. the provincial governments provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the financing and reimbursement of drugs. the ontario government revised the drug distribution system in 2006 with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act and has recently announced a review of that legislation in an attempt to further reduce costs. some of the changes being considered would adversely affect the distribution of drugs, pricing for prescription drugs and reduced funding for healthcare services. other provinces are considering similar changes, which would lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. such changes could significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit. competition may erode our profit. in every area of healthcare distribution operations, our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition, both in price and service, from national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution and large payor organizations. in addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers (as well as other potential customers of the segment) which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. price, quality of service, and in some cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment. our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payors, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 15 table of contents mckesson corporation our distribution solutions segment is subject to inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices, which subjects us to risks and uncertainties. inflation can be the partial basis of some of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, we also distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price deflation. an acceleration of the frequency or size of generic price decreases could also have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. substantial defaults in payment, a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. in recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers. during 2010, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 53% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our two largest customers, cvs and rite aid, represented approximately 15% and 12% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2010, accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 45% of total accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs and rite aid were approximately 14% and 10% of total accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations ( gpos ), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers. a default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we generally sell product to our customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured. any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which would reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability and cash flow. further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which would reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. our distribution solutions segment is dependent upon sophisticated information systems. the implementation delay, malfunction, or failure of these systems for any extended period of time could have a material adverse impact on our business. we rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to, (1) facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers, (2) receive, process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis, (3) manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and (4) process payments to suppliers. if these systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time, we could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. reduced capacity in the commercial property insurance market exposes us to potential loss. in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. one or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 16 table of contents mckesson corporation we could become subject to liability claims that are not adequately covered by our insurance and may have to pay damages and other expenses which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payor businesses (which include disease management programs and our nurse triage services) and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. if customers assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. we also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. in addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations. our healthcare technology businesses, the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment, deliver enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, strategic management software solutions and pharmacy automation to hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail and mail order pharmacies and payors. challenges in integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment. future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses. such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete. the success of our technology businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to be responsive to technological developments, legislative initiatives, pricing pressures and changing business models. to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace, our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis. the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers and thereby could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the loss of third party licenses utilized by our technology businesses may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we license the rights to use certain technologies from third-party vendors to incorporate in or complement our various healthcare technology products and solutions, which are primarily offered through our technology solutions segment. these licenses are generally nonexclusive, must be renewed periodically by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license. as a result, we may have to discontinue, delay or reduce product shipments until we obtain equivalent technology, which could hurt our business. our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with us. in addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future, we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products. 17 table of contents mckesson corporation proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties. we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. in addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. although we believe that our products do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time-to-time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. if we were found to be infringing others rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing technology. additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. these litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the software and software systems ( systems ) that we sell or operate are very complex. as with complex systems offered by others, our systems may contain errors, especially when first introduced. for example, our technology solutions segment business systems are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care. therefore, users of our systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. if our software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients, clinicians or patients. in addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales. failure of a client system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages. various risks could interrupt customers access to their data residing in our service center, exposing us to significant costs. we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers. the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers. our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation, (1) power loss and telecommunications failures, (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters, (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes and (4) computer viruses, hacking and similar disruptive problems. we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change control and system security measures, but our precautions may not protect against all problems. if customers access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services. 18 table of contents mckesson corporation regulation of our distribution businesses and regulation of our computer-related products could impose increased costs, delay the introduction of new products and negatively impact our business. the healthcare industry is highly regulated. we are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration (the dea ), the fda, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the hhs, cms and other comparable agencies. certain of our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of the dea, the fda, hhs, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. in addition, the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of computer products and computer-assisted products as medical devices under the federal food, drug and cosmetic act. if the fda chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the fda could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. any final fda policy governing computer products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products. we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. although we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. regulations relating to confidentiality of sensitive personal information and to format and data content standards could depress the demand for our products and impose significant product redesign costs and unforeseen liabilities on us. state, federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released. these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified security measures. regulations currently in place, including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. although our systems are being updated and modified to comply with the current requirements of state and foreign laws and the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and the hitech act, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in february 2010, certain provisions of the federal security and privacy standards have been extended to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payor and provider customers. furthermore, failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. 19 table of contents mckesson corporation the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles, which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation. how and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer. recent legislation that provides incentives to purchase health information systems imposes strict conditions on these incentives, including the requirement that purchased systems must comply with applicable federally-endorsed standards. to the extent these standards are narrowly construed or delayed in publication, our customers may delay or cancel their purchase decisions. any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. we are required under u. s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) to test our goodwill for impairment, annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the company stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates and the loss of a significant customer. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. there are inherent uncertainties in management estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. our foreign operations may subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we have operations based in foreign countries, including canada, the united kingdom, other european countries, asia pacific and israel and we have a large investment in mexico. in the future, we look to continue to grow our foreign operations both organically and through acquisitions and investments; however, increasing our foreign operations carries additional risks. operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; import/export regulations in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. political changes and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. additionally, foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar. foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 20 table of contents mckesson corporation tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. from time-to-time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. in addition, united states federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully. an element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses and a potential material adverse impact on operating results. in addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable. if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. continued volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements. although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. our $1.1 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will expire in mid-may 2010. although we did not use this facility in 2010, we have historically used it to fund working capital requirements, as needed. we anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration. if our use of the current accounts receivable sales facility is characterized as a secured borrowing rather than a sale for u.s. gaap purposes under accounting pronouncements that will become effective for us in 2011, we may be required to consider the funds obtained by us under this facility and the related liens in the covenant compliance calculations for certain of our other financing arrangements. although we believe we will be able to renew this facility, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. additionally, if customers or suppliers operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. 21 table of contents mckesson corporation changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements. our financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time-to-time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk: our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by 50 bp in 2010, interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported. our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. should interest rates decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2010, interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $16 million. as of march 31, 2010 and 2009, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $2,548 million and $2,545 million. the estimated fair value of our long-term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms. foreign exchange risk: we derive revenues and earnings from canada, the united kingdom, ireland, other european countries, israel, asia pacific and mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. as of march 31, 2010, an adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk. 49 table of contents mckesson corporationrisk factors the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. we are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. from time-to-time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving antitrust, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, tort and other various claims. all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. in some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. for some complaints filed against the company, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company. the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. for example, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings described in financial note 17, other commitments and contingent liabilities, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements that could have such an impact, including class actions and other legal proceedings alleging that we engaged in illegal conduct that caused average wholesale prices to rise for certain prescription drugs during specified periods. litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation. for additional information regarding certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved, see financial note 17, other commitments and contingent liabilities, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 11 table of contents mckesson corporation changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. these changes have included increased use of managed care, cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future. changes in the healthcare industry or our pharmaceutical suppliers pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services. the majority of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide; however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, branded price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, we also distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation. healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents. in recent years, our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings. an increase or a decrease in the availability or changes in pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. during the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product patent. to the extent we source and distribute such generic products launched at risk, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us. while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us. in recent years, the pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation. as a result, a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market. accordingly, we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers. many healthcare organizations also have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power. if this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the size of our target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services. in addition, when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems, which in turn may erode our customer and revenue base. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses and computer-related products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations. 12 table of contents mckesson corporation healthcare fraud: we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, and the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs, (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs, and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to a federal health care program such as medicare and medicaid. many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. reimbursements: both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. for example, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act (collectively the affordable care act ), signed into law in 2010, revised the federal upper limits for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175% of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price ( amp ) using a smoothing process. in addition, medicare, medicaid and the state children health insurance program ( schip ) extension act of 2007 requires the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) to adjust the calculation of the medicare part b drug average sales price ( asp ) to an actual sales volume basis. we expect that the use of an amp benchmark and the revised asp calculations would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals, which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability. there can be no assurance that these changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. operating, security and licensure standards: we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration (the dea ), the food and drug administration ( fda ), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ), the cms and other comparable agencies. certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of the dea, fda, hhs, cms, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. as part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. pedigree tracking: there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and comparable government agencies, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system ( pedigree tracking ). certain states have adopted or are considering laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system, while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations. for example, florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using radio frequency tagging and electronic pedigrees, which will be effective for us in july 2016. 13 table of contents mckesson corporation final regulations under the federal prescription drug marketing act requiring pedigree and chain of custody tracking in certain circumstances became effective december 1, 2006. this latter regulation has been challenged in a case brought by secondary distributors. a preliminary injunction was issued by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york that temporarily enjoined implementation of this regulation. this injunction was affirmed by the court of appeals for the second circuit in july 2008. in december 2008, both parties agreed to delay this litigation, pending the outcome of certain u.s. congressional legislative initiatives. in addition, the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 ( fdaa ), which went into effect on october 1, 2007, requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include any track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies. on march 26, 2010, the fda released the serialized numerical identifier ( sni ) guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging. we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations. nonetheless, these pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. privacy: state, federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released. these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures. regulations currently in place, including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. although our policies, procedures and systems are being updated and modified to comply with the current requirements of applicable state and foreign laws, including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and the health information technology for economic and clinical health ( hitech ) act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ) of 2009, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or it could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations. it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customers. these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations. furthermore, failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. health care reform : the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers. further federal and state proposals for healthcare reform are likely. while we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act will have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, given the scope of the changes made and the uncertainties associated with the its implementation, we cannot predict its full impact on the company at this time. interoperability standards: there is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other. this need for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups, and certain federal and state agencies are also developing standards that could become mandatory for systems purchased by these agencies. for example, the hitech act requires meaningful use of certified healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government. effective september 27, 2010, cms issued a rule that utilizes a staged approach for defining meaningful use criteria. in stage 1, cms defined the initial criteria for meaningful use, and has stated that it intends to update these initial criteria with additional stage 2 criteria by the end of calendar 2011, and with additional stage 3 criteria by the end of calendar 2013. we may incur increased development costs and delays in upgrading our customer software and systems to be in compliance with these varying and evolving standards. in addition, these new standards may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. to the extent these standards are narrowly construed or delayed in publication, or that we are delayed in achieving certification under these evolving standards for applicable products, our customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement our software and systems. 14 table of contents mckesson corporation fda regulation of computer products : the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of computer products and computer-assisted products as medical devices under the federal food, drug and cosmetic act. for example, effective april 18, 2011, the fda issued a new rule regulating certain computer data systems as medical devices. if the fda chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the fda could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. any additional fda regulations governing computer products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products. standards for submission of health care claims : hhs has adopted two new rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement. in the first rule, effective january 1, 2012, hhs has modified the standards for electronic health care transactions ( e.g. , eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from version 4010/4010a to version 5010. in the second rule, effective october 1, 2013, hhs has updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases, ninth revision ( icd-9 ) to international classification of diseases, tenth revision ( icd-10 ). updating systems to version 5010 is required for use of the icd-10 code set. generally, claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd-10 when required will not be processed, and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd-10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries. we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new standards. in addition, these standards may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers decisions to purchase our software and systems. claims transmissions: medical billing and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws that pertain to companies that provide billing and collection services, or that provide consulting services in connection with billing and collection activities. in connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare, medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs. similar to the united states, the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce program costs. for example, in 2006 the ontario government significantly revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act. in recent years, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, various provinces took further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs. these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers. these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company operations in canada. other provinces are considering similar changes, which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. individually or in combination, such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit. 15 table of contents mckesson corporation competition may erode our profit. in every area of healthcare distribution operations, our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition, both in price and service, from national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. in addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. price, quality of service, and in some cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment. our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization, as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. in recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers. during 2011, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our two largest customers, cvs and rite aid, accounted for approximately 14% and 11% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2011, accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 43% of total accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs, walmart and rite aid were approximately 13%, 10% and 9% of total accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations ( gpos ), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. a material default in payment, change in our customer mix, reduction in purchases, or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured. any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow. further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls. government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 16 table of contents mckesson corporation in addition, since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, and the cost accounting standards. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations. these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by the government including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad. public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers. we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company operating results. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our distribution solutions segment is dependent upon sophisticated information systems. the implementation delay, malfunction, or failure of these systems for any extended period of time could have a material adverse impact on our business. we rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to (1) facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers, (2) receive, process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis, (3) manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers, and (4) process payments to suppliers. if these systems are interrupted, damaged by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party, or fail for any extended period of time, we could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance. in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. one or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 17 table of contents mckesson corporation our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses (which include disease management programs and our nurse triage services) and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. if customers assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient. we also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. in addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations. our healthcare technology businesses, the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment, deliver enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, strategic management software solutions and pharmacy automation to hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail and mail order pharmacies and payers. challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers, and it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment. future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses. such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete. the success of our technology businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to be responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing business models. to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace, our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis. the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers, and thereby it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties. we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are equivalent or superior to our technology. in addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. although we believe that our products do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time-to-time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. if we were found to be infringing others rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing products or technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing technology. additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. these litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 18 table of contents mckesson corporation system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the software and software systems ( systems ) that we sell or operate are very complex. as with complex systems offered by others, our systems may contain errors, especially when first introduced. for example, our technology solutions segment business systems are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care. therefore, users of our systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. if our software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients, clinicians or patients. in addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales. failure of a client system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages. various risks could interrupt customers access to their data residing in our service center, exposing us to significant costs. we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers. the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers. our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation (1) power loss and telecommunications failures, (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters, (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes, and (4) computer viruses, hacking and similar disruptive problems. we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change control and system security measures, but our precautions may not protect against all problems. if customers access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services. the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles, which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation. how and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer. any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue. 19 table of contents mckesson corporation we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. we are required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) to test our goodwill for impairment, annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the company stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates and the loss of a significant customer. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. there are inherent uncertainties in management estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. our foreign operations may subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we have operations based in foreign countries, including canada, the united kingdom, ireland, other european countries and israel and we have a large investment in mexico. in the future, we look to continue to grow our foreign operations both organically and through acquisitions and investments; however, increasing our foreign operations carries additional risks. operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; import/export regulations in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. political changes and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. additionally, foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar. foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities, (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements or physical limitations that could impact continuous supply, and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. manufacturing difficulties could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 20 table of contents mckesson corporation tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. from time-to-time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. in addition, united states federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully. an element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. since 2008, we have completed approximately $3 billion of business acquisitions. integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, including the diversion of management attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; challenges in retaining the customers, including physician affiliates, of the combined businesses. further, acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed litigation and unknown liabilities. in addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets. if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements. although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. our $1.35 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will expire in may 2011. although we did not use this facility in 2010 or 2011, we have historically used it to fund working capital requirements, as needed. we anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration. although we believe we will be able to renew this facility, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. 21 table of contents mckesson corporation our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. additionally, if customers or suppliers operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements. our financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time-to-time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk: our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2011, interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported. our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. should interest rates decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2011, interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $17 million. the selected hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. as of march 31, 2011 and 2010, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $4.3 billion and $2.5 billion. the estimated fair value of our long-term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms. foreign exchange risk: we derive revenues and earnings from canada, the united kingdom, ireland, other european countries, israel and mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. as of march 31, 2011, a hypothetical adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk. 50 table of contents mckesson corporationquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. we are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. from time-to-time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving antitrust, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, tort and other various claims. all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. in some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. for some complaints filed against the company, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company. 11 table of contents mckesson corporation the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. for example, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings described in financial note 19, other commitments and contingent liabilities, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements that could have such an impact, including legal proceedings alleging that we engaged in illegal conduct that caused average wholesale prices to rise for certain prescription drugs during specified periods. litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation. for additional information regarding certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved, see financial note 19, other commitments and contingent liabilities, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future. changes in the healthcare industry or our pharmaceutical suppliers pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services. the majority of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide; however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, branded pharmaceutical price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation. healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase next year as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents. in recent years, our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings combined with an increase in the number of generic drug formularies available in the marketplace. changes in the availability, pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs, or changes in the rate of increase in the number of generic drugs, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. during the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product patent. to the extent we source, contract manufacture, and distribute such generic products, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us. while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us. 12 table of contents mckesson corporation in recent years, pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation. as a result, a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market. accordingly, we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers. many healthcare organizations also have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power. if this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the size of our target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services. in addition, when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems, which in turn may erode our customer and revenue base. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses and computer-related products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins, and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations. healthcare fraud: we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse, and the government, both state and federal, continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal health care program such as medicare and medicaid. many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become liable for damages, suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. reimbursements: both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. for example, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act (collectively the affordable care act ), signed into law in 2010, revised the federal upper limits for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175% of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price ( amp ) using a smoothing process. in addition, medicare, medicaid and the state children health insurance program ( schip ) extension act of 2007 requires the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) to adjust the calculation of the medicare part b drug average sales price to an actual sales volume basis. cms has proposed new rules for calculating amp ( revised amp ) and is also offering states the option to replace traditional reimbursement metrics for certain drugs with alternatives such as the average acquisition cost ( aac ) method. under aac, reimbursement is based on the actual acquisition costs from invoiced amounts and from a statistically validated cost of dispensing survey. we expect that the use of a revised amp benchmark or the use of an alternative reimbursement metric, such as aac, would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals, which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability. there can be no assurance that these changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 13 table of contents mckesson corporation operating, security and licensure standards: we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration (the dea ), the u. s. food and drug administration ( fda ), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ), the cms and other comparable agencies. certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of the dea, fda, hhs, cms, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. as part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. pedigree tracking: there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system ( pedigree tracking ). certain states have adopted or are considering laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system, while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations. for example, florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using radio frequency tagging and electronic pedigrees, which will be effective for us in july 2016. in addition, the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007, which went into effect on october 1, 2007, requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include any track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies. on march 26, 2010, the fda released the serialized numerical identifier ( sni ) guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging. we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations. nonetheless, these pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. privacy: state, federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released. these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures. regulations currently in place, including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. although we modified our policies, procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal and foreign laws, including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and the health information technology for economic and clinical health ( hitech ) act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, new laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate personal or patient information, or it could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations. it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customers. these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations. furthermore, failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. 14 table of contents mckesson corporation health care reform : the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers. although the u.s. supreme court is considering whether to strike down some or all of the act provisions, further federal and state proposals for healthcare reform are likely. we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. however, given the scope of the changes made and under consideration, as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms, we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time. interoperability standards: there is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other. this need for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups, and certain federal and state agencies are also developing standards that could become mandatory for systems purchased by these agencies. for example, the hitech act requires meaningful use of certified healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government. effective september 27, 2010, cms issued a rule that utilizes a staged approach for defining meaningful use criteria. under the staged approach, cms has issued rules that identify the initial criteria for meaningful use and is updating these initial criteria with additional rules. in addition, these standards are subject to interpretation by the entities designed to certify such technology. a combination of our solutions has been certified as meeting the initial criteria. however, we may incur increased development costs and delays in upgrading our customer software and systems to be in compliance with these varying and evolving standards. in addition, these new standards may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. to the extent these standards are narrowly construed or delayed in publication, or that we are delayed in achieving certification under these evolving standards for applicable products, our customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement our software and systems. fda regulation of medical software . the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software, computer products and computer-assisted products as medical devices under the federal food, drug and cosmetic act. for example, effective april 18, 2011, the fda issued a new rule regulating certain computer data systems as medical devices. if the fda chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the fda could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. additionally, beginning in calendar 2013, the affordable care act provides that a tax in an amount equal to 2.3 percent of the price for which the manufacturer sells its medical devices will have to be paid by each medical device manufacturer. since we sell medical devices, we may be impacted by this tax. any additional fda regulations governing computer products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products. standards for submission of health care claims : hhs has adopted two new rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement. the first rule modifies the standards for electronic health care transactions ( e.g. , eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from version 4010/4010a to version 5010. the enforcement deadline for the 5010 rule has been extended through june 30, 2012. the second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases, ninth revision ( icd-9 ) to international classification of diseases, tenth revision ( icd-10 ). hhs has postponed the compliance date for icd-10 conversion, previously october 1, 2013, for an unspecified period. updating systems to version 5010 is required for use of the icd-10 code set. generally, claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd-10 when required will not be processed, and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd-10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries. we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new standards. in addition, these standards may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers decisions to purchase our software and systems. 15 table of contents mckesson corporation medical billing and coding: medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws. in connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare, medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs. similar to the united states, the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce program costs. for example, in 2006 the ontario government significantly revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act. in recent years, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, various provinces took further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs. these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers. these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company operations in canada. other provinces are considering similar changes, which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. individually or in combination, such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit. competition may erode our profit. in every area of healthcare distribution operations, our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition, both in price and service, from national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. in addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. price, quality of service, and in some cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment. our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization, as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. in recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers. during 2012, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 52% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our two largest customers, cvs and rite aid, accounted for approximately 16% and 10% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2012, accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 49% of total accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs, walmart and rite aid were approximately 17%, 10% and 9% of total accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations ( gpos ), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. a material default in payment, change in our customer mix, reduction in purchases, or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 16 table of contents mckesson corporation we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured. any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow. further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls. government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, and the cost accounting standards. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations. these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by the government including disallowance of costs claimed, monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad. public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers. we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company operating results. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 table of contents mckesson corporation our distribution solutions segment is dependent upon sophisticated information systems. the implementation delay, malfunction, or failure of these systems for any extended period of time or breach of these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. we rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to: (1) facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; (2) receive, process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis; (3) manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and (4) process payments to suppliers. if these systems are interrupted, damaged or breached by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party, such as a cyber attack, or fail for any extended period of time, we could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance. in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. one or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses (which include care management programs and our nurse advice services) and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient. we also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. in addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations. our healthcare technology businesses, the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment, deliver enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, strategic management software solutions and pharmacy automation to hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail and mail order pharmacies and payers. challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers, and it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment. future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses. such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete. the success of our technology businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to be responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing business models. to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace, our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis. the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers, and thereby it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 18 table of contents mckesson corporation proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties. we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or solutions that are equivalent or superior to ours. in addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. although we believe that our products, solutions and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time-to-time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. if we were found to be infringing others rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing products or technology, obtain a license or cease selling or using the products that contain the infringing elements. additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. these litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the software and software systems ( systems ) that we sell or operate are very complex. as with complex systems offered by others, our systems may contain errors, especially when first introduced. for example, our technology solutions segment business systems are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care. therefore, users of our systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. if our software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients, clinicians or patients. in addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales. failure of a client system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages. various risks could interrupt customers access to their data residing in our service center, exposing us to significant costs. we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers. the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers. our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; and (4) cyber attacks, computer viruses, hacking and other similar disruptive problems. we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change controls, information security procedures, and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security, but our precautions may not protect against all risks. if customers access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. if customers access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third party service providers, we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services. 19 table of contents mckesson corporation the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles, which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation. how and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer. any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. we are required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) to test our goodwill for impairment, annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the company stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates and the loss of a significant customer. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. there are inherent uncertainties in management estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. our foreign operations may subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we have operations based in, and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products in, a number of foreign countries. in the future, we look to continue to grow our foreign operations both organically and through acquisitions and investments; however, increasing our foreign operations carries additional risks. operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; import/export regulations in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. political changes and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad. additionally, foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar. foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 20 table of contents mckesson corporation we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to: (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities; (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand; (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, physical limitations, or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply; and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. manufacturing difficulties could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. from time-to-time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation. for example, if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes, it would adversely impact our cash flow, and if legislation is passed to change the current u.s. taxation treatment of income from foreign operations, it may adversely impact our income tax expense. the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully. an element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. since 2010, we have completed approximately $3.4 billion of business acquisitions. integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, including the diversion of management attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; challenges in retaining the customers, including physician affiliates, of the combined businesses. further, acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed litigation and unknown liabilities. in addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets. if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements. although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. 21 table of contents mckesson corporation our $1.35 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will expire in may 2012. historically, we have primarily used the accounts receivable sales facility to fund working capital requirements, as needed. we anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration. although we believe we will be able to renew this facility, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. additionally, if customers or suppliers operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements. our financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time-to-time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk: our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2012, interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported. our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. should interest rates decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2012, interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $18 million. the selected hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. as of march 31, 2012 and 2011, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion. the estimated fair value of our long-term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms. foreign exchange risk: we derive revenues and earnings from canada, the united kingdom, ireland, other european countries, israel and mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. as of march 31, 2012, a hypothetical adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk. 50 table of contents mckesson corporationrisk factors. the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future. changes in the healthcare industry's or our pharmaceutical suppliers' pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services. the majority of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business' agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide; however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, branded pharmaceutical price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation. in recent years, our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings combined with an increase in the number of generic drug formularies available in the marketplace. in fiscal year 2015, we anticipate the number of branded to generics conversions to increase as compared to the prior year. continued volatility in the availability, pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs, or significant fluctuations in the rate of increase in the number of generic drugs, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. during the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product's patent. to the extent we source, contract manufacture, and distribute such generic products, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us. while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses and computer-related products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins, and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations. 11 table of contents mckesson corporation healthcare fraud: we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse, and the government, both state and federal, continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid. many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. reimbursements: both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. for example, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act (collectively the affordable care act ), signed into law in 2010, revised the federal upper limits for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175% of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price ( amp ) using a smoothing process. the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) has proposed new rules for calculating amp ( revised amp ) and is also offering states the option to replace traditional reimbursement metrics for certain drugs with alternatives such as the average acquisition cost ( aac ) method or the national average drug acquisition cost benchmark ( nadac ). under aac and nadac, reimbursement is based on the actual acquisition costs from invoiced amounts and from a statistically validated cost of dispensing survey. states will have the option of using any of these metrics to determine appropriate medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies for generic or brand drugs. we expect that the use of a revised amp benchmark or the use of an alternative reimbursement metric, such as aac or nadac, would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals, which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability. the federal government may adopt measures that could reduce medicare and/or medicaid spending, or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities. for example, under the terms of the budget control act of 2011, an automatic 2% reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after april 1, 2013. this automatic reduction is known as sequestration. medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of average sales price ( asp ) plus 6%. the implementation of sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6% level for the duration of sequestration (which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation). additionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program, or both. we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions, if any, will ultimately be enacted into law, or the timing or effect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us. there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 12 table of contents mckesson corporation operating, security and licensure standards: we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration (the dea ), the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ), the cms and other comparable agencies. certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of the dea, fda, hhs, cms, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. in addition, and as part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. pedigree tracking: there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system ( pedigree tracking ). in november 2013, congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act ( dqsa ). the dqsa will establish federal standards requiring supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable, lot-level prescription drug track and trace system. the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements. in addition, the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007, which went into effect on october 1, 2007, requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include any track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies. on march 26, 2010, the fda released the serialized numerical identifier ( sni ) guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging. we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations. the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. privacy: state, federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released. these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures. regulations currently in place, including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. although we modified our policies, procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal and foreign laws, including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and the health information technology for economic and clinical health ( hitech ) act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, new laws and regulations in this area could restrict our or our customers' ability to obtain, use or disseminate personal or patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations. it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customers. these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations. furthermore, our failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. healthcare reform : the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates. we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. however, given the scope of the changes made and under consideration, as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms, we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time. 13 table of contents mckesson corporation interoperability standards and meaningful use requirement: there is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other. this demand for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups, such as commonwell health alliance, which the company and other healthcare it companies announced in 2013. certain federal and state agencies also are developing standards that could become mandatory for software and systems purchased by these agencies, or used by our customers. for example, the hitech act requires meaningful use of certified healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government. although several of our healthcare information technology products have received certification while others are on track to receive certification, rules regarding meaningful use may be changed or supplemented in the future. as a result, we may incur increased development costs and delays in receiving certification for our products, and changing or supplementing rules also may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle. we also may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. to the extent these rules subsequently are changed or supplemented, or we are delayed in receiving certification for our products, customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement these products. fda regulation of medical software: the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the federal food, drug and cosmetic act. for example, in 2011 the fda issued a rule on medical device data systems (mdds) that now regulates certain software systems that electronically store, transfer or display data originating from medical devices as class 1 medical devices (i.e., those devices deemed by the fda to be low risk and subject to the least regulatory controls) themselves. if the fda chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the fda could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. any additional fda regulations governing health information technology products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products. standards for submission of healthcare claims : hhs previously adopted two rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement. the first rule modifies the standards for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from version 4010/4010a to version 5010. the enforcement deadline for the 5010 rule was extended through june 30, 2012 and many healthcare providers began implementing the 5010 rule. the second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases, ninth revision ( icd-9 ) to international classification of diseases, tenth revision ( icd-10 ). as a consequence of the passage of the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 in march, the compliance date for icd-10 conversion has been postponed from october 1, 2014 to october 1, 2015. updating systems to version 5010 for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) is required for use of the icd-10 code set. generally, claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd-10 when required will not be processed, and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd-10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries. we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new rules. in addition, these rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new rules may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers' decisions to purchase our software and systems. medical billing and coding: medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws. in connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare, medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 14 table of contents mckesson corporation changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs. similar to the united states, the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce program costs. for example, the ontario government significantly revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act. in recent years, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, various provinces took further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs. these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers. these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company's operations in canada. other provinces are considering similar changes, which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. individually or in combination, such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit. changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in europe, we are subject to the european union ( eu ) data protection regulations, including the eu directive on data protection, which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. the eu regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. in addition to this eu-wide legislation, certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we have operations based in, and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products in, a number of foreign countries. the company's acquisition of celesio significantly increases the importance of our foreign operations to our future operations and growth. our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks. operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies; unexpected regulatory, social, political, or economic changes in a specific country or region; changes in intellectual property, privacy and data protection; import/export regulations in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. political changes, labor strikes, acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad. additionally, foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations, including uncertainty regarding the euro, the canadian dollar, the british pound sterling and the brazilian real, that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar. since substantially all of celesio's revenues are generated outside of the united states, the company's acquisition of celesio significantly increases our exposure to these risks. foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. the u.k. bribery act, for example, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the u.k. bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 15 table of contents mckesson corporation we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to: (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities; (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand; (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, physical limitations, or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply; and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. for example, the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the u.s. from overseas plants due to quality issues. difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully. an element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses. further, acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed litigation and unknown liabilities. in addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets. if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. on february 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of celesio and certain convertible bonds of celesio. upon the acquisition, our ownership of celesio's fully diluted shares was 75.6%. at march 31, 2014, we owned approximately 75.4% of celesio's outstanding and fully diluted common shares. celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. celesio's headquarters is in stuttgart, germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world. the acquisition of celesio expands our global geographic area; the combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide. achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of celesio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including foreign exchange fluctuations, challenges of managing new international operations, and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of celesio's product and services. the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated, and could result in the loss of employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition. any significant diversion of management's attention away from the ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition, transition and integration process, could adversely affect our financial results, both prior to and after the acquisition of celesio. moreover, the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. events outside of our control, including the market price of celesio shares that we did not acquire in the acquisition, changes in regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from our acquisition of celesio. 16 table of contents mckesson corporation the process to obtain operational control of celesio, including celesio shareholder approval of the domination and profit and loss agreement and registration of the domination and profit and loss agreement in the celesio corporate register is complex and we do not expect to complete the steps required to exercise operating control of celesio until late in the first half of our fiscal 2015. until the domination and profit and loss agreement is registered and effective, celesio will not be subject to direct management control by us and celesio's profits can only be distributed by the declaration of dividends. in the event that a minority shareholder of celesio files an action to challenge the registration, or the registration is delayed by german courts, it may prevent us from exercising operational control of celesio on the anticipated timeline, or at all. our pursuit of the celesio acquisition and the preparation for the integration of celesio's business over an extended period of time may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources, as well as the management and internal resources of celesio. in the event that our acquisition of celesio's remaining then outstanding common shares is significantly delayed, it may prevent the celesio acquisition from being consummated on the anticipated timeline, which could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, and could result in our incurring significant expenses related to the celesio acquisition without realizing the expected benefits. we are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. from time- to-time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving false claims, healthcare fraud and abuse, antitrust, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, tort and other various claims. all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. in some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. for some complaints filed against the company, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company. the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management's time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation. european economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the company's acquisition of celesio significantly increases our assets and operations within europe and, accordingly, our exposure to economic conditions in europe. a further slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in many european countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. in recent years, in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe, a number of european governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures. for example, in 2011, the french government introduced a new wholesale mark-up system that constrained distribution margins on pharmaceuticals. these measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay. countries with existing healthcare-related austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. in addition, european governments that have not yet imposed healthcare-related austerity measures may impose them in the future. new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 17 table of contents mckesson corporation competition may erode our profit. in every area of healthcare distribution operations, our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition, both in price and service, from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. in addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. price, quality of service, and in some cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment. in recent years, pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation. as a result, a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market. accordingly, we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers. many healthcare organizations have also consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power. if this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the size of our target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services. in addition, when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems, which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base. our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization, as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. in recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers. during 2014 , sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 48% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our largest customer, cvs , accounted for approximately 16% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2014 , trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 32% of total trade accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs were approximately 12% of total trade accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations ( gpos ), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. a material default in payment, change in our customer mix, reduction in purchases, or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured. any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow. further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls. government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 18 table of contents mckesson corporation in addition, because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, and the cost accounting standards. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations. these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by the government including disallowance of costs claimed, monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad. public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers. we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company's operating results. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are dependent upon sophisticated information systems. the malfunction, failure or breach of these systems to perform as designed could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information, financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. we also rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to: (1) facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; (2) receive, process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis; (3) manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and (4) process payments to suppliers. in europe, celesio outsources its it infrastructure to an external service provider. if these systems are interrupted, damaged or breached by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party, including a cyber attack, or fail for any extended period of time, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. cyber attacks can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional incidents involving unauthorized access to computer systems or data that could result in the misappropriation or loss of assets or the disclosure of sensitive information, the corruption of data, or other disruption of business operations. similarly, denial-of-service or other internet-based attacks may range from mere vandalism of electronic systems to systematic theft of sensitive information and intellectual property. although we actively devote significant resources to protect and maintain the confidentiality of all information in our possession, preventing all cyber incidents is inherently difficult. therefore, any compromise of our electronic systems, including the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of sensitive information or a significant disruption of our computing assets and networks, would adversely affect our reputation, our ability to fulfill contractual obligations and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. moreover, unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of such sensitive information could result in a civil, criminal or regulatory action, including potential fines and penalties. any real or perceived compromise of our security or disclosure of sensitive information may also result in lost revenues by deterring customers from using or purchasing our products and services in the future. 19 table of contents mckesson corporation we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance. in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment's customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. one or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses (which include care management programs and our nurse advice services) and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management's attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient. we also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. in addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the acquisition of celesio exposes us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services. pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. although celesio maintains liability insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims. if celesio's insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or celesio suffers reputational harm as a result of an error or omission, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations. our healthcare technology businesses, the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment, deliver enterprise wide and single entity clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain and strategic management software solutions to hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail and mail order pharmacies and payers. challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment. future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses. such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete. the success of our technology businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to be responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing business models. to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace, our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis. the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers, and thereby could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 20 table of contents mckesson corporation proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties. we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or solutions that are equivalent or superior to ours. in addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. although we believe that our products, solutions and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. if we were found to be infringing others' rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing products or technology, obtain a license or cease selling or using the products that contain the infringing elements. additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. these litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the software and technology services ( systems ) that we sell or operate are complex. as with complex systems offered by others, our systems may contain errors, especially when first introduced. for example, our technology solutions segment's business systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care. therefore, users of our systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. if our software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients, clinicians or patients. in addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales. failure of a customer's system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages. various risks could interrupt customers' access to their data residing in our service center, exposing us to significant costs. we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers. the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers. our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; and (4) cyber attacks, computer viruses, hacking and other similar disruptive problems. we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change controls, information security procedures, and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security, but our precautions may not protect against all risks. if customers' access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. if customers' access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third party service providers, we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services. 21 table of contents mckesson corporation the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles, which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation. how and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer. any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. we are required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) to test our goodwill for impairment, annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a divestiture indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. there are inherent uncertainties in management's estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. from time-to-time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation. for example, if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes, it would adversely impact our cash flow. additionally, if legislation is passed to change the current u.s. taxation treatment of income from foreign operations, or if legislation is passed at the state level to establish or increase taxation on the basis of our gross revenues, it may adversely impact our tax expense. the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 22 table of contents mckesson corporation volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements. although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. our $1.35 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will expire in november 2014. historically, we have primarily used the accounts receivable sales facility to fund working capital requirements, as needed. we anticipate extending or renewing this facility before its expiration. although we believe we will be able to renew this facility, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. additionally, if customers' or suppliers' operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements. our financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time-to-time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate or one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities. we participate in various multiemployer pension plans. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make an additional cash contribution to the plans, payable in installments and/or lump sum. our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. our multiemployer plans could have significant underfunded liabilities. such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. in addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk: our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. at march 31, 2014, we had $1.0 billion in outstanding debt with variable interest rates. our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. at march 31, 2014, we had $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2014 of approximately $12 million. foreign exchange risk: historically, we have recorded foreign revenues and earnings primarily from canada, the united kingdom, ireland, other european countries and israel, which exposed us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. our acquisition of a majority interest in celesio in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and expanded our portfolio of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. as substantially all revenues and earnings of celesio are generated outside of the united states, changes in the u.s. dollar relative to the functional currency in the countries in which celesio operates, primarily the euro and the british pound, could impact future earnings. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency loans. as of march 31, 2014, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of celesio's foreign exchange contracts by approximately $94 million. as of march 31, 2014, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our remaining foreign exchange contracts by approximately $40 million. however, celesio's risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. refer to financial note 18, hedging activities, for more information on our foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. 52 table of contents mckesson corporationrisk factors. the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. 10 table of contents mckesson corporation we are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. from time-to-time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving antitrust, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, tort and other various claims. all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. in some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. for some complaints filed against the company, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company. the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. for example, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings described in financial note 22, other commitments and contingent liabilities, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements that could have such an impact, including legal proceedings alleging that we engaged in illegal conduct that caused average wholesale prices to rise for certain prescription drugs during specified periods. litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management's time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation. for additional information regarding certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved, see financial note 22, other commitments and contingent liabilities, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future. changes in the healthcare industry's or our pharmaceutical suppliers' pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services. the majority of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business' agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide; however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, branded pharmaceutical price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation. in recent years, our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings combined with an increase in the number of generic drug formularies available in the marketplace. however, in fiscal year 2014 we anticipate the number of branded to generics conversions to decrease as compared to recent years. continued volatility in the availability, pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs, or significant fluctuations in the rate of increase in the number of generic drugs, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 11 table of contents mckesson corporation generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. during the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product's patent. to the extent we source, contract manufacture, and distribute such generic products, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us. while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us. in recent years, pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation. as a result, a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market. accordingly, we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers. many healthcare organizations have also consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power. if this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the size of our target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services. in addition, when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems, which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base. the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses and computer-related products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins, and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations. healthcare fraud: we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse, and the government, both state and federal, continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal health care program such as medicare and medicaid. many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become liable for damages, suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. reimbursements: both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. for example, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act (collectively the affordable care act ), signed into law in 2010, revised the federal upper limits for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175% of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price ( amp ) using a smoothing process. in addition, medicare, medicaid and the state children's health insurance program ( schip ) extension act of 2007 requires the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) to adjust the calculation of the medicare part b drug average sales price to an actual sales volume basis. cms has proposed new rules for calculating amp ( revised amp ) and is also offering states the option to replace traditional reimbursement metrics for certain drugs with alternatives such as the average acquisition cost ( aac ) method. under aac, reimbursement is based on the actual acquisition costs from invoiced amounts and from a statistically validated cost of dispensing survey. in addition, cms has begun conducting a national survey of pharmacies to create a national average drug acquisition cost benchmark ( nadac ). states may use the results of this survey to set pharmacy payment rates. cms released the first draft of the pricing data determined through the nadac survey as well as an alternate reimbursement methodology called national average retail price ( narp ). narp represents the average consumer purchase price of the most commonly dispensed brand and generic drugs. states will have the option of using any of these metrics to determine appropriate medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies for generic or brand drugs. 12 table of contents mckesson corporation we expect that the use of a revised amp benchmark or the use of an alternative reimbursement metric, such as aac or narp, would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals, which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability. the federal government may adopt measures that could further reduce medicare and/or medicaid spending, or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities. for instance, on august 2, 2011, the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011, which provided for an automatic 2% reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers in january 2013. on january 2, 2013, the president signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, which delayed this reduction until march 2013, at which time the president issued an executive order implementing it. this automatic reduction is known as sequestration. additionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program, or both. we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions, if any, will ultimately be enacted into law, or the timing or effect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us. there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. operating, security and licensure standards: we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration (the dea ), the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ), the cms and other comparable agencies. certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of the dea, fda, hhs, cms, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. as part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. pedigree tracking: there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system ( pedigree tracking ). certain states have adopted or are considering laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system, while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations. for example, florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using radio frequency tagging and electronic pedigrees, which will be effective for us in july 2016. in addition, the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007, which went into effect on october 1, 2007, requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include any track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies. on march 26, 2010, the fda released the serialized numerical identifier ( sni ) guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging. we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations. nonetheless, these pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 13 table of contents mckesson corporation privacy: state, federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released. these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures. regulations currently in place, including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. although we modified our policies, procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal and foreign laws, including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and the health information technology for economic and clinical health ( hitech ) act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, new laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate personal or patient information, or it could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations. it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customers. these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations. furthermore, our failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. health care reform : the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers. while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates. we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. however, given the scope of the changes made and under consideration, as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms, we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time. interoperability standards: there is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other. this need for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups, and certain federal and state agencies are also developing standards that could become mandatory for systems purchased by these agencies. for example, the hitech act requires meaningful use of certified healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government, and cms has issued rules defining meaningful use criteria. these rules are subject to interpretation by the entities designed to certify such technology and also may be changed or supplemented by the federal government in the future. a combination of our solutions has been certified as meeting the initial meaningful use criteria, and we plan to seek certification for meeting additional meaningful use criteria. however, we may incur increased development costs and delays in upgrading our customer software and systems to be in compliance with these varying and evolving rules. in addition, these new rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. to the extent these rules are narrowly construed, subsequently changed or supplemented, or that we are delayed in achieving certification under these evolving rules for applicable products, our customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement our software and systems. fda regulation of medical software: the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software, computer products and computer-assisted products as medical devices under the federal food, drug and cosmetic act. for example, effective april 18, 2011, the fda issued a new rule regulating certain computer data systems as medical devices. if the fda chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the fda could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. any additional fda regulations governing computer products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products. 14 table of contents mckesson corporation standards for submission of health care claims : hhs previously adopted two rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement. the first rule modifies the standards for electronic health care transactions ( e.g. , eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from version 4010/4010a to version 5010. the enforcement deadline for the 5010 rule was extended through june 30, 2012 and many healthcare providers have now begun implementing the 5010 rule. the second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases, ninth revision ( icd-9 ) to international classification of diseases, tenth revision ( icd-10 ). hhs has postponed the compliance date for icd-10 conversion, previously october 1, 2013, until october 1, 2014. updating systems to version 5010 is required for use of the icd-10 code set. generally, claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd-10 when required will not be processed, and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd-10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries. we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new rules. in addition, these rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new rules may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers' decisions to purchase our software and systems. medical billing and coding: medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws. in connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare, medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs. similar to the united states, the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce program costs. for example, in 2006 the ontario government significantly revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act. in recent years, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, various provinces took further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs. these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers. these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company's operations in canada. other provinces are considering similar changes, which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. individually or in combination, such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit. competition may erode our profit. in every area of healthcare distribution operations, our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition, both in price and service, from national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. in addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. price, quality of service, and in some cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment. our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 15 table of contents mckesson corporation a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization, as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. in recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers. during 2013 , sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our largest customer, cvs , accounted for approximately 17% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2013 , trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 44% of total trade accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs and walmart were approximately 16% and 10% of total trade accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations ( gpos ), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. a material default in payment, change in our customer mix, reduction in purchases, or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured. any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow. further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls. government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, and the cost accounting standards. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations. these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by the government including disallowance of costs claimed, monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 16 table of contents mckesson corporation our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad. public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers. we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company's operating results. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are dependent upon sophisticated information systems. the malfunction, failure or breach of these systems to perform as designed could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information, financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. we also rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to: (1) facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; (2) receive, process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis; (3) manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and (4) process payments to suppliers. if these systems are interrupted, damaged or breached by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party, including a cyber attack, or fail for any extended period of time, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. cyber attacks can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional incidents involving unauthorized access to computer systems or data that could result in the misappropriation or loss of assets or the disclosure of sensitive information, the corruption of data, or other disruption of business operations. similarly, denial-of-service or other internet-based attacks may range from mere vandalism of electronic systems to systematic theft of sensitive information and intellectual property. although we actively devote significant resources to protect and maintain the confidentiality of all information in our possession, preventing all cyber incidents is inherently difficult. therefore, any compromise of our electronic systems, including the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of sensitive information or a significant disruption of our computing assets and networks, would adversely affect our reputation, our ability to fulfill contractual obligations and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. moreover, unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of such sensitive information could result in a civil, criminal or regulatory action, including potential fines and penalties. any real or perceived compromise of our security or disclosure of sensitive information may also result in lost revenues by deterring customers from using or purchasing our products and services in the future. we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance. in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment's customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. one or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses (which include care management programs and our nurse advice services) and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management's attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient. we also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. in addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 17 table of contents mckesson corporation the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations. our healthcare technology businesses, the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment, deliver enterprise wide and single entity clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, strategic management software solutions and pharmacy automation to hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail and mail order pharmacies and payers. challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers, and it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment. future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses. such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete. the success of our technology businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to be responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing business models. to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace, our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis. the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers, and thereby it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties. we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or solutions that are equivalent or superior to ours. in addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. although we believe that our products, solutions and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time-to-time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. if we were found to be infringing others' rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing products or technology, obtain a license or cease selling or using the products that contain the infringing elements. additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. these litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the software and software systems ( systems ) that we sell or operate are very complex. as with complex systems offered by others, our systems may contain errors, especially when first introduced. for example, our technology solutions segment's business systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care. therefore, users of our systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. if our software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients, clinicians or patients. in addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales. failure of a client's system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages. 18 table of contents mckesson corporation various risks could interrupt customers' access to their data residing in our service center, exposing us to significant costs. we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers. the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers. our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; and (4) cyber attacks, computer viruses, hacking and other similar disruptive problems. we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change controls, information security procedures, and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security, but our precautions may not protect against all risks. if customers' access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. if customers' access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third party service providers, we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services. the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles, which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation. how and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer. any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. we are required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) to test our goodwill for impairment, annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates and the loss of a significant customer. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. there are inherent uncertainties in management's estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. 19 table of contents mckesson corporation our foreign operations may subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we have operations based in, and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products in, a number of foreign countries. in the future, we look to continue to grow our foreign operations both organically and through acquisitions and investments; however, increasing our foreign operations carries additional risks. operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; import/export regulations in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. political changes and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad. additionally, foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar. foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to: (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities; (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand; (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, physical limitations, or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply; and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. manufacturing difficulties could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. from time-to-time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation. for example, if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes, it would adversely impact our cash flow, and if legislation is passed to change the current u.s. taxation treatment of income from foreign operations, it may adversely impact our income tax expense. the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully. an element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. since 2011 , we have completed approximately $5.8 billion of business acquisitions. integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; challenges in retaining the customers, including physician affiliates, of the combined businesses. further, acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed litigation and unknown liabilities. in addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets. if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. 20 table of contents mckesson corporation volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements. although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. our $1.35 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will expire in may 2013. historically, we have primarily used the accounts receivable sales facility to fund working capital requirements, as needed. we anticipate extending or renewing this facility before its expiration. although we believe we will be able to renew this facility, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. additionally, if customers' or suppliers' operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements. our financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time-to-time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk: our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2013 , interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported. our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. should interest rates decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2013 , interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $12 million. the selected hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. as of march 31, 2013 and 2012 , the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $5.5 billion and $4.1 billion. the estimated fair value of our long-term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms. foreign exchange risk: we record revenues and earnings from canada, the united kingdom, ireland, other european countries, israel and mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. as of march 31, 2013 , a hypothetical adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk. 49 table of contents mckesson corporationrisk factors the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. many of our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, increases in the use of managed care, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future. changes in the healthcare industry's or our pharmaceutical suppliers' pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services. the majority of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide; however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, branded pharmaceutical price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 11 table of contents mckesson corporation in addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation. in recent years, our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings combined with an increase in the number of generic drugs available in the marketplace. in fiscal year 2016, we anticipate the number of branded to generics conversions to increase as compared to the prior year. continued volatility in the availability, pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs, or significant fluctuations in the rate of increase in the number of generic drugs, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. during the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product's patent. to the extent we source, contract manufacture, and distribute such generic products, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us. while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us. the healthcare industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology-related products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins, and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations. healthcare fraud: we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse. local, state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid. many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. the regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. reimbursements: both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. for example, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act (collectively the affordable care act ), signed into law in 2010, revised the federal upper limits for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175% of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price ( amp ) using a smoothing process. the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) has proposed new rules for calculating amp ( revised amp ) and is also offering states the option to replace traditional reimbursement metrics for certain drugs with alternatives such as the average acquisition cost ( aac ) method or the national average drug acquisition cost benchmark ( nadac ). under aac and nadac, reimbursement is based on the actual acquisition costs from invoiced amounts and from a statistically validated cost of dispensing survey. states will have the option of using any of these metrics to determine appropriate medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies for generic or brand drugs. we expect that the use of a revised amp benchmark or the use of an alternative reimbursement metric, such as aac or nadac, would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals, which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability. 12 table of contents mckesson corporation the federal government may adopt measures that could reduce medicare and/or medicaid spending, or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities. for example, under the terms of the budget control act of 2011, an automatic 2% reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after april 1, 2013. this automatic reduction is known as sequestration. medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of average sales price ( asp ) plus 6%. the implementation of sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6% level for the duration of sequestration (which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation). as another example, the medicare access and chip reauthorization act ( macra ), signed into law in april 2015, seeks to reform medicare reimbursement policy for physician fee schedule services and adopts a series of policy changes affecting a wide range of providers and suppliers. most notably, macra repeals the statutory sustainable growth rate formula, which has called for cuts in medicare rates in recent years, but which congress routinely stepped in to override the full application of the formula. instead, after a period of stable payment updates, macra links physician payment updates to quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models. macra also extends certain expiring medicare and other health policy provisions, including extending the children's health insurance program. additionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program, or both. we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions, if any, will ultimately be enacted into law, or the timing or affect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us. there can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. operating, security and licensure standards: we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration ( dea ), the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ), the cms and other comparable agencies. certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of the dea, fda, hhs, cms, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. for example, we are required to hold valid dea and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and distribution of controlled substances. as part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. in some instances, these can lead to monetary penalties and/or license revocation. in march 2015, we reached an agreement in principle with the dea and department of justice pursuant to which we agreed to pay the sum of $150 million to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company's suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances. although we have enhanced our procedures to ensure compliance, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. pedigree tracking: there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, otherwise known as pedigree tracking. in november 2013, congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act ( dqsa ). the dqsa establishes federal standards requiring supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable, lot-level prescription drug track and trace system. the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements. in addition, the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007, which went into effect on october 1, 2007, requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies. on march 26, 2010, the fda released the serialized numerical identifier ( sni ) guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging. we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations. the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 13 table of contents mckesson corporation privacy: state, federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of personal information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released. these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures. regulations currently in place, including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. although we modified our policies, procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal and foreign laws, including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and the health information technology for economic and clinical health ( hitech ) act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, new laws and regulations in this area could further restrict our or our customers' ability to obtain, use or disseminate personal or patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products or systems in a timely manner, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations. it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customer. these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations. furthermore, our failure to maintain the confidentiality of personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims, tort damages, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. healthcare reform : the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates. we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. however, given the scope of the changes made and under consideration, as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms, we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time. interoperability and meaningful use requirement: there is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other. in 2013, in order to address this demand for interoperability we and a number of other healthcare it companies co-founded the commonwell health alliance with the aim of developing a standard for data sharing among doctors, hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. certain federal and state agencies also are developing standards that could become mandatory for software and systems purchased by these agencies, or used by our customers. with respect to legislation addressing interoperability, macra promotes and defines interoperability, requires metrics to measure interoperability, and requires vendors and providers to attest that they are not blocking data. regarding meaningful use requirements, the hitech act requires meaningful use of certified healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government. although several of our healthcare information technology products have received certification, rules regarding meaningful use may be changed or supplemented in the future. as a result of interoperability and meaningful requirements, we may incur increased development costs and delays in receiving certification for our products, and changing or supplementing rules also may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle. we also may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. to the extent these requirements subsequently are changed or supplemented, or we are delayed in receiving certification for our products, customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement these products. fda regulation of medical software: the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the federal food, drug and cosmetic act. for example, in 2011 the fda issued a rule on medical device data systems that regulates certain software systems that electronically store, transfer or display data originating from medical devices as class 1 medical devices (i.e., those devices deemed by the fda to be low risk and subject to the least regulatory controls) themselves. however, in february 2015, the fda issued guidance to inform manufacturers and distributors of medical device data systems that it did not intend to enforce compliance with regulatory controls that apply to medical device data systems, medical image storage devices, and medical image communication devices. if the fda chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices, or subsequently changes or reverses its guidance regarding not enforcing regulatory controls for certain medical device products, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the fda could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. any additional fda regulations governing health information technology products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products. 14 table of contents mckesson corporation standards for submission of healthcare claims : hhs previously adopted two rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement. the first rule modifies the standards for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from version 4010/4010a to version 5010. the second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases, ninth revision ( icd-9 ) to international classification of diseases, tenth revision ( icd-10 ). as a consequence of the passage of the protecting access to medicare act of 2014, the compliance date for icd-10 conversion has been postponed from october 1, 2014 to october 1, 2015. updating systems to version 5010 for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) is required for use of the icd-10 code set. generally, claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd-10 when required will not be processed, and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd-10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries. we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new rules. in addition, these rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new rules may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers' decisions to purchase our software and systems. medical billing and coding: medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws. in connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare, medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we have operations based in, and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products in, a number of foreign countries. the company's acquisition of celesio significantly increases the importance of our foreign operations to our future operations and growth. our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks including changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies; unexpected regulatory, social, political, or economic changes in a specific country or region; changes in intellectual property, privacy and data protection; import/export regulations and trade sanctions in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. political changes, labor strikes, acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad. foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. the u.k. bribery act, for example, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the u.k. bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to: (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities; (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand; (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, physical limitations, or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply; and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. for example, the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the u.s. from overseas plants due to quality issues. difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. 15 table of contents mckesson corporation changes in the canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs. similar to the united states, provincial governments in canada have introduced significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. for example, in 2006, the government of ontario considerably revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act. in recent years, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, provincial governments have taken further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs. these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers. these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company's operations in canada. other provinces have implemented or are considering similar changes, which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. individually or in combination, such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit. general european economic conditions, together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the company's acquisition of celesio increased our assets and operations within europe and, accordingly, our exposure to economic conditions in europe. a slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services. a slowdown may also reduce the demand for our products, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. in recent years, in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe, a number of european governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures. for example, in 2011, the french government introduced a new wholesale mark-up system that constrained distribution margins on pharmaceuticals. these measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay. countries with existing healthcare-related austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. in addition, european governments that have not yet imposed healthcare-related austerity measures may impose them in the future. new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in europe, we are subject to the european union ( eu ) data protection regulations, including the eu directive on data protection, which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. the eu regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. in addition to this eu-wide legislation, certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards. the company has addressed these requirements by certification to the u.s.-eu safe harbor frameworks. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 16 table of contents mckesson corporation our results of operations, which are stated in u.s. dollars, could be adversely impacted by foreign currency fluctuations. as all of celesio's revenues are generated outside of the united states, the company's acquisition of celesio significantly increases our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risks. these risks include uncertainty regarding the brazilian real, the british pound sterling, the canadian dollar, the euro, and the norwegian krone that could adversely impact our results of operations and capital ratios based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar. fluctuating exchange rates cause the value of items on both the assets and liabilities side of the balance sheet to change, which could also negatively impact our results of operations. our financial results and capital ratios will therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. a depreciation of non-u.s. dollar currencies relative to the u.s. dollar could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully. an element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses. further, acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed litigation and unknown liabilities. in addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets. if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. on february 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of celesio and certain convertible bonds of celesio. upon the acquisition, our ownership of celesio's fully diluted shares was 75.6%. celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. on december 2, 2014, we obtained the ability to pursue the integration of the two companies upon the effectiveness of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the domination agreement ). achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of celesio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including foreign exchange fluctuations, challenges of managing new international operations, and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of celesio's product and services. the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized or, if realized, the timing of its realization. it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated, and could result in the loss of employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. any significant diversion of management's attention away from the ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition, transition and integration process, could adversely affect our financial results. moreover, the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and could adversely affect our future business, financial position and operating results. events outside of our control, including the market price of celesio shares that we did not acquire in the acquisition, changes in regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from our acquisition of celesio. 17 table of contents mckesson corporation our business and results of operations could be impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures. we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives. for example, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business and a small business from our distribution solutions segment, as well as a small business from our technology solutions segment. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. we may also experience greater dissynergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. after reaching an agreement with a buyer, we are subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the sale. dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. from time-to-time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings involving false claims, healthcare fraud and abuse, antitrust, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, licensing, tort and other various claims. all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments. in some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. for some complaints filed against the company, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company. the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management's time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation. competition may erode our profit. in every area of healthcare distribution operations, our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition, both in price and service, from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. in addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. price, quality of service, and in some cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment. in recent years, pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation. as a result, a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market. accordingly, we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers. many healthcare organizations that purchase our products and services have also consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power. if this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the number of market participants and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services. in addition, when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems, which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base. our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 18 table of contents mckesson corporation a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization, as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. in recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers. during 2015 , sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our largest customer, cvs caremark corporation ( cvs ) , accounted for approximately 15% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2015 , trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 36% of total trade accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs were approximately 14% of total trade accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations ( gpos ), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. a material default in payment, change in our customer mix, reduction in purchases, or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured. any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow. further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities. government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, and the cost accounting standards. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations. these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by a government including disallowance of costs claimed, monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 19 table of contents mckesson corporation our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad. public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers. we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company's operating results. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we are dependent upon sophisticated information systems. the malfunction, failure or breach of these systems to perform as designed could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information, financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. we also rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to: (1) facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; (2) receive, process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis; (3) manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and (4) process payments to suppliers. in europe, celesio outsources a significant part of its it infrastructure to an external service provider. if these systems are interrupted, damaged or breached by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party, including a cyber attack, or fail for any extended period of time, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. if we sustain cyber attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. we routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the u.s. due to our information technology systems and international business operations. we may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. our systems and the data we store on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; misplaced or lost data; human errors; or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customer's data. the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers. in addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties, could expose our customers' private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance. in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment's customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. one or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 20 table of contents mckesson corporation our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses (which include care management programs and our nurse advice services) and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management's attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient. we also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. in addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the acquisition of celesio exposes us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services. pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. although celesio maintains liability insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims. if celesio's insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or celesio suffers reputational harm as a result of an error or omission, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations. our healthcare technology businesses, the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment, deliver enterprise wide and single entity clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain and strategic management software solutions to hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail and mail order pharmacies and payers. challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment. future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses. such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete. the success of our technology businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to be responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing business models. to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace, our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis. the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers, and thereby could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties. we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or solutions that are equivalent or superior to ours. in addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. although we believe that our products, solutions and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. if we were found to be infringing others' rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing products or technology, obtain a license or cease selling or using the products that contain the infringing elements. additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. these litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 21 table of contents mckesson corporation system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. the software and technology services that we sell or operate are complex. as with complex systems offered by others, our software and technology services may contain errors, especially when first introduced. for example, our technology solutions segment's systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care. therefore, users of our software and technology services have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. if our software and technology services lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients, clinicians or patients. in addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales. failure of a customer's system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages. various risks could interrupt customers' access to their data residing in our service center, exposing us to significant costs. we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers. the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers. our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; and (4) cyber attacks, computer viruses, hacking and other similar disruptive problems. we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change controls, information security procedures, and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security, but our precautions may not protect against all risks. if customers' access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. if customers' access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our contractors or third party service providers, we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services. the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our technology solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles, which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation. how and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer. any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue. 22 table of contents mckesson corporation we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. we are required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) to test our goodwill for impairment, annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a divestiture indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. there are inherent uncertainties in management's estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. from time-to-time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation. for example, if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes, it would adversely impact our cash flow. additionally, if legislation is passed to change the current u.s. taxation treatment of income from foreign operations, or if legislation is passed at the state level to establish or increase taxation on the basis of our gross revenues, it may adversely impact our tax expense. the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. for example, we operate in various countries which collect value added taxes ( vat ). the determination of the manner in which a vat applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws and regulations. although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements. although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. additionally, if customers' or suppliers' operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. 23 table of contents mckesson corporation changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ), the international accounting standards board ( iasb ) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements. our financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. within our financial statements, we consolidate the results of celesio, which are subject to the application of international financial reporting standards or ifrs. from time-to-time we or celesio are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb, iasb and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate or one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities. we participate in various multiemployer pension plans. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make additional cash contributions to the plans in installments. our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. the multiemployer plans could have significant unfunded vested liabilities. such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. in addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk: our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. at march 31, 2015, we had $0.7 billion in outstanding debt with variable interest rates. our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. at march 31, 2015, we had $5.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. the effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2015 and 2014 of approximately $19 million and $12 million. foreign exchange risk: the majority of our operations are conducted in u. s. dollars; however, certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expense and purchasing activities are incurred in and exposed to other currencies. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. these contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency loans. these contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign currency rate risk. as of march 31, 2015 and 2014, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $223 million and $134 million. however, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. refer to financial note 19, hedging activities, for more information on our foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. the selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. 50 table of contents mckesson corporation
