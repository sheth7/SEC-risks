statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 . management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. 6 table of contents additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our net sales, profit results and cash flow are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, spending patterns and market disruptions. our net sales, profit, cash flows and future growth may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers' ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. in addition, market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels. in particular, our operating results are impacted by factors in the u.s. and canadian economies. purchases of women's intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our net sales, operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space. most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those retail areas. our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including destination retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from other retail and non-retail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores. part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel, particularly at the store management level, and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our results and reputation. we intend to further expand into international markets through license and franchise agreements and/or company-owned stores. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. further, entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. 7 table of contents we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners as licensees, franchisees or in a similar capacity. in addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales. we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets. in addition, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. more specifically, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our earnings and our financial condition. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our licensees and franchisees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by licensees and franchisees ( partners ). although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners, the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully. these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our direct channel business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on our results. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. risks include, but are not limited to, the (a) diversion of sales from our stores, which may impact comparable store sales figures, (b) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels, (c) domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside our control, (d) the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate the websites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, and (e) risks related to the fulfillment of direct-to-consumer orders. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. our failure to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. if any third-party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results. the sale of women's intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through direct response channels. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and direct response channels. 8 table of contents some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. in many cases, our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls. increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands. our success depends in part on management's ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries. we purchase merchandise directly in foreign markets and in our domestic market. many of our imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as: political instability; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; legal and regulatory matters; volatility in currency exchange rates; local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and related pricing impacts; disruption of imports by labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation. new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries. in addition, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity. our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk. our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. in addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and would increase our interest expense. the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for 9 table of contents our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, changes to our credit rating would affect our interest costs. we may be unable to service our debt. some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements. our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments. if our cash flow from operations declines, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt. we may be unable to retain key personnel. we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including leslie h. wexner (chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer). the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. we may be unable to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store personnel and talented merchants. the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards. we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. factors outside our control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. in addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in product input costs. product input costs, including manufacturing labor and raw materials, fluctuate. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs. we may not be able to, or may elect not to, pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs. energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers. a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable 10 table of contents to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we self-insure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience. we are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers' compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our information technology systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores or impact our consumers ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, we will make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements. as a public company, we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations, including those required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the sec and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ). failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by changes in taxation requirements. we are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. in addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. fluctuations in tax rates and duties and changes in tax legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters. we along with our third-party business partners are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. actions filed against our company from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. difficulty can exist in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations that affect how we operate. in addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 60 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. we use derivative financial instruments like the cross-currency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 60 table of contents foreign exchange rate risk to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our investment in la senza associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. these cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate u.s. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and u.s. dollar principal payments upon maturity. the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans. as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related cross-currency swaps, we do not believe there is any material translation risk to la senza's net earnings associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate. in addition, our canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada is sourced through u.s. dollar transactions. interest rate risk our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. currently, our investment portfolio is comprised of u.s. and canadian government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, bank time deposits, and highly-rated commercial paper. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. all of our long-term debt as of january 28, 2012 has fixed interest rates. we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate. the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the three-month london interbank offered rate ("libor"). as of january 28, 2012 , our designated fair value hedges have a notional amount of $175 million related to a portion of our 2017 notes. for the balance of our long-term debt that is not subject to the interest rate swap arrangements, our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. fair value of financial instruments as of january 28, 2012 , management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables 61 table of contents approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. the following table provides a summary of the carrying value and fair value of long-term debt and swap arrangements as of january 28, 2012 and january 29, 2011 : january 28, 2012 january 29, 2011 (in millions) long-term debt: carrying value $ 3,538 $ 2,507 fair value, estimated (a) (b) 3,849 2,638 cross-currency swap arrangements (c) (d) 60 57 fixed-to-floating interest rate swap arrangements (c) (e) (14 ) (3 ) ________________ (a) the estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt is based on quoted market prices. the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. (b) the increase in the estimated fair value of our long-term debt reflects the march 2011 issuance of $1 billion notes due in april 2021 and increases in the estimated fair value of our remaining long-term debt. (c) swap arrangements are in an (asset) liability position. (d) the change in fair value of the cross-currency swap arrangements from january 29, 2011 to january 28, 2012 is primarily due to the fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate. 62 table of contents (e) the balance at january 29, 2011 represents multiple interest rate swap arrangements entered into during 2010 related to various outstanding notes to effectively convert the fixed interest rate on the related debt to a variable interest rate based on three-month london interbank offered rate plus a fixed interest rate. the balance at january 28, 2012 only includes the interest rate swap arrangements related to our outstanding 2017 notes as all others had been terminated in 2011. concentration of credit risk we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. currently, our investment portfolio is comprised of u.s. and canadian government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, bank time deposits, and highly-rated commercial paper. we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions and other entities with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. we also monitor the creditworthiness of entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and counterparties to derivative instruments. 63 table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk factors.

to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 . management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our net sales, profit results and cash flow are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, spending patterns and market disruptions. our net sales, profit, cash flows and future growth may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers' ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. in addition, market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels. in particular, our operating results are impacted by factors in the u.s., canadian and u.k. economies. purchases of women's intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our net sales, operating income, cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space. most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those retail areas. our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including destination retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from other retail and non-retail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores. part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 7 table of contents our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel, particularly at the store management level, and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our results and reputation. we intend to further expand into international markets through license and franchise agreements and/or company-owned stores. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. further, entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners as licensees, franchisees or in a similar capacity. in addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales. we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets. in addition, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. more specifically, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our earnings and our financial condition. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our licensees and franchisees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by licensees and franchisees ( partners ). although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners, the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully. these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our direct channel businesses includes risks that could have an adverse effect on our results. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. risks include, but are not limited to, the (a) diversion of sales from our stores, which may impact comparable store sales figures, (b) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels, (c) domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside our control, (d) the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate the websites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, and (e) risks related to the fulfillment of direct-to-consumer orders. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. 8 table of contents our failure to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or app lied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. if any third-party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results. the sale of women's intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through direct response channels. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and direct response channels. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. in many cases, our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls. increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands. our success depends in part on management's ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by our inability to adequately source, distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis. we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market. we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores. many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis, such as: political instability; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports; legal and regulatory matters; volatility in currency exchange rates; local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts; disruption of production or distribution due to labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation. 9 table of contents new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, could impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such countries. in addition, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity of international markets. our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. in addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense. the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, changes to our credit rating could affect our interest costs. we may be unable to service or refinance our debt. some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements. our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments. if our cash flow from operations declines, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt. we may be unable to retain key personnel. we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including leslie h. wexner (chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer). the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. we may be unable to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store personnel and talented merchants. the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards. we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. factors outside our control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. in addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation 10 table of contents with existing and potential customers and our brand image. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in product input costs. product input costs, including manufacturing labor and raw materials, fluctuate. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs. we may not be able to, or may elect not to, pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs. energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers. a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we self-insure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience. we are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers' compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our information technology systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores or impact our consumers ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, we will make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements. we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations, including those required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the foreign corrupt practices act, the sec and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ). failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 11 table of contents we may be adversely impacted by changes in taxation requirements. we are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. in addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. fluctuations in tax rates and duties and changes in tax legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters. we along with our third-party business partners are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. actions filed against our company from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. difficulty can exist in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations that affect how we operate. in addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. we use derivative financial instruments like the cross-currency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign exchange rate risk to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our canadian operations associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. these cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate u.s. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and u.s. dollar principal payments upon maturity. the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans. as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related cross-currency swaps, we do not believe there is any material translation risk to our canadian net earnings associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate. in addition, our canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada is sourced through u.s. dollar transactions. interest rate risk our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. currently, our investment portfolio is comprised of u.s. and canadian government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, bank time deposits, and highly-rated commercial paper. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. all of our long-term debt as of february 2, 2013 has fixed interest rates. our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. as of february 2, 2013 , we have no outstanding interest rate swap arrangements related to our long-term debt. fair value of financial instruments as of february 2, 2013 , management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. the following table provides a summary of the carrying value and fair value of long-term debt and swap arrangements as of february 2, 2013 and january 28, 2012 : february 2, 2013 january 28, 2012 (in millions) long-term debt (a): carrying value $ 4,477 $ 3,538 fair value, estimated (b) 5,023 3,849 cross-currency swap arrangements (c) 59 60 fixed-to-floating interest rate swap arrangements (c) (14 ) ________________ (a) the increase in the long-term debt is related to the issuance of the february 2022 notes. (b) the estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices. the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. (c) swap arrangements are in an (asset) liability position. 51 table of contents concentration of credit risk we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. currently, our investment portfolio is comprised of u.s. and canadian government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, bank time deposits and highly rated commercial paper. we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. 52 table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk

and our ability to keep up with fashion trends, develop new merchandise and launch new product lines successfully; our ability to source, distribute and sell goods and materials on a global basis, including risks related to: political instability; duties, taxes and other charges; legal and regulatory matters; volatility in currency exchange rates; local business practices and political issues; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts; disruption due to labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation;

forward-looking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 . management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our net sales, profit results and cash flow are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, spending patterns and weather or other market disruptions. our net sales, profit, cash flows and future growth may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers' ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. in addition, market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels. in particular, our operating results are impacted by factors in the u.s., canadian and u.k. economies. purchases of women's intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located, particularly in markets where we have multiple stores, could adversely affect our business. for example, heavy snowfall, rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. for example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our net sales, operating income, cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space. most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those retail areas. our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including destination retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from other retail and non-retail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores. 7 table of contents part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our results and reputation. we intend to further expand into international markets through license and franchise agreements and/or company-owned stores. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. further, entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners as licensees, franchisees or in a similar capacity. in addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales. we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets. in addition, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our licensees, franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by licensees, franchisees and wholesalers ( partners ). although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners, the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully. these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our direct channel businesses includes risks that could have an adverse effect on our results. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. risks include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels; domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside our control; the maintenance and security of the internet infrastructure; the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our websites and the related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions; and risks related to the fulfillment of direct-to-consumer orders such as not adequately predicting customer demand or otherwise failing to maintain efficient and uninterrupted order-taking and fulfillment operations. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 8 table of contents our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. our failure to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. if any third-party copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results. the sale of women's intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and online channels. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. in many cases, our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls. increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands. our success depends in part on management's ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by our inability to adequately source, distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis. we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market. we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores. many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis, such as: political instability; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports; 9 table of contents legal and regulatory matters; volatility in currency exchange rates; local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts; disruption due to labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation. new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, could impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such countries. in addition, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity of international markets. our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets, and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results. as a result, the fluctuation in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. in addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense. the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, changes to our credit rating could affect our interest costs. we may be unable to service or refinance our debt. some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements. our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments. if our cash flow from operations declines, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt. we may be unable to retain key personnel. we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including leslie h. wexner, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. 10 table of contents we may be unable to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor-related costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store personnel and talented merchants. the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor-related costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards. we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. factors outside our control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. in addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in product input costs. product input costs, including manufacturing labor and raw materials, fluctuate. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs. we may not be able to, or may elect not to, pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs. energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers. a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we self-insure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience. we are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers' compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our information technology systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. the increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational 11 table of contents risks. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores or impact our consumers' ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, we will make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. our failure to maintain the security of customer, associate, supplier or company information could have a negative impact on our reputation and our results. information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation, cause the disclosure of confidential customer, associate, supplier or company information, cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal, regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues. while we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to secured data and prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements. we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations, including those required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the foreign corrupt practices act, the sec and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ). failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by changes in taxation requirements. we are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. in addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. fluctuations in tax rates and duties, changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters. we, along with our third-party business partners, are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. actions filed against our company from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. difficulty can exist in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations that affect how we operate. in addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. we use derivative financial instruments like the cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign exchange rate risk we have operations in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our canadian operations associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. these cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate u.s. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and u.s. dollar principal payments upon maturity. the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans. as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related cross-currency swaps, we do not believe there is any material translation risk to our canadian net earnings associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate. in addition, our canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada and the u.k. is sourced through u.s. dollar transactions. we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset these risks. interest rate risk our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. currently, our investment portfolio is comprised of u.s. government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, highly-rated commercial paper and bank deposits. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. all of our long-term debt as of february 1, 2014 has fixed interest rates. we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. as of february 1, 2014 , we have interest rate swap arrangements with notional amounts of $200 million related to a portion of our 2017 notes and $200 million related to a portion of our 2019 notes. the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate. the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the three-month london interbank offered rate ("libor"). 50 table of contents for the balance of our long-term debt that is not subject to interest rate swap arrangements, our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. fair value of financial instruments as of february 1, 2014 , management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. the following table provides a summary of the carrying value and fair value of long-term debt and swap arrangements as of february 1, 2014 and february 2, 2013 : february 1, 2014 february 2, 2013 (in millions) long-term debt (a): carrying value $ 4,976 $ 4,477 fair value, estimated (b) 5,333 5,023 cross-currency swap arrangements (c) 13 59 fixed-to-floating interest rate swap arrangements (c) (5 ) ________________ (a) the increase in the long-term debt is related to the issuance of the october 2023 notes. (b) the estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices. the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. (c) swap arrangements are in an (asset) liability position. concentration of credit risk we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. 51 table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk factors. we caution that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995) contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. accordingly, our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward-looking statements. words such as estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, planned, potential and any similar expressions may identify

locations on appropriate terms; our ability to grow through new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions; our ability to successfully expand into global markets and related risks; our relationships with independent franchise, license and wholesale partners; our direct channel businesses; our failure to protect our reputation and our brand images; our failure to protect our trade names, trademarks and patents; the highly competitive nature of the retail industry generally and the segments in which we operate particularly; consumer acceptance of our products and our ability to keep up with fashion trends, develop new merchandise and launch new product lines successfully; our ability to source, distribute and sell goods and materials on a global basis, including risks related to: political instability; duties, taxes and other charges; legal and regulatory matters; volatility in currency exchange rates; local business practices and political issues; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts; disruption due to labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; stock price volatility; our failure to maintain our credit rating; our ability to service or refinance our debt; our ability to retain key personnel; our ability to

regulatory requirements; tax matters; and legal and compliance matters. we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 . management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our net sales, profit results and cash flow are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, spending patterns and weather or other market disruptions. our net sales, profit, cash flows and future growth may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers' ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. in addition, market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels. purchases of women's intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located, particularly in markets where we have multiple stores, could adversely affect our business. for example, heavy snowfall, rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. our net sales, operating income, cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space. most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those retail areas. our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including destination retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from other retail and non-retail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores. part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 7 table of contents our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our results and reputation. we intend to further expand into international markets through partner arrangements and/or company-owned stores. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. further, entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners. in addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law. we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets. in addition, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our licensees, franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners. although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners, the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited, and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially, and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully. these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an adverse effect on our results. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. risks include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels; domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control; the maintenance and security of the internet infrastructure; our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs; the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our websites and the related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions; and risks related to the fulfillment of direct-to-consumer orders such as not adequately predicting customer demand. our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted order-taking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results. the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise. if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities, or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire or other natural disaster or work stoppage, we could face shortages of inventory; incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers; and cause customer dissatisfaction. any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. 8 table of contents our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to maintain the security of customer, associate, supplier or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. our failure to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. if any third-party copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results. the sale of women's intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and online channels. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. in many cases, our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls. increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands. our success depends in part on management's ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by our inability to adequately source, distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis. we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market. we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores. many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis, such as: political instability; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports; 9 table of contents legal and regulatory matters; volatility in currency exchange rates; local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts; disruption due to labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation or other factors. we also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution centers, our stores and to our customers. our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact our transportation providers' ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, could impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such countries. in addition, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity of international markets. our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets, and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. in addition, our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results. as a result, the fluctuation in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. in addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense. the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, changes to our credit rating could affect our interest costs. we may be unable to service or refinance our debt. some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements. our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments. if our cash flow from operations declines, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt. 10 table of contents we may be unable to recruit, train and retain key personnel. we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including leslie h. wexner, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. we may be unable to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor-related costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store personnel and talented merchants. the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor-related costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards. we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. factors outside our control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. in addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in product input costs. product input costs, including manufacturing labor and raw materials, fluctuate. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs. we may not be able to, or may elect not to, pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs. energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers. a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we self-insure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience. we are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers' compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 11 table of contents we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our information technology systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. the increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores or impact our consumers' ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, from time to time, we make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may fail to maintain the security of customer, associate, supplier or company information which could have a negative impact on our reputation and our results. information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation with our customers, employees, investors and other third parties; cause the disclosure of confidential customer, associate, supplier or company information; cause our customers to stop shopping with us; and result in significant legal, regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues. while we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. in addition to our own networks and databases, we use third-party service providers to store, process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems. we have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks. despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or similar events. the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees and engaging consultants. additionally, we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cybersecurity breach. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements. we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations, including those required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, the sec and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ). failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 12 table of contents we may be adversely impacted by changes in taxation requirements. we are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. in addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. fluctuations in tax rates and duties, changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters. we, along with third parties we do business with, are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. actions filed against our company from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. difficulty can exist in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations that affect how we operate. in addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. we use derivative financial instruments like cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign exchange rate risk we have operations in foreign countries, which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our canadian operations associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. these cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate u.s. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and u.s. dollar principal payments upon maturity. the remaining swap arrangements mature in january 2016 and january 2018 at the same time as the related loans. as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related cross-currency swaps, we do not believe there is any material translation risk to our canadian net earnings associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate. in addition, our canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada and the u.k. is sourced through u.s. dollar transactions. although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset these risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates. further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in u.s. dollars, the royalties we receive in u.s. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency. as a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. interest rate risk our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. currently, our investment portfolio is comprised of u.s. government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, highly rated commercial paper and bank deposits. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. all of our long-term debt as of january 31, 2015 has fixed interest rates. we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. as of january 31, 2015 , we have interest rate swap arrangements with notional amounts of $300 million related to a portion of our 2017 notes and $300 million related to a portion of our 2019 notes. the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate. the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the three-month libor. for the balance of our long-term debt that is not subject to interest rate swap arrangements, our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. fair value of financial instruments as of january 31, 2015 , management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. 51 table of contents the following table provides a summary of the carrying value and fair value of long-term debt and swap arrangements as of january 31, 2015 and february 1, 2014 : january 31, 2015 february 1, 2014 (in millions) long-term debt (a): carrying value $ 4,765 $ 4,976 fair value, estimated (b) 5,305 5,333 cross-currency swap arrangements (c) (21 ) 13 fixed-to-floating interest rate swap arrangements (c) (12 ) (5 ) ________________ (a) the decrease in the long-term debt is related to the repayment of the november 2014 notes. (b) the estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices. the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. (c) swap arrangements are in an (asset) liability position. concentration of credit risk we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. 52 table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk factors. we caution that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995) contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks

obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 . management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our net sales, profit results and cash flows are sensitive to, and may be affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, spending patterns, weather or other market disruptions. our net sales, profit, cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers' ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. in addition, market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels. purchases of women's intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located, particularly in markets where we have multiple stores, could adversely affect our business. for example, heavy snowfall, rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. our net sales, operating income, cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space. most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those retail areas. our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including destination retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control, such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area, competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do 7 table of contents not have stores, the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators of the shopping areas or developers in which our stores are located. part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. some of our store locations, such as our victoria's secret flagship stores, require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments. additionally, we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use. the leases that we enter into are generally non-cancelable leases with initial terms of ten years. if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation. we intend to further expand into international markets, including mainland china and other international markets, through partner arrangements and/or company-owned stores. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. further, entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance. we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners. in addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law. we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets. further, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. see fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations below. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our licensees, franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners. although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners, the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited, and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. for example, our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially, and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully. these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. risks include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels; domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control; our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in 8 table of contents technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs; the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure, websites and the related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions; and risks related to the fulfillment of direct-to-consumer orders such as not adequately predicting customer demand. our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted order-taking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results. the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise. if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities, or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire or other natural disaster or work stoppage, we could face shortages of inventory; incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers; and cause customer dissatisfaction. any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity, including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs, websites and other forums, may affect our reputation and brand and, consequently, reduce demand for our merchandise, even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate. failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to maintain the security of customer, associate, supplier or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. if our marketing, advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected. customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising, marketing and promotional activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores. although we use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media including television, social media, database marketing and print, some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. our ability to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. in particular, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. if any third-party copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results. the sale of women's intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and online channels. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. in many cases, our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers. 9 table of contents increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands. our success depends in part on management's ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source, distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis. we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market. we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores. many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis. for example: political instability, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters which could negatively affect international economies, financial markets and business activity; imposition of new or retaliatory trade duties, sanctions or taxes and other charges on imports or exports; evolving or complex legal and regulatory matters; volatility in currency exchange rates; local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts; disruption due to labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation or other factors. we also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution centers, our stores and to our customers. our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact our transportation providers' ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we rely on a number of supplier and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity, making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions. to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty, personal care and home fragrance products, we rely heavily on supplier and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio. as a result of geographic concentration of the supplier and distribution facilities that we rely upon, our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as accidents, system failures, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes, and other unforeseen events and circumstances. any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 10 table of contents fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. in addition, our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results. as a result, the fluctuation in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. in addition, the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors may, at its discretion, decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense. the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs. we may be impacted by our ability to service or refinance our debt. we currently have substantial indebtedness. some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements. our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments. if our cash flow from operations declines, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt. we may be impacted by our ability to recruit, train and retain key personnel. we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including leslie h. wexner, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. we may be impacted by our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor-related costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store personnel and talented merchants. the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these 11 table of contents positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor-related costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our manufacturers' ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner, meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations. we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. factors outside our control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. in addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image. our business could also suffer if our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our employees periodically visit and monitor the operations of our third-party manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their practices. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by a third-party manufacturer used by us, or the divergence of a third-party manufacturer's or partner's labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment or finished products to us or damage our reputation. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs. product input costs, including manufacturing, freight, labor and raw materials, fluctuate. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs. we may not be able to, or may elect not to, pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs. energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers. a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we self-insure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience. we are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers' compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 12 table of contents we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our information technology systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. the increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores, impact our consumers' ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, from time to time, we make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to maintain the security of customer, associate, supplier or company information could have an impact on our reputation and our results. information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation with our customers, employees, investors and other third parties; cause the disclosure of confidential customer, associate, supplier or company information; cause our customers to stop shopping with us; and result in significant legal, regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues. while we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. in addition to our own networks and databases, we use third-party service providers to store, process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems. we have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks. despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or similar events. the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees and engaging consultants. additionally, we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cybersecurity breach. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements. we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations, including those required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, the sec and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ), among others. although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, subcontractors, vendors, licensees, franchisees and suppliers could take actions that violate these laws and regulations. any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 13 table of contents it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations. also, changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. for example, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. it may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations. we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters. we, along with third parties we do business with, are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims, whether by settlement or adverse court decision, may harm our business. further, potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us. we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits, but if the outcome were negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by changes in taxation requirements. we are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. in addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. fluctuations in tax rates and duties, changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. we use derivative financial instruments like cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign exchange rate risk we have operations in foreign countries, which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our canadian operations associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a cross-currency swap related to a canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan. this cross-currency swap requires the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate u.s. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and u.s. dollar principal payments upon maturity. the swap arrangement matures in january 2018 at the same time as the related loan. as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan and the related cross-currency swap, we do not believe there is any material translation risk to our canadian net earnings associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate. in addition, our canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada and the u.k. is sourced through u.s. dollar transactions. although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset these risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates. further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in u.s. dollars, the royalties we receive in u.s. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency. as a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. interest rate risk our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. currently, our investment portfolio is comprised of u.s. government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, highly rated commercial paper and bank 51 table of contents deposits. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. all of our long-term debt as of january 30, 2016 has fixed interest rates. we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. as of january 30, 2016 , we have interest rate swap arrangements with notional amounts of $300 million related to a portion of our 2017 notes and $300 million related to a portion of our 2019 notes. the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate. the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the three-month libor. for the balance of our long-term debt that is not subject to interest rate swap arrangements, our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. fair value of financial instruments as of january 30, 2016 , management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. the following table provides a summary of the principal value and fair value of long-term debt and swap arrangements as of january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015 : january 30, 2016 january 31, 2015 (in millions) long-term debt (a): principal value $ 5,750 $ 4,750 fair value, estimated (b) 6,209 5,305 cross-currency swap arrangements (c) (27 ) (21 ) fixed-to-floating interest rate swap arrangements (c) (11 ) (12 ) ________________ (a) the increase in the long-term debt is related to the october 2015 issuance of $1 billion notes due in november 2035. (b) the estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices. the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. (c) swap arrangements are in an asset position. concentration of credit risk we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. 52 table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk factors. we caution that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995) contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. accordingly, our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward-looking statements. words such as estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, planned, potential and any similar expressions may identify

any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 . management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our net sales, profit results and cash flows are sensitive to, and may be affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, spending patterns, weather or other market disruptions. our net sales, profit, cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers' ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. in addition, market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels. purchases of women's intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the decision by the u.k. to leave the european union ("brexit") has increased the uncertainty in the economic and political environment in europe. in particular, our business in the united kingdom may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws. extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located, particularly in markets where we have multiple stores, could adversely affect our business. for example, heavy snowfall, rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. our net sales, operating income, cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 7 table of contents our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space. most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those retail areas. our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including destination retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control, such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area, competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores, the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators of the shopping areas or developers in which our stores are located. part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. some of our store locations, such as our victoria's secret flagship stores, require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments. additionally, we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use. the leases that we enter into are generally noncancellable leases with initial terms of ten years. if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation. we intend to further expand into international markets, including mainland china and other international markets, through partner arrangements and/or company-owned stores. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. further, entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, volatility in the geopolitical landscape, restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance. we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners. in addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law. we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets. further, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. see fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations below. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 8 table of contents our licensees, franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners. although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners, the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited, and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. for example, our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially, and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully. these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. risks include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels; domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control; our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs; the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure, websites and the related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions; and risks related to the fulfillment of direct-to-consumer orders such as not adequately predicting customer demand. our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted order-taking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results. the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise. if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities, or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire or other natural disaster or work stoppage, we could face shortages of inventory; incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers; and cause customer dissatisfaction. any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity, including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs, websites and other forums, may affect our reputation and brand and, consequently, reduce demand for our merchandise, even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate. failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to maintain the security of customer, associate, supplier or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. if our marketing, advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected. customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising, marketing and promotional activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores. although we use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media including television, social media, database marketing and print, some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. our ability to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. in particular, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the u.s. if any third party copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a 9 table of contents material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results. the sale of women's intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and online channels. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. in many cases, our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers. increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to manage the life cycle of our brands and to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands. our success depends in part on management's ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brands and to anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source, distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis. we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market. we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores. many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis. for example: political instability, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters which could negatively affect international economies, financial markets and business activity; imposition of new or retaliatory trade duties, sanctions or taxes and other charges on imports or exports; evolving, new or complex legal and regulatory matters; volatility in currency exchange rates; local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts; disruption due to labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation or other factors. we also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution centers, to our stores and to our customers. our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and associate strikes and inclement weather, which may impact our transportation providers' ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. 10 table of contents our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we rely on a number of supplier and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity, making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions. to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty, personal care and home fragrance products, we rely heavily on supplier and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio. as a result of geographic concentration of the supplier and distribution facilities that we rely upon, our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as accidents, system failures, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes, and other unforeseen events and circumstances. any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. in addition, our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results. as a result, the fluctuation in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. in addition, the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors may, at its discretion, decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and our stock price. our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense. the credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs. we may be impacted by our ability to service or refinance our debt. we currently have substantial indebtedness. some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements. our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments. if our cash flow from operations declines, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt. 11 table of contents we may be impacted by our ability to recruit, train and retain key personnel. we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including leslie h. wexner, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. we may be impacted by our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified associates and manage labor-related costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates, including store personnel and talented merchants. the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in labor-related costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our manufacturers' ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner, meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations. we purchase products from third-party manufacturers. factors outside our control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. in addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image. our business could also suffer if our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates periodically visit and monitor the operations of our third-party manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their practices. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by a third-party manufacturer used by us, or the divergence of a third-party manufacturer's or partner's labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs. product input costs, including manufacturing, freight, labor and raw materials, fluctuate. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs. we may not be able to, or may elect not to, pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft. our assets are subject to loss, including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates, customers, vendors or unaffiliated third parties. we have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past, and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses. higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs. energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers. a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 12 table of contents we may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we self-insure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience. we are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers' compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our information technology systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. the increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores, impact our consumers' ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, from time to time, we make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to maintain the security of customer, associate, supplier or company information could have an impact on our reputation and our results. information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation with our customers, associates, investors and other third parties; cause the disclosure of confidential customer, associate, supplier or company information; cause our customers to stop shopping with us; and result in significant legal, regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues. while we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. in addition to our own networks and databases, we use third-party service providers to store, process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems. we have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks. despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or similar events. the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training associates and engaging consultants. additionally, we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cybersecurity breach. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 13 table of contents we may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements. we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations, including those required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, the sec and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ), among others. although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our associates, subcontractors, vendors, licensees, franchisees and suppliers could take actions that violate these laws and regulations. any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations. also, changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. for example, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. it may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations. we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters. we, along with third parties we do business with, are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims, whether by settlement or adverse court decision, may harm our business. further, potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us. we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits, but if the outcome were negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by changes in taxation, trade and other regulatory requirements. we are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. in addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. fluctuations in tax rates and duties, changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. there is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the u.s. and other countries. major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. we use derivative financial instruments like cross-currency swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign exchange rate risk we have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our canadian operations associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a cross-currency swap related to a canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan. this cross-currency swap requires the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate u.s. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and u.s. dollar principal payments upon maturity. the swap arrangement matures in january 2018 at the same time as the related loan. as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan and the related cross-currency swap, we do not believe there is any material translation risk to our canadian net earnings associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate. in addition, our canadian dollar, british pound, chinese yuan and hong kong dollar denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada, the u.k. and greater china is sourced through u.s. dollar transactions. although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates. further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in u.s. dollars, the royalties we receive in u.s. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency. as a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. interest rate risk our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. typically, our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of u.s. government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. the majority of our long-term debt as of january 28, 2017 has fixed interest rates. we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. as of january 28, 2017 , we have interest rate swap arrangements with notional amounts of $300 million related to a portion of our 2019 notes. the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate. the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the three-month libor. 50 table of contents for the balance of our long-term debt that is not subject to interest rate swap arrangements, our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. fair value of financial instruments as of january 28, 2017 , we believe that the carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximate fair value because of their short maturity. the following table provides a summary of the principal value and fair value of long-term debt and swap arrangements as of january 28, 2017 and january 30, 2016 : january 28, 2017 january 30, 2016 (in millions) long-term debt: principal value $ 5,750 $ 5,750 fair value, estimated (a) 6,030 6,209 foreign currency cash flow hedges (b) (17 ) (27 ) interest rate fair value hedges (b) (2 ) (11 ) ________________ (a) the estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices. the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. (b) hedge arrangements are in a net asset position. concentration of credit risk we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. typically, our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of u.s. government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. 51 table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk factors. we caution that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995) contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. accordingly, our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward-looking statements. words such as estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, planned, potential and any similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements. risks

materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management: general economic conditions, consumer confidence, consumer spending patterns and market disruptions including severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards, terrorist activities, financial crises, political crises or other major events, or the prospect of these events; the seasonality of our business; the dependence on mall traffic and the availability of suitable store locations on appropriate terms; our ability to

in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 . management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our net sales, profit results and cash flows are sensitive to, and may be affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, spending patterns, weather or other market disruptions. our net sales, profit, cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers' ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. in addition, market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels. purchases of women's intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the decision by the u.k. to leave the european union ( brexit ) has increased the uncertainty in the economic and political environment in europe. in particular, our business in the u.k. may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws. extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located, particularly in markets where we have multiple stores, could adversely affect our business. for example, heavy snowfall, rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. our net sales, operating income, cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 7 table of contents our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space. most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those retail areas. our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including destination retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control, such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area, consumer trends away from brick-and-mortar retail toward online shopping, competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores, the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators of the shopping areas or developers in which our stores are located. part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. some of our store locations, such as our victoria's secret flagship stores, require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments. additionally, we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use. the leases that we enter into are generally noncancellable leases with initial terms of ten years. if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation. we intend to further expand into international markets, including mainland china, through partner arrangements and/or company-owned stores. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. further, entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, volatility in the geopolitical landscape, restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance. we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners. in addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law. we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets. further, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. see fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations below. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our licensees, franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners. although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners, the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. for example, our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer 8 table of contents materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully. these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. risks include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels; domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control; our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs; the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure, websites and the related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions; and risks related to the fulfillment of direct-to-consumer orders such as not adequately predicting customer demand. our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted order-taking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results. the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise. if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities, or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire, natural disaster or work stoppage, we could face shortages of inventory; incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers; and cause customer dissatisfaction. any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity, including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs, websites and other forums, may affect our reputation and brand and, consequently, reduce demand for our merchandise, even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate. failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to maintain the security of customer, associate, third-party or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. if our marketing, advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected. customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising, marketing and promotional activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores. although we use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including social media, websites, mobile applications, email, print and television, some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. our ability to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. in particular, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the u.s. if any third-party copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 9 table of contents our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results. the sale of women's intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and online channels. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. in many cases, our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers. increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to manage the life cycle of our brands and to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands. our success depends in part on management's ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brands and to anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source, distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis. we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market. we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores. many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis. for example: political instability, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters which could negatively affect international economies, financial markets and business activity; imposition of new or retaliatory trade duties, sanctions or taxes and other charges on imports or exports; evolving, new or complex legal and regulatory matters; volatility in currency exchange rates; local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts; disruption due to labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation or other factors. we also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution centers, to our stores and to our customers. our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and associate strikes and inclement weather, which may impact our transportation providers' ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 10 table of contents we rely on a number of vendor and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity, making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions. to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty, personal care and home fragrance products, we rely heavily on vendor and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio. as a result of geographic concentration of the vendor and distribution facilities that we rely upon, our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as accidents, system failures, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes, and other unforeseen events and circumstances. any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. in addition, our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term negative impacts of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results. as a result, the fluctuation in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. in addition, the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors may, at its discretion, decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and our stock price. our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense. the credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs. we may be impacted by our ability to service or refinance our debt. we currently have substantial indebtedness. some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements. our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments. if our cash flow from operations declines, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt. 11 table of contents we may be impacted by our ability to recruit, train and retain key personnel. we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including leslie h. wexner, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. we may be impacted by our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified associates and manage labor-related costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates, including store personnel and talented merchants. the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in labor-related costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our vendors' ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner, meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations. we purchase products from third-party vendors. factors outside our control, such as production or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. in addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image. our business could also suffer if our third-party vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates visit and monitor the operations of our third-party vendors, we do not control these vendors or their practices. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by third-party vendors used by us, or the divergence of a third-party vendor's or partner's labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs. product input costs, including freight, labor and raw materials, fluctuate. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs. we may not be able to, or may elect not to, pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft. our assets are subject to loss, including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates, customers, vendors or unaffiliated third parties. we have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past, and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses. higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs. energy costs have fluctuated in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers. a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 12 table of contents we may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we self-insure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience. we are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers' compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our information technology systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. the increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores, impact our consumers' ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information, merchandise, financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, from time to time, we make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to maintain the security of customer, associate, third-party or company information could have an impact on our reputation and our results. information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation with our customers, associates, investors and other third parties; cause the disclosure of confidential customer, associate, third-party or company information; cause our customers to stop shopping with us; and result in significant legal, regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues. while we train our associates and have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. in addition to our own networks and databases, we use third-party service providers to store, process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems. we have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks. despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or similar events. the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training associates and engaging consultants. additionally, we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cybersecurity breach. 13 table of contents these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements. we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations, including those required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, the sec and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ), among others. although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our associates, subcontractors, vendors, licensees, franchisees and other third parties could take actions that violate these laws and regulations. any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations. also, changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. for example, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. it may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations. we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters. we, along with third parties we do business with, are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims, whether by settlement or adverse court decision, may harm our business. further, potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us. we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits, but if the outcome were negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, the market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by changes in taxation, trade and other regulatory requirements. we are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. in addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. fluctuations in tax rates and duties, changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. there is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the u.s. and other countries. major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. we may use derivative financial instruments like cross-currency swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign exchange rate risk we have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. our canadian dollar, british pound, chinese yuan, hong kong dollar and euro denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada, the u.k., ireland and greater china is sourced through u.s. dollar transactions. although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates. further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in u.s. dollars, the royalties we receive in u.s. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency. as a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. interest rate risk our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. typically, our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of u.s. government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. 50 table of contents all of our long-term debt as of february 3, 2018 has fixed interest rates. we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. fair value of financial instruments as of february 3, 2018 , we believe that the carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximate fair value because of their short maturity. the following table provides a summary of the principal value and fair value of long-term debt, excluding foreign borrowings, and swap arrangements as of february 3, 2018 and january 28, 2017 : february 3, 2018 january 28, 2017 (in millions) long-term debt: principal value $ 5,750 $ 5,750 fair value, estimated (a) 5,943 6,030 foreign currency cash flow hedges (b) 9 (17 ) interest rate fair value hedges (b) (2 ) ________________ (a) the estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices. the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. (b) hedge arrangements are in a net liability (asset) position. concentration of credit risk we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. typically, our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of u.s. government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. 51 table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk factors. we caution that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995) contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. accordingly, our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward-looking statements. words such as estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, planned, potential and any similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements. risks associated with the following factors, among others, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management: general economic conditions, consumer confidence, consumer spending patterns and market disruptions including severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards, terrorist activities, financial crises, political crises or other major events, or the prospect of these events; the seasonality of our business; the dependence on mall traffic and the availability of suitable store locations on appropriate terms; our ability to

and theft; fluctuations in energy costs; increases in the costs of mailing, paper and printing; claims arising from our self-insurance; liabilities arising from divested businesses; our ability to implement and maintain information technology systems and to protect associated data; our ability to maintain the security of customer, associate, third-party or company information; our ability to comply with regulatory requirements; legal and compliance matters; and tax, trade and other regulatory matters. we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 . management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our net sales, profit results and cash flows are sensitive to, and may be affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, spending patterns, weather or other market disruptions. our net sales, profit, cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers' ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. in addition, market disruptions due to natural disasters, health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels. purchases of women's intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the decision by the u.k. to leave the european union ( brexit ) has increased the uncertainty in the economic and political environment in europe. the u.k.'s withdrawal is currently scheduled to take place in the first half of 2019, unless a further extension is agreed to; however, ongoing uncertainty remains as to what kind of post-brexit agreement between the u.k. and the european union, if any, may be approved by the u.k. parliament. our business in the u.k. may be adversely impacted by this uncertainty, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws. extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located, particularly in markets where we have multiple stores, could adversely affect our business. for example, heavy snowfall, rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. our net sales, operating income, cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 7 table of contents seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space. most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those retail areas. our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including destination retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control, such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area, consumer trends away from brick-and-mortar retail toward online shopping, competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores, the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators or developers of the shopping areas in which our stores are located. part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. some of our store locations, such as our victoria's secret flagship stores, require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments. additionally, we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use. the leases that we enter into are generally noncancelable leases with initial terms of 10 years. if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation. we intend to further expand into international markets, including mainland china, through partner arrangements and/or company-owned stores. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. any of these difficulties may lead to disruption in the overall timing of our international expansion efforts or increased costs. further, entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, volatility in the geopolitical landscape, restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance. we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners. in addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law. we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets. further, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. see fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations below. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 8 table of contents our licensees, franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners. although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners, the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited, and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. for example, our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially, and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully. these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. risks include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels; domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control; our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs; the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure, websites and the related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted order-taking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results. the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise. if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities, or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire, natural disaster or work stoppage, we could face shortages of inventory; incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers; and cause customer dissatisfaction. any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity, including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs, websites and other forums, may affect our reputation and brand and, consequently, reduce demand for our merchandise, even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate. failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to maintain the security of customer, associate, third-party or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. if our marketing, advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected. customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising, marketing and promotional activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores. although we use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including social media, websites, mobile applications, email, print and television, some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. our ability to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. in particular, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the u.s. if any third-party copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a 9 table of contents material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results. the sale of women's intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and online channels. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available and trends across our product categories may favor our competitors. we rely to a greater degree than some of our competitors on physical locations in shopping malls and centers and so declines in traffic to such locations may affect us more significantly than our competitors. some of our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers. increased competition, combined with declines in mall traffic, could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of pricing power and market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to manage the life cycle of our brands and to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands. our success depends in part on management's ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brands and to anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, salable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source, distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis. we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market. we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores. many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis. for example: political instability, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters which could negatively affect international economies, financial markets and business activity; imposition of new or retaliatory trade duties, sanctions or taxes and other charges on imports or exports; evolving, new or complex legal and regulatory matters; volatility in currency exchange rates; local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts; disruption due to labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation or other factors. we also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution centers, to our stores and to our customers. our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in labor costs and fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and associate strikes and inclement weather, which may impact our transportation providers' ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. 10 table of contents our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we rely on a number of vendor and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity, making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions. to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty, personal care and home fragrance products, we rely heavily on vendor and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio. as a result of geographic concentration of the vendor and distribution facilities that we rely upon, our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as accidents, system failures, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes, and other unforeseen events and circumstances. any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. in addition, our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term negative impacts of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results. as a result, the fluctuation in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. in addition, the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors may, at its discretion, decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. on november 19, 2018, our board of directors announced that it planned to reduce our annual ordinary dividend to $1.20 per share from $2.40 per share, beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in march 2019. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and our stock price. our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense. the credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs. we may be impacted by our ability to service or refinance our debt. we currently have substantial indebtedness. some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements. our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of 11 table of contents funds for our debt service payments. if our cash flow from operations declines, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt. shareholder activism could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price. shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management's and our board's attention and resources from our business. additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with our associates, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. also, we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors. our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism. we may be impacted by our ability to recruit, train and retain key personnel. we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including leslie h. wexner, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. we may be impacted by our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified associates and manage labor-related costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates, including store personnel and talented merchants. the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in labor-related costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our vendors' ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner, meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations. we purchase products from third-party vendors. factors outside our control, such as production or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. in addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image. our business could also suffer if our third-party vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates visit and monitor the operations of our third-party vendors, we do not control these vendors or their practices. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by third-party vendors used by us, or the divergence of a third-party vendor's or partner's labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs. product input costs, including freight, labor and raw materials, fluctuate. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs. we may not be able to, or may elect not to, pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 12 table of contents our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft. our assets are subject to loss, including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates, customers, vendors or unaffiliated third parties. we have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past, and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses. higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs. energy costs have fluctuated in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers. a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we self-insure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience. we are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers' compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. retained or contingent liabilities from businesses that we divest could adversely affect our financial results. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of la senza to an affiliate of regent lp, a global private equity firm. as a result of this divestiture, we may incur unexpected contingent liabilities, including with respect to leases assumed by the buyer. our divestiture activities may also present financial and operational risks. those risks may include difficulties separating personnel, financial and other systems, and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyer of la senza. any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our information technology systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. the increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores, impact our consumers' ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information, merchandise, financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, from time to time, we make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. 13 table of contents our ability to maintain the security of customer, associate, third-party or company information could have an impact on our reputation and our results. information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation with our customers, associates, investors and other third parties; cause the disclosure of confidential customer, associate, third-party or company information; cause our customers to stop shopping with us; and result in significant legal, regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues. while we train our associates and have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. in addition to our own networks and databases, we use third-party service providers to store, process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems. we have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks. despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or similar events. the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training associates and engaging consultants. additionally, we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cybersecurity breach. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements. we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations, including those required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, the sec and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ), among others. although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our associates, subcontractors, vendors, licensees, franchisees and other third parties could take actions that violate these laws and regulations. any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations. also, changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. for example, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. it may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business, and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations. we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters. we, along with third parties we do business with, are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims, whether by settlement or adverse court decision, may harm our business. further, potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us. we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits, but if the outcome were negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, the market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by changes in taxation, trade and other regulatory requirements. we are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. in addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. we regularly 14 table of contents assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. fluctuations in tax rates and duties, changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. there is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the u.s. and other countries. major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. we may use derivative financial instruments like foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign exchange rate risk we have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. our canadian dollar, british pound, chinese yuan, hong kong dollar and euro denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all our merchandise sold in canada, the u.k., ireland and greater china is sourced 49 table of contents through u.s. dollar transactions. although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates. further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in u.s. dollars, the royalties we receive in u.s. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency. as a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. interest rate risk our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. typically, our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of u.s. government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. excluding our foreign facilities, all of our long-term debt as of february 2, 2019 has fixed interest rates. we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. fair value of financial instruments the following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of outstanding publicly traded debt as of february 2, 2019 and february 3, 2018 : february 2, 2019 february 3, 2018 (in millions) long-term debt: principal value $ 5,722 $ 5,750 fair value, estimated (a) 5,340 5,943 foreign currency cash flow hedges (b) (2 ) 9 ________________ (a) the estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices. the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange.

typically our most profitable quarter. accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as our inventories build in advance of the holiday season. working capital we fund our business

outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in wuhan, china and has since spread globally. the coronavirus has been declared by the world health organization to be a pandemic, has spread to many countries, including the u.s., and is impacting worldwide economic activity. a public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. related industries in the u.s. and across the world may be adversely affected, including manufacturing and textile production. the situation and preventative or protective actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of stores where our products are sold, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and consumer spending, labor shortages and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials in the u.s., china and other countries. to the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time, and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacted. further, if the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, consumer behavior may be altered for an extended period of time which would impact our cash and liquidity and financial condition. the coronavirus and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and may adversely impact our stock price and ability to access cash. any one adverse effect of the coronavirus, or a combination of adverse effects, could materially impact our results and financial condition. subsequent to february 1, 2020 , we announced actions in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus. 5 table of contents on march 16, 2020, in an abundance of caution and as a proactive measure, we elected to borrow $950 million from our secured revolving credit facility ("secured revolving facility"), leaving our availability under the secured revolving facility at $22 million . on march 17, 2020, we announced the temporary closure of all bath &amp; body works, victoria's secret and pink stores in the united states and canada through march 29, 2020. associates will continue to receive pay and benefits through april 4, 2020, which is one week longer than originally announced. based on the continued spread of the coronavirus and stay-at-home orders by government officials across the country, we are extending the closure of our stores beyond the initial march 29th date. as the situation continues to evolve rapidly, we are not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings. however, we are monitoring the situation closely and will provide updates as appropriate. we continue to serve customers through our direct channels. in an effort to further strengthen our financial flexibility and efficiently manage through the pandemic, we are proactively taking the following additional actions: suspending our quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. we remain committed to paying dividends over the long-term and will re-evaluate when appropriate. executing a substantial reduction in expenses and capital expenditures. this includes an ongoing reduction in forward inventory receipts. temporarily reducing base compensation by 20% for senior vice presidents and above. the cash compensation of chairman and ceo leslie h. wexner and other members of the board of directors has been suspended. additionally, we are deferring annual merit increases. furloughing most store associates and those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home, effective april 5, 2020 until further notice. all furloughed associates will continue to receive existing healthcare benefits. as circumstances change, we will make every effort to bring these associates back to work as soon as possible. furloughed associates will also be able to apply for unemployment benefits, if eligible. as of march 27, 2020, we currently have more than $2 billion in cash, which includes the $950 million borrowed under the secured revolving facility on march 16, 2020. our secured revolving facility has certain financial covenants, including a debt to consolidated ebitda covenant, which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending may 2, 2020. if we were to violate a covenant, our lenders would have the right to accelerate our secured revolving facility indebtedness, demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder. while we believe that we would be able to obtain temporary waivers for any such breach of a covenant to prevent an acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness or obtain a replacement credit facility, we cannot conclude with certainty that we would have the ability to obtain necessary waivers or negotiate less restrictive debt covenants with our lenders. we are in active conversations with the lenders under our credit facility to obtain a replacement credit facility that does not contain a debt to consolidated ebitda financial covenant or a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant in our existing secured revolving facility. we believe that our current cash balance, along with the actions taken as outlined above, provides us with sufficient current liquidity. these recent developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additional information on this risk and other uncertainties and factors, is set forth in item 1a. risk factors. available information we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and its rules and regulations. the exchange act requires us to file reports,

in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 . management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our net sales, profit results and cash flows are sensitive to, and may be affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, spending patterns, weather, significant health hazards or pandemics or other market disruptions. our net sales, profit, cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers' ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. in addition, market disruptions due to natural disasters, significant health hazards or pandemics, or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels. extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located, particularly in markets where we have multiple stores, could adversely affect our business. purchases of women's intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in wuhan, china and has since spread globally. the coronavirus has been declared by the world health organization to be a pandemic, has spread to many countries, including the u.s., and is impacting worldwide economic activity. a public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk that the we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. related industries in the u.s. and across the world may be adversely effected, including manufacturing and textile production. the situation and preventative or protective actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of stores where our products are sold, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and 8 table of contents consumer spending, labor shortages or the extended furlough of our employees and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials in the u.s., china and other countries. to the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time, and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacted. further, if the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, consumer behavior may be altered for an extended period of time which would impact our cash and liquidity and financial condition. the coronavirus and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and may adversely impact our stock price and ability to access cash. any one adverse effect of the coronavirus, or a combination of adverse effects, could materially impact our results and financial condition. our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to this risk, and other uncertainties and factors. recently, the decision by the u.k. to leave the european union (commonly referred to as brexit ) has increased the uncertainty in the economic and political environment in europe. ongoing uncertainty remains as to what kind of post-brexit agreement between the u.k. and the european union, if any, may be approved by the u.k. parliament. our business in the u.k. may be adversely impacted by this uncertainty, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws. our net sales, operating income, cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we have entered into an agreement pursuant to which we will transfer certain assets and liabilities relating to our business conducted under the victoria's secret and pink brands (the victoria's secret business ) to a newly formed subsidiary ( victoria's secret holdco ) and sell 55% of the equity interests of victoria's secret holdco to an affiliate of sycamore partners management, l.p. ( sycamore ). the proposed vs transaction involves risks, including risks that the proposed transaction may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits. the vs transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, including; (1) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart-scott rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, (2) the receipt of approval under the competition act of canada, (3) the absence of any applicable law, injunction or other judgment that prohibits the closing, and (iv) the completion of certain restructuring transactions. in addition, each of our and sycamore's obligation to complete the vs transaction is subject to, among other things, the accuracy of the other party's representations and warranties in the transaction agreement (subject in most cases to material and material adverse effect qualifications), and the other party's compliance with its covenants and agreements in the transaction agreement in all material respects. the transaction agreement provides that we or sycamore may choose not to proceed with the vs transaction if the vs transaction has not been completed by august 20, 2020, which date may be extended by either party to november 20, 2020 under certain circumstances where the restructuring transactions have not been completed pending governmental approvals. the satisfaction of the required conditions could delay the consummation of the proposed transaction with sycamore or prevent it from occurring. further, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the proposed transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the proposed transaction will be consummated. with respect to regulatory approvals, there can be no assurance that the required regulatory approvals will be received in a timely manner or at all, or that such approvals will not contain adverse conditions. failure to consummate the proposed transaction in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, as well as our future business and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. assuming the vs transaction is completed, there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the anticipated value and benefits therefrom, and the vs transaction may adversely affect our business. the proposed transaction will result in a smaller, less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the vs transaction, which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions. additionally, a potential loss of synergies from separating the businesses could negatively impact our balance sheet, profit margins or earnings, and the price of our common stock may not be equal to or 9 table of contents greater than the value of our common stock had the vs transaction not occurred. if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the vs transaction, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the vs transaction is pending. uncertainty about the effect of the vs transaction on employees, commercial partners and vendors may have an adverse effect on us. these uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause commercial partners, vendors and others that deal with us to defer or decline entering into contracts with us or seek to change existing business relationships with us. certain of our contracts contain restrictions that may give rise to a right of termination or cancellation in connection with the vs transaction. in addition, if key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of the vs transaction, our business could be harmed. furthermore, the transaction agreement contains restrictions on our ability take certain actions relating to the victoria's secret business outside the ordinary course of business prior to the closing, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking certain actions or business opportunities that may arise prior to the closing. turnover in company leadership or other key positions may have an adverse impact on company performance. upon the consummation of the vs transaction, our current chief executive officer ("ceo") will step down and a new ceo will be appointed. leslie h. wexner will step down from his position as our ceo and chairman of the board after leading the company for more than five decades. mr. wexner will remain a member of the board as chairman emeritus. andrew meslow, the current chief executive officer of bath &amp; body works, will become our new ceo and will be appointed as a member of the board. sarah e. nash, a member of the board, will be appointed as the chair of the board, effective upon closing. additionally, current lead independent director allan tessler, as well as directors gordon gee and raymond zimmerman, will retire as of the date of the annual meeting, and upon mr. tessler's retirement, ms. nash will serve as lead independent director. such leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and an inadequate transition of our ceo may cause disruption to our business, including to our relationships with vendors and employees. we may well experience further changes in key leadership or key positions in the future. the departure of key leadership personnel, especially a long-serving ceo, can take from the company significant knowledge and experience. this loss of knowledge and experience can be mitigated through successful hiring and transition, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts. attracting and retaining qualified senior leadership may be more challenging under adverse business conditions. failure to attract and retain the right talent, or to smoothly manage the transition of responsibilities resulting from such turnover, would affect our ability to meet our challenges and may cause us to miss performance objectives or financial targets or disrupt our relationships with our customers. we may be impacted by our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified associates and manage labor-related costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates, including store personnel and talented merchants. the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in labor-related costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. retained or contingent liabilities from businesses that we divest could adversely affect our financial results. our continued involvement with victoria's secret holdco is also subject to various arrangements, and conditions outside of our control could affect our future results. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of la senza to an affiliate of regent lp, a global private equity firm, and in the first quarter of 2020, we signed a transaction agreement with sycamore to effect the vs transaction. as a result of the la senza divestiture and upon the consummation of the vs transaction, we may incur unexpected contingent liabilities, including with respect to leases assumed by the buyer. our divestiture activities may also present financial and operational risks. those risks may include difficulties separating personnel, financial and other systems, and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyer of la senza and/or victoria's secret holdco. any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we will continue to have financial involvement with victoria's secret holdco after the closing, including through our 45% interest in victoria's secret holdco, transition services agreements and guarantees. 10 table of contents under these arrangements, performance by victoria's secret holdco or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future results. our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space. most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those retail areas. our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including destination retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control, such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area, consumer trends away from brick-and-mortar retail toward online shopping, competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores, significant health hazards or pandemics, the closing of other stores or the decline in popularity or safety in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators or developers of the shopping areas in which our stores are located. part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. some of our store locations require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments. additionally, we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use. the leases that we enter into are generally noncancelable leases with initial terms of 10 years. if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation. we intend to further expand into international markets, including mainland china, through partner arrangements and/or company-owned stores. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. any of these difficulties may lead to disruption in the overall timing of our international expansion efforts or increased costs. further, entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, volatility in the geopolitical landscape, restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally, disruptions or delays in shipments, occurrence of significant health hazards or pandemics, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. for example, in december 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan, china, resulting in temporary store closures and a decrease in consumer traffic in china. to date, this virus has begun to spread globally. we expect the coronavirus to negatively impact our results of operations, particularly in the greater china business, and our plans for expansion in china, though the extent and duration of this impact remain uncertain. to the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacts. such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance. we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners. in addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law. we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets. 11 table of contents further, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. see fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations below. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our licensees, franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners. although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners, the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited, and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. for example, our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially, and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully. these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. risks include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels; domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control; our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs; the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure, websites and the related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted order-taking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results. the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise. if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities, or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire, natural disaster or work stoppage, we could face shortages of inventory; incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers; and cause customer dissatisfaction. any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity, including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs, websites and other forums, may affect our reputation and brand and, consequently, reduce demand for our merchandise, even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate. failure to comply with or the perception that the company has failed to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to maintain the security of customer, associate, third-party or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. if our marketing, advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected. customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising, marketing and promotional activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores. although we use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including social media, websites, mobile applications, email, print and television, some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. 12 table of contents our ability to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. in particular, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the u.s. if any third-party copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results. the sale of women's intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and online channels. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available and trends across our product categories may favor our competitors. we rely to a greater degree than some of our competitors on physical locations in shopping malls and centers and so declines in traffic to such locations may affect us more significantly than our competitors. some of our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers. increased competition, combined with declines in mall traffic, could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of pricing power and market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to manage the life cycle of our brands and to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands. our success depends in part on management's ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brands and to anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, salable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source, distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis. we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market. we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores. many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis. for example: political instability, environmental hazards or natural disasters which could negatively affect international economies, financial markets and business activity; significant health hazards or pandemics, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas; imposition of new or retaliatory trade duties, sanctions or taxes and other charges on imports or exports; evolving, new or complex legal and regulatory matters; volatility in currency exchange rates; 13 table of contents local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts; disruption due to labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation or other factors. we also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution centers, to our stores and to our customers. our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in labor costs and fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and associate strikes and inclement weather, which may impact our transportation providers' ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. for example, the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan, china has led to work and travel restrictions within, to, and out of mainland china, which in turn has led to delays in textile mill and factory openings, and delays in workers returning, following the chinese new year holiday. to date, this virus has begun to spread globally, and various governments have either enforced further restrictions or have begun pondering taking action soon. these restrictions and delays, which may further expand depending on the progression of the illness, may make it difficult for our suppliers to source raw materials in china, manufacture finished goods in china and export our products from china. additionally, our suppliers throughout asia source a significant amount of fabric from china. if the severity and reach of the coronavirus outbreak increases, there may be significant and material disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and delays in the manufacture and shipment of our products, which may then have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above, which are beyond our control, and the occurrence or deepening impact of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we rely on a number of vendor and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity, making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions. to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty, personal care and home fragrance products, we rely heavily on vendor and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio. as a result of geographic concentration of the vendor and distribution facilities that we rely upon, our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as accidents, system failures, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes, and other unforeseen events and circumstances. any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. in addition, our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term negative impacts of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results. as a result, the fluctuation in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. in addition, the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. 14 table of contents on march 27, 2020, our board of directors announced that it planned to suspend our annual ordinary dividend, beginning with the quarterly dividend to be paid in our second fiscal quarter in 2020. there can be no assurance if, when and at what level our board of directors may resume making dividend payments. on march 27, 2020, our board of directors announced that it planned to suspend our annual ordinary dividend, beginning with the quarterly dividend to be paid in our second fiscal quarter in 2020. while we remain committed to paying dividends over the long-term and will re-evaluate when appropriate, there can be no assurance if, when and at what level our board of directors may resume making dividend payments. our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability is subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our failure to pay dividends may negatively impact our stock price. our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense. the credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs. if we breach covenants in our secured revolving facility, our ability to service or refinance our debt as well as our financial stability may be impacted. we currently have substantial indebtedness. our secured revolving facility contains covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in the agreement. our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments. if our cash flow from operations declines, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt, or make certain restricted payments as defined in our secured revolving facility. if we fail to comply with any covenant, including our financial maintenance covenants, it could result in an event of default and our lenders could terminate the commitments under our secured revolving facility as well as certain foreign borrowing facilities and make the entire debt incurred thereunder immediately due and payable or we may be forced to sell assets, restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital, which would dilute our stockholders' interests. in particular, as of march 27, 2020, we currently have more than $2 billion in cash, which includes the $950 million borrowed under the secured revolving facility on march 16, 2020. however, our secured revolving facility has certain financial covenants, including a debt to consolidated ebitda covenant, which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending may 2, 2020. we are in active conversations with our lenders regarding a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant or the possibility of entering into a replacement credit facility without a similar covenant. if we are unable to obtain a temporary waiver for that anticipated covenant breach or to obtain a replacement credit facility without a similar covenant, our lenders would have the right to accelerate our secured revolving facility indebtedness, demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder. if this occurs, we might not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. even if new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. shareholder activism could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price. shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management's and our board's attention and resources from our business. additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with our associates, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. also, we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors. our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism. we may be impacted by our vendors' ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner, meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations. we purchase products from third-party vendors. factors outside our control, such as production or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. 15 table of contents in addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image. our business could also suffer if our third-party vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates visit and monitor the operations of our third-party vendors, we do not control these vendors or their practices. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by third-party vendors used by us, or the divergence of a third-party vendor's or partner's labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs. product input costs, including freight, labor and raw materials, fluctuate. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs. we may not be able to, or may elect not to, pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft. our assets are subject to loss, including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates, customers, vendors or unaffiliated third parties. we have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past, and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses. higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs. energy costs have fluctuated in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers. a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we self-insure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience. we are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers' compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our information technology systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite maintaining comprehensive measures, some of our systems, e-commerce environments, servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer, merchandise, financial, employee or other important information (including personal information) which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. the increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. 16 table of contents sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores, impact our customers' ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information, merchandise, financial or other important information (including personal information) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, from time to time, we make hardware, software and code modifications and upgrades to our information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. modifications involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. any significant compromise or breach of our data security, including the security of customer, associate, third-party or company information, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in the operation of our business, we collect, use, transmit and otherwise process a large volume of personal and other confidential, proprietary and sensitive information. information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. any significant compromise or breach of our data security, media reports about such an incident, whether accurate or not, or our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event, whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols, could significantly damage our reputation with our customers, associates, investors and other third parties, cause the disclosure of personal, confidential, proprietary or sensitive customer, associate, third-party or company information, cause interruptions to our operations and distraction to our management, cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal, regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues. while we train our associates and have implemented systems, processes and confidential security measures to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems against unauthorized access and prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or similar events. our systems and facilities are also subject to compromise from internal threats, such as theft, misuse, unauthorized access or other improper actions by employees, third-party service providers and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems, website or facilities. furthermore, because the methods of cyber-attack and deception change frequently, are increasingly complex and sophisticated, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including nation-state actors, despite our reasonable efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and website, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect, appropriately react and respond to, or implement effective preventative measures against, all cybersecurity incidents. in addition to our own systems, networks and databases, we use third-party service providers to store, transmit and otherwise process certain of this information on our behalf. due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for any cybersecurity incident attributed to our service providers as they relate to the information we share with them or to which they are granted access. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems. we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against, respond to, and recover from any potential, attempted, or existing cybersecurity incidents. as cybersecurity incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. in addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. the inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. moreover, there could be public announcements regarding any cybersecurity incidents and any steps we take to respond to or remediate such incidents, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these announcements to be negative, it could, among other things, have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. while we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to breaches, failures or other data security-related incidents, and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance 17 table of contents coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. changes in laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations, or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we are, and may increasingly become, subject to various laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we operate. the regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in the u.s., various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the consumer financial protection bureau and the federal trade commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. for example, the california consumer privacy act ( ccpa ), which increases privacy rights for california residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, went into effect on january 1, 2020. among other things, the ccpa requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. this private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. in addition, laws in all 50 u.s. states require businesses to provide notice to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. state laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in congress of a new comprehensive federal data privacy law to which we would become subject if it is enacted. we are subject to international laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, which apply broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information. for example, the e.u. general data protection regulation ( gdpr ), which became effective in may 2018, greatly increased the european commission's jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data. eu member states are tasked under the gdpr to enact, and have enacted, certain implementing legislation that adds to and/or further interprets the gdpr requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations. the gdpr, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the eu member states and the united kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, use, retain, protect, disclose, transfer and otherwise process personal data. in particular, the gdpr includes obligations and restrictions concerning the consent and rights of individuals to whom the personal data relates, the transfer of personal data out of the european economic area or the united kingdom, security breach notifications and the security and confidentiality of personal data. the gdpr authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or 20 million, whichever is greater. all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training associates and engaging consultants, which are likely to increase over time. in addition, such requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or customers, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, penalties or judgments, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements. we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations, including those required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, the sec and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ), among others. although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our 18 table of contents associates, subcontractors, vendors, licensees, franchisees and other third parties could take actions that violate these laws and regulations. any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations. also, changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. for example, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. it may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business, and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations. we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters. we, along with third parties we do business with, are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims, whether by settlement or adverse court decision, may harm our business. further, potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us. we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits, but if the outcome were negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, the market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may be impacted by changes in taxation, trade and other regulatory requirements. we are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. in addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. fluctuations in tax rates and duties, changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. there is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the u.s. and other countries. major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 58 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. we may use derivative financial instruments like foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 58 table of contents foreign exchange rate risk we have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. our canadian dollar, british pound, chinese yuan, hong kong dollar and euro denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all our merchandise sold in canada, the u.k., ireland and greater china is sourced through u.s. dollar transactions. although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with our operations in canada and the u.k., these measures may not succeed in offsetting all the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates. further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in u.s. dollars, the royalties we receive in u.s. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency. as a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. interest rate risk our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. typically, our investment portfolio is comprised of u.s. government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. excluding our foreign facilities, all of our long-term debt as of february 1, 2020 has fixed interest rates. we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. fair value of financial instruments as of february 1, 2020 , we believe that the carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximate fair value because of their short maturity. the following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of outstanding publicly traded debt and other financial instruments as of february 1, 2020 and february 2, 2019 : february 1, 2020 february 2, 2019 (in millions) long-term debt: principal value $ 5,458 $ 5,722 fair value, estimated (a) 5,555 5,340 foreign currency cash flow hedges (b) (2 ) ________________ (a) the estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices. the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. (b) hedge arrangements are in a net asset position. concentration of credit risk we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. typically, our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of u.s. government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. 59 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is set forth on pages 10 and 15 of the 2000 annual report and is incorporated herein by reference.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is set forth on pages 35 and 42 of the 2001 annual report and is incorporated herein by reference.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is set forth on pages 30 and 41 of the 2002 annual report and is incorporated herein by reference.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is set forth on pages 54 and 78 of the 2003 annual report and is incorporated herein by reference.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is set forth on pages 46 and 66 of the 2004 annual report and is incorporated herein by reference.risk factors 4 general. limited brands, inc. (the company ) operates in the highly competitive specialty retail business in the united states. the company sells women intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products and women and men apparel. the company sells merchandise at its retail stores (primarily mall-based) and through direct response channels (catalogue and e-commerce). description of operations. general. as of january 28, 2006, the company conducted its business in three primary segments: victoria secret, bath &amp; body works and apparel. the victoria secret segment derives its revenues from sales of women intimate and other apparel, beauty products and accessories marketed primarily under the victoria secret brand name. victoria secret merchandise is sold through retail stores and direct channels (catalogue and e-commerce). the bath &amp; body works segment derives its revenues from the sale of personal care, beauty and home fragrance products marketed under the bath &amp; body works, c.o. bigelow and white barn candle company brand names, as well as from sales of products under third-party brand names. bath &amp; body works merchandise is sold at retail stores and on-line. the apparel segment derives its revenues from sales of women and men apparel through express and limited stores. 1 table of contents the following chart reflects the retail businesses and the number of stores in operation for each business at january 28, 2006 and january 29, 2005. number of stores january 28, 2006 january 29, 2005 victoria secret 998 1,001 bath &amp; body works 1,555 1,569 apparel businesses express women 327 468 express men 113 223 express dual gender 303 193 total express 743 884 limited stores 292 323 total apparel businesses 1,035 1,207 henri bendel 2 2 total 3,590 3,779 the following table shows the changes in the number of retail stores operated by the company for the past five fiscal years: fiscal year beginning of year opened closed disposed businesses end of year 2001 5,129 275 (137 ) (653 )(a) 4,614 2002 4,614 108 (174 ) (512 )(b) 4,036 2003 4,036 24 (149 ) 3,911 2004 3,911 39 (171 ) 3,779 2005 3,779 50 (239 ) 3,590 (a) represents lane bryant stores at august 16, 2001, the date of sale to a third-party.

( mast ), an apparel importer which is a significant supplier of merchandise for victoria secret, express and limited stores. mast also has $564 million of external sales to third-parties in 2005 and its operating results are included in the other segment. for additional information, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. during fiscal year 2005, the company purchased merchandise from over 1,000 suppliers located throughout the world. in addition to purchases through mast, the company purchases merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market. excluding mast, no supplier provided 10% or more of the company merchandise purchases. most of the merchandise and related materials for the company stores are shipped to the company distribution centers in the columbus, ohio area. in connection with the distribution of merchandise, the company uses a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title to the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination. the company policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory on hand in its retail stores and distribution centers so that it can offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. the company emphasizes rapid turnover and takes markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current with fashion trends. 2 table of contents the company operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: spring (the first and second quarters) and fall (the third and fourth quarters). the fourth quarter, including the holiday season, accounted for approximately one-third of net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003. accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as the company inventory builds in advance of the holiday season. the company and its products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities. the company is subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements. the company trademarks and patents, which constitute its primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the united states patent and trademark office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. the company believes that its products and services are identified by its intellectual property and, thus, its intellectual property is of significant value. accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement. the following is a brief description of each of the company brand businesses: victoria secret victoria secret is a leading specialty retailer of women intimate and other apparel and beauty products. victoria secret had net sales of $4.448 billion in 2005 and

selling square footage, is set forth under item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. for the financial results of the company reportable operating segments, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. competition. the sale of intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, and women and men apparel through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain fashion 3 table of contents specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. brand image, marketing, fashion design, price, service, fashion assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. the company direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional catalogue and e-commerce merchandisers. image presentation, fulfillment and the factors affecting retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in catalogue and e-commerce sales. the company is unable to estimate the number of competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of companies selling intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, and women and men apparel through retail stores, catalogues and e-commerce. associate relations. on january 28, 2006, the company employed approximately 110,000 associates, 92,000 of whom were part-time. in addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season. available information. the company annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, amendments to those reports and code of conduct are available, free of charge, on the company website, www.limitedbrands.com. these reports are available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission. item 1a. risk factors. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as discussed in item 1. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of the company business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md&amp;a ), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect the company business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not the only risks facing the company. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect the business, financial condition and/or operating results of the company in a material way. the company revenue and profit results are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns. the company growth, sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. purchases of women and men apparel, women intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, the company may increase the number of promotional sales, which would further adversely affect its profitability. the company net sales, operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. the company experiences major seasonal fluctuations in its net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of its operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on the company financial condition and results of operations. 4 table of contents seasonal fluctuations also affect the company inventory levels, since it usually orders merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. the company must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if the company is not successful in selling inventory during the holiday period, it may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or it may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which in each case may further adversely affect profitability. the company may be unable to compete favorably in its highly competitive segment of the retail industry. the sale of intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. the company competes for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, the company also competes with direct marketers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through catalogues and e-commerce. direct marketers also include traditional store-based retailers like the company who are competing in the catalogue and e-commerce distribution channels. the company direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional catalogue and e-commerce merchandisers. brand image, marketing, fashion design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in catalogue and e-commerce sales. some of the company competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available to them. in many cases, the company primary competitors sell their products in department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as the company stores. in addition to competing for sales, the company competes for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls. increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations. the company may not be able to keep up with fashion trends and may not be able to launch new product lines successfully. the company success depends in part on management ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer tastes and fashion trends change rapidly. if the company is unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends and misjudges the market for its products or any new product lines, the company sales will be lower and it may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, the company may be forced to increase its marketing promotions or price markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. the company brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate that the company is no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions. the company may lose key personnel. the company believes that it has benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of its senior executives, including leslie h. wexner (its chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer). the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the business and prospects of the company. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and the company future success will also depend on its ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified personnel. the company manufacturers may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner or meet quality standards. the company purchases apparel through its wholly-owned subsidiary, mast, an apparel importer, through other contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. personal care, fragrance and 5 table of contents beauty products are also purchased through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. similar to most other specialty retailers, the company has narrow sales window periods for much of its inventory. factors outside the company control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations. the company relies significantly on foreign sources of production. the company purchases apparel merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market, some of which is manufactured overseas. the company does not have any material long-term merchandise supply contracts and many of its imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas. the company competes with other companies for production facilities and import quota capacity. the company also faces a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as: political instability; imposition of new legislation or rules relating to imports that may limit the quantity of goods which may be imported into the united states from countries in a particular region; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; currency and exchange risks; local business practice and political issues, including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and related pricing impacts; and disruption of imports by labor disputes. new initiatives may be proposed that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries. in addition, significant health hazards or environmental or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity. in particular, the outbreak of avian influenza and concerns over its spread throughout asia and elsewhere could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity in asia and elsewhere. the company purchases of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk. the future performance of the company will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond its control. these factors may have a material adverse effect on the business of the company. the company depends on a high volume of mall traffic and the availability of suitable lease space. many of the company stores are located in shopping malls. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the high volume of traffic in those malls. the company stores benefit from the ability of the mall anchor tenants, generally large department stores, and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of its stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations. sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from non-mall retailers and other malls where the company does not have stores and the closing of anchor department stores. in addition, a decline 6 table of contents in the desirability of the shopping environment in a particular mall, or a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among the company target consumers, would adversely affect its business. part of the company future growth is significantly dependent on its ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs that allow the company to earn a reasonable return. the company cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing may affect the company business. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of the company order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. the company relies on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact the company earnings if it was unable to pass such increases directly onto its customers or by implementing more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. the company stock price may be volatile. the company stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the company or other companies in the retail industry or markets served by the company. in addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. the company may be unable to service its debt. the company may be unable to service the debt drawn under its credit facilities and/or any other debt it incurs. additionally, the agreements related to such debt require the company to maintain certain financial ratios which limit the total amount the company may borrow, and also prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets. the company is implementing certain changes to its it systems that may disrupt operations. the company is currently implementing modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for merchandise, distribution and support systems, including finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. the company is aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. the launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach over an approximate three year period that began in 2005. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on the company operations. the company results can be adversely affected by market disruptions. market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, health hazards, terrorist activities or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect the company results or prospects in affected markets. the receipt of proceeds under any insurance the company maintains for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset its losses. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 32 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk management believes the company exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and market risk associated with financial instruments (such as investments and borrowings) is not material. fair value of financial instruments the carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value because of their short maturity. the fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. the estimated fair value of the company long-term debt at january 28, 2006 and january 29, 2005 was $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion compared to the carrying value of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. concentration of credit risk the company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions, as well as corporate commercial paper. the company monitors the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. the company also monitors the creditworthiness of the entities to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. 32 table of contents safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995

business practices and political issues and risks related to currency and exchange rates; risks associated with the possible lack of availability of suitable store locations on appropriate terms; risks associated with increases in the costs of mailing, paper and printing; risks associated with our ability to service any debt we incur from time to time, as well as the requirements the agreements related to such debt impose upon us; and risks associated with the company reliance on information technology, including risks related to the implementation of new information technology

other in our segment reporting. for additional information, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. during fiscal year 2006, the company purchased merchandise from over 1,000 suppliers located throughout the world. in addition to purchases through mast and beauty avenues, the company purchases merchandise directly in foreign and domestic markets. excluding mast and beauty avenues, no supplier provided 10% or more of the company merchandise purchases. most of the merchandise and related materials for the company stores are shipped to the company distribution centers in the columbus, ohio area. in connection with the distribution of merchandise, the company uses a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title to the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination. the company policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory on hand in its retail stores and distribution centers so that it can offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. the company emphasizes rapid turnover and takes markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current with fashion trends. the company operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: spring (the first and second quarters) and fall (the third and fourth quarters). the fourth quarter, including the holiday season, accounted for approximately one-third of net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004. accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as the company inventory builds in advance of the holiday season. the company and its products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities. the company is subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements. the company trademarks and patents, which constitute its primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the united states patent and trademark office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. the company believes that its 3 table of contents products and services are identified by its intellectual property and, thus, its intellectual property is of significant value. accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement. competition. the sale of intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, women and men apparel and accessories through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. brand image, marketing, fashion design, price, service, fashion assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. the company direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional e-commerce and catalogue merchandisers. image presentation, fulfillment and the factors affecting retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in e-commerce and catalogue sales. the company is unable to estimate the number of competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of companies selling intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, women and men apparel and accessories through retail stores, catalogues and e-commerce. associate relations. on february 3, 2007, the company employed approximately 125,500 associates, 105,100 of whom were part-time. in addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season. available information. the company annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, amendments to those reports and code of conduct are available, free of charge, on the company website, www.limitedbrands.com. these reports are available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission. item 1a. risk factors. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as discussed in item 1. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of the company business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect the company business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not the only risks facing the company. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect the business, financial condition and/or operating results of the company in a material way. the company revenue and profit results are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns. the company growth, sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. purchases of women and men apparel, women intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, the company may increase the number of promotional sales, which would further adversely affect its profitability. 4 table of contents the company net sales, operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. the company experiences major seasonal fluctuations in its net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of its operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on the company financial condition and results of operations. seasonal fluctuations also affect the company inventory levels, since it usually orders merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. the company must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if the company is not successful in selling inventory, it may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or it may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which in each case may further adversely affect profitability. the company may be unable to compete favorably in its highly competitive segment of the retail industry. the sale of intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. the company competes for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, the company also competes with direct marketers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through e-commerce and catalogue. direct marketers also include traditional store-based retailers like the company who are competing in the e-commerce and catalogue distribution channels. the company direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional e-commerce and catalogue merchandisers. brand image, marketing, fashion design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and direct response channels. some of the company competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available to them. in many cases, the company competitors sell their products in department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as the company stores. in addition to competing for sales, the company competes for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls. increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations. the company may not be able to keep up with fashion trends and may not be able to launch new product lines successfully. the company success depends in part on management ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer tastes and fashion trends change rapidly. if the company is unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends and misjudges the market for its products or any new product lines, the company sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, the company may be forced to increase its marketing promotions or price markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. the company brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate that the company is no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions. the company may lose key personnel. the company believes that it has benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of its senior executives, including leslie h. wexner (its chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer). the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the business and prospects of the company. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and the company future success will also depend on its ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified personnel. 5 table of contents the company manufacturers may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner or meet quality standards. the company purchases products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. similar to most other specialty retailers, the company has narrow sales window periods for much of its inventory. factors outside the company control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations. the company relies significantly on foreign sources of production and maintains operations in foreign countries. the company purchases apparel merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market, some of which is manufactured overseas. the company does not have any material long-term merchandise supply contracts and many of its imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas. the company competes with other companies for production facilities and import quota capacity. the company also faces a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as: political instability; imposition of new legislation or rules relating to imports that may limit the quantity of goods which may be imported into the united states from countries in a particular region; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; currency and exchange risks; local business practice and political issues, including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and related pricing impacts; and disruption of imports by labor disputes. new initiatives may be proposed that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries. in addition, significant health hazards or environmental or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity. the company purchases of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk. the future performance of the company will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond its control. these factors may have a material adverse effect on the business of the company. the company depends on a high volume of mall traffic and the availability of suitable lease space. many of the company stores are located in shopping malls. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the high volume of traffic in those malls. the company stores benefit from the ability of the mall anchor tenants, generally large department stores, and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of its stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations. sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from non-mall retailers and other 6 table of contents malls where the company does not have stores and the closing of anchor department stores. in addition, a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment in a particular mall, or a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among the company target consumers, would adversely affect its business. part of the company future growth is significantly dependent on its ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs that allow the company to earn a reasonable return. the company cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. the company may face labor shortages or increased labor costs which could adversely affect its growth and operating results. labor is a significant component in the cost of operating the company stores. if the company faces labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, increases in the federal minimum wage or increases in other employee benefits costs, its operating expenses could increase and its growth could be adversely affected. the company success depends in part upon its ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing may affect the company business. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of the company order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. the company relies on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact the company earnings if it was unable to pass such increases directly onto its customers or by implementing more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. the company stock price may be volatile. the company stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the company or other companies in the retail industry or markets served by the company. in addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. the company may be unable to service its debt. the company may be unable to service the debt drawn under its credit facilities and/or any other debt it incurs. additionally, the agreements related to such debt require the company to maintain certain financial ratios which limit the total amount the company may borrow, and also prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets. the company is implementing certain changes to its it systems that may disrupt operations. the company is currently implementing modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for merchandise, distribution, e-commerce and support systems, including finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. the company is aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. the launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach over an approximate five year period that began in 2005. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on the company operations. 7 table of contents the company relies significantly on its information technology systems. the company success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of its information technology systems. the company computer systems as well as those of its service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of the company servers and those of its service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. despite the precautions the company has taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in the company information technology systems. sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt the company ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company operations, controls and reporting. the company results can be adversely affected by market disruptions. market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards, terrorist activities or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect the company results or prospects in affected markets. the receipt of proceeds under any insurance the company maintains for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset its losses. the company results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in the company transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for its retail stores and costs to purchase product from its manufacturers. a continual rise in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for the company products and increase its operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations. the company licensees could take actions that could harm our business or brands. the company has global representation through independently owned la senza stores operating under license agreements. although we have criteria to evaluate and screen prospective licensees, we are limited in the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our licensees do not operate successfully. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 32 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in the company financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. the company foreign exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of the january 2007 acquisition of la senza corporation, whose operations are conducted primarily in canada. to mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate, the company entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. these cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate u.s. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and u.s. dollar principal payments upon maturity. the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans. the company uses derivative financial instruments like the cross-currency swaps to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates. the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. management believes the company exposure to interest rate risk associated with financial instruments (such as investments and borrowings) is not material. fair value of financial instruments the carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value because of their short maturity. the fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. the estimated fair value of the company long-term debt was $1.6 billion compared to the carrying value of $1.7 billion at both february 3, 2007 and january 28, 2006. the aggregate fair value of foreign currency swap arrangements was $3 million at february 3, 2007. concentration of credit risk the company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions, as well as corporate commercial paper. the company monitors the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. the company also monitors the creditworthiness of the entities to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

our trademarks and patents, which constitute our primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the united states patent and trademark office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. we believe our products and services are identified by our intellectual property and, thus, our intellectual property is of significant value. accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement. competition. the sale of intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. our direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional e-commerce and catalogue merchandisers. image presentation, fulfillment and the factors affecting retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in e-commerce and catalogue sales. associate relations. on february 2, 2008, we employed approximately 97,500 associates, 78,100 of whom were part-time. in addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season. executive officers of the registrant. set forth below is certain information regarding our executive officers. leslie h. wexner, 70, has been our chairman of the board of directors for more than thirty years and our chief executive officer since our founding in 1963. martyn r. redgrave, 55, has been our executive vice president and chief administrative officer since march 2005. in addition, mr. redgrave was our chief financial officer from september 2006 to april 2007. stuart b.

on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, amendments to those reports and code of conduct are available, free of charge, on our website, www.limitedbrands.com. these reports are available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission. item 1a. risk factors. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as discussed in item 1. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our revenue and profit results are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns. our growth, sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. purchases of women intimate apparel, apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which would further adversely affect our profitability. our net sales depend on a high volume of mall traffic and the availability of suitable lease space. many of our stores are located in shopping malls. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the high volume of traffic in those malls. our stores benefit from the ability of the mall anchor tenants, generally large department stores, and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations. sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from non-mall retailers and other malls where we do not have stores and the closing of anchor department stores. in addition, a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment in a particular mall, or a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among our target consumers, would adversely affect our business. part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. our net sales, operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 5 table of contents seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which in each case may further adversely affect profitability. our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel, particularly at the store management level, and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our growth. we intend to further expand into international markets. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. in addition, we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners for our international expansion. further, entry into this market may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. we cannot ensure the profitability of our expansion into international markets. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our licensees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned la senza stores operating under license agreements. although we have criteria to evaluate and screen prospective licensees, the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees is limited and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our licensees do not operate successfully. our direct channel business includes risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results from operations. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results. risks include, but are not limited to the (a) diversion of sales from our stores, which may impact comparable store sales figures, (b) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels, (c) domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and re-selling it overseas outside our control and (d) risks related to the failure of the systems that operate the web sites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. any of these events could adversely affect our business. in august 2007, we opened a new distribution center for our victoria secret direct business that includes new systems, material handling equipment and processes. the ramp-up of the new distribution center to full capacity has been very challenging and has resulted in significant delays in shipping and incurrence of additional costs. we expect to continue to incur additional costs into 2008 as a result of these operational challenges. 6 table of contents our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities or adverse publicity regarding our responses to these concerns could also jeopardize our reputation. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. our failure to adequately protect our trade names and trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names and trademarks are an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names and trademarks and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries in which our manufacturers are located. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. if any third party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, our brand images could be materially adversely affected. our results can be adversely affected by market disruptions. market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards, terrorist activities or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect our results or prospects in affected markets. the receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset our losses. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of our quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of other companies in the retail industry or the markets we serve. in addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital. the credit ratings agencies have periodically reviewed our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected. we may be unable to service our debt. we may be unable to service our outstanding debt or any other debt we incur. additionally, some of our debt related agreements require maintenance of certain financial ratios which limit the total amount we may borrow and also prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets. our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results. the sale of intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores 7 table of contents and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through e-commerce and catalogues. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and direct response channels. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. in many cases, our competitors sell their products in department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls. increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our ability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact our results. our success depends in part on management ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. our brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate we are no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions. we may be unable to retain key personnel. it is our belief we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including leslie h. wexner (chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer). the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. we may be unable to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store personnel. the turnover rate in the retail industry is high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries. we purchase intimate apparel merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market, some of which is manufactured overseas. we do not have any material long-term merchandise supply contracts. many of our imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. 8 table of contents we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as: political instability; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; legal and regulatory matters; currency and exchange risks; local business practice and political issues, including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and related pricing impacts; disruption of imports by labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation. new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries. in addition, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity. our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk. our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our business. our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards. we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. similar to most other specialty retailers, we have narrow sales window periods for much of our inventory. factors outside our control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase product from our manufacturers. a continual rise in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly onto our customers or by implementing more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. 9 table of contents we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our computer systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, controls and reporting. in addition, we are currently implementing modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for merchandise, sourcing, distribution, e-commerce and support systems, including finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. the launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach over an approximate five year period that began in 2005. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements. as a public company, we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ). failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 43 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. our foreign exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of the january 2007 acquisition of la senza corporation, whose operations are conducted primarily in canada. to mitigate the risk to our earnings and the fair value of our investment in la senza associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. these cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate u.s. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and u.s. dollar principal payments upon maturity. the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans. as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related cross-currency swaps, we do not believe there is any material risk associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate. we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to our investments and our debt. our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. the majority of our long-term debt as of february 2, 2008 has fixed interest rates. thus, our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. our $750 million term loan due august 2012 contains a variable interest rate that fluctuates based on changes in an underlying benchmark interest rate and changes in our credit rating. in january 2008, we executed a participating interest rate swap arrangement which limits our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rate while allowing us to partially participate in any decreases in the benchmark interest rate. prior to the execution of the participating interest rate swap, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in the average term loan interest rate would have resulted in $3 million of additional interest expense during 2007. we use derivative financial instruments like the cross-currency swaps and the participating interest rate swap arrangement to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. fair value of financial instruments as of february 2, 2008, management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. the estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $2.8 billion compared to the carrying value of $2.9 billion at february 2, 2008. the estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $1.6 billion compared to the carrying value of $1.7 billion at february 3, 2007. the aggregate fair value of our foreign currency swap arrangements was a liability of $54 million as of february 2, 2008 and a liability of $3 million as of february 3, 2007. the fair value of our participating interest rate swap arrangement was a liability of $13 million as of february 2, 2008. concentration of credit risk we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions, as well as corporate commercial paper. we monitor the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. we also monitor the creditworthiness of the entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. 43 table of contents safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we caution that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the

excluding mast and beauty avenues, no supplier provided 10% or more of our merchandise purchases. most of the merchandise and related materials for our stores are shipped to our distribution centers in the columbus, ohio area. we use a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title to the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination. our policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventories on hand in our retail stores and distribution centers to enable us to offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. we emphasize rapid turnover and take markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current. our operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: spring (the first and second quarters) and fall (the third and fourth quarters). the fourth quarter, including the holiday season, accounted for approximately one-third of our net sales for 2008, 2007 and 2006 and is typically our most profitable quarter. accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as our inventories build in advance of the holiday season. we and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities. we are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements. our trademarks and patents, which constitute our primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the united states patent and trademark office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. we believe our products and services are identified by our intellectual property and, thus, our intellectual property is of significant value. accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement. competition. the sale of women intimate and other apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. our direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional direct response merchandisers. image presentation, fulfillment and the factors affecting retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in direct response sales. 3 associate relations. on january 31, 2009, we employed approximately 90,900 associates, 72,100 of whom were part-time. in addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season. executive officers of the registrant. set forth below is certain information regarding our executive officers. leslie h. wexner, 71, has been our

practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission. item 1a. risk factors. the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements, as discussed in item 1. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our revenue, profit results and cash flow are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns. our growth, sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. 4 purchases of women intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which would further adversely affect our profitability and cash flow. the current economic crisis has reduced consumer demand, which has adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to do so. our financial performance in 2008 was significantly impacted by the global economic downturn and its effect on the retail environment. further deterioration in economic conditions, along with increasing unemployment levels, may continue to reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit customers use of credit, which may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits through reduced purchases of our products. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which would further adversely affect our profitability. the global economic crisis could also impair the solvency of our suppliers, customers and other counterparties. there could be a number of additional effects from the ongoing economic downturn. the inability of key suppliers to access liquidity, or the insolvency of key suppliers, could lead to delivery delays or failures. we provide merchandise sourcing services to other retailers and licensees and grant credit to these parties in the normal course of business which subjects us to potential credit risk. additionally, we have guaranteed the lease payments of certain of our former subsidiaries. financial difficulties of our customers or those former subsidiaries for whom we guarantee lease payments could adversely impact our results of operations. finally, other counterparty failures, including banks and counterparties to contractual arrangements, could negatively impact our business. the global economic crisis could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. recently, the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly. these conditions have adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital. although we believe that our capital structure and credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity through the credit crisis, there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by these changes in the financial markets or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. if these conditions continue or become worse, our future cost of debt and equity capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space. most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the high volume of traffic in those retail areas. our stores benefit from the ability of the retail and other attractions in an area including destination retail and other attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from other retail and non-retail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores. recently, sales volume and mall traffic has been adversely affected by the recessionary economic conditions. part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. our net sales, operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 5 seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which in each case may further adversely affect profitability. our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel, particularly at the store management level, and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. in addition, these goals may be adversely affected by the current recessionary conditions. our plans for international expansion include risks that could materially adversely impact our growth. we intend to further expand into international markets. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. in addition, we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners for our international expansion. further, entry into this market may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. we cannot ensure the profitability of our expansion into international markets. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our licensees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned la senza stores operated by licensees. although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective licensees, the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees is limited and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our licensees do not operate successfully. our direct channel business includes risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results from operations. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results. risks include, but are not limited to the (a) diversion of sales from our stores, which may impact comparable store sales figures, (b) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels, (c) domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and re-selling it overseas outside our control and (d) risks related to the failure of the systems that operate the web sites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. any of these events could adversely affect our business. our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental 6 standards for all of our operations and activities or adverse publicity regarding our responses to these concerns could also jeopardize our reputation. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. our failure to adequately protect our trade names and trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names and trademarks are an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names and trademarks and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. if any third-party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, our brand images could be materially adversely affected. our results can be adversely affected by market disruptions. market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards, terrorist activities or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect our results or prospects in affected markets. the receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset our losses. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. in addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and would increase our interest expense. the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected. additionally, our failure to maintain our credit rating would result in higher interest costs under our existing debt terms. we may be unable to service our debt. we may be unable to service our outstanding debt or any other debt we incur. additionally, some of our debt related agreements require maintenance of certain financial ratios which limit the total amount we may borrow and also prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets. if we violate the financial ratios associated with these debt agreements, we may be required to accelerate repayment of this debt. 7 our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results. the sale of intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through direct response channels. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and direct response channels. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. in many cases, our competitors sell their products in department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls. increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. the recent recessionary conditions have resulted in more significant competition and our competitors have lowered prices and engaged in more promotional activity. our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands. our success depends in part on management ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate we are no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions. we may be unable to retain key personnel. it is our belief we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including leslie h. wexner (chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer). the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. we may be unable to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store personnel and talented merchants. the turnover rate in the retail industry is high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 8 we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries. we purchase merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market. we do not have any material long-term merchandise supply contracts. many of our imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as: political instability; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; legal and regulatory matters; currency and exchange risks; local business practice and political issues, including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and related pricing impacts; disruption of imports by labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation. new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries. in addition, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity. our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk. our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our business. our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards. we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. similar to most other specialty retailers, we have narrow sales window periods for much of our inventory. factors outside our control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs. energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase product from our manufacturers. a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk 9 mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly onto our customers or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. we self-insure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience. we are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. any adverse claims experience could result in future costs significantly in excess of historical costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our computer systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, controls and reporting. in addition, we are currently implementing modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for merchandise, sourcing, distribution, e-commerce and support systems, including finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. the launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements. as a public company, we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ). failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock. we may be subject to certain legal matters. we are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. difficulty can exist in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations that affect how we operate. in addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 48 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. our foreign exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of the january 2007 acquisition of la senza corporation, whose operations are conducted primarily in canada. to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our investment in la senza associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. these cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate u.s. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and u.s. dollar principal payments upon maturity. the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same 48 time as the related loans. as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related cross-currency swaps, we do not believe there is any material translation risk associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate. in addition, la senza canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate risk as substantially all of la senza merchandise is sourced through u.s. dollar transactions. we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to our investments and our debt. our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. currently, our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of u.s. government-backed securities. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. all of our long-term debt as of january 31, 2009 has fixed interest rates with the exception of our $750 million term loan due august 2012. thus, our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. our $750 million term loan due august 2012 contains a variable interest rate that fluctuates based on changes in an underlying benchmark interest rate and changes in our credit rating. in january 2008, we executed a participating interest rate swap arrangement which limits our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rate while allowing us to partially participate in any decreases in the benchmark interest rate. we use derivative financial instruments like the cross-currency swaps and the participating interest rate swap arrangement to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. fair value of financial instruments as of january 31, 2009, management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. the following table provides a summary of the carrying value and fair value of long-term debt and swap arrangements as of january 31, 2009 and february 2, 2008: january 31, 2009 february 2, 2008 (in millions) long-term debt: carrying value $ 2,897 $ 2,912 (a) fair value, estimated (b) 2,113 2,789 aggregate fair value of cross-currency swap arrangements (c) (26 ) 54 fair value of participating interest rate swap arrangement (c) 30 13 (a) includes current portion of long-term debt of $7 million. (b) the estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt is based on quoted market prices. the estimated fair value of our $750 million term loan is equal to its carrying value. on february 19, 2009, the terms of the term loan were amended. the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. (c) swap arrangements are in an (asset) liability position. 49 the decrease in estimated fair value of our long-term debt from february 2, 2008 to january 31, 2009 reflects the substantial increase in volatility in the credit markets and the associated higher yields on our publicly traded debt. the change in fair value of the cross currency-swap arrangements from february 2, 2008 to january 31, 2009 is primarily due to the fluctuations in the u.s. dollar canadian dollar exchange rate. the change in fair value of the participating interest rate swap arrangement from february 2, 2008 to january 31, 2009 is primarily due to the decline in the underlying benchmark interest rate. concentration of credit risk we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions, as well as corporate commercial paper from time to time. currently, our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of u.s. government-backed securities. we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions and other entities with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. we also monitor the creditworthiness of entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and counterparties to derivative instruments. safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we caution that any

in item 1. these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10-k, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. in addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. the risks described below are not our only risks. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way. our revenue, profit results and cash flow are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns. our growth, sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. 5 table of contents in particular, our operating results are generally impacted by changes in the united states and canadian economies. negative economic conditions may impact the level of consumer spending and inhibit customers use of credit. purchases of women intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. in such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the global economic crisis could also impair the solvency of our suppliers, customers and other counterparties. there could be a number of additional effects from the ongoing economic downturn. the inability of key suppliers to access liquidity, or the insolvency of key suppliers, could lead to delivery delays or failures. we provide merchandise sourcing services to other retailers and licensees and grant credit to these parties in the normal course of business which subjects us to potential credit risk. additionally, we have guaranteed certain lease payments of certain of our former subsidiaries. financial difficulties of our customers or those former subsidiaries for whom we guarantee lease payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. finally, other counterparty failures, including banks and counterparties to contractual arrangements, could negatively impact our business. the global economic crisis could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly. these conditions have affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital. although we believe that our capital structure and credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity, there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. if these conditions continue or become worse, our future cost of debt and equity capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space. most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the high volume of traffic in those retail areas. our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including destination retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from other retail and non-retail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores. recently, sales volume has been adversely affected by the recessionary economic conditions. part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. our net sales, operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis. we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. if we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 6 table of contents our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions. our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel, particularly at the store management level, and the integration of new stores into existing operations. there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our financial results and reputation. we intend to further expand into international markets through franchise/distribution agreements and/or company-owned stores. the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. further, entry into this market may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners as franchisees, distributors or in a similar capacity. in addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales. we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our licensees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images. we have global representation through independently owned la senza stores operated by licensees. although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective licensees, the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees is limited and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our licensees do not operate successfully. our direct channel business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on our results from operations or financial condition. our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results. risks include, but are not limited to, the (a) diversion of sales from our stores, which may impact comparable store sales figures, (b) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels, (c) domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and re-selling it overseas outside our control, (d) risks related to the failure of the systems that operate the web sites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, and (e) risks related to our direct-to-consumer distribution center. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand images. our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. any negative publicity about these types of 7 table of contents concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. our failure to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets. we believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are an essential element of our strategy. we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. if any third-party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, our brand images could be adversely affected. our results can be adversely affected by market disruptions. market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards, terrorist activities, financial crises, political crises or other major events or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect our results or prospects in affected markets. the receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset our losses. our stock price may be volatile. our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. in addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and would increase our interest expense. the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. if our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. additionally, our failure to maintain our credit rating would result in higher interest costs. we may be unable to service our debt. we may be unable to service our outstanding debt or any other debt we incur. additionally, some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements. our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments. if our cash flow from operations is adversely impacted, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt. 8 table of contents our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results. the sale of intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. in addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through direct response channels. brand image, marketing, design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and direct response channels. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. in many cases, our competitors sell their products in department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores. in addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls. increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the recent recessionary conditions have resulted in more significant competition and our competitors have lowered prices and engaged in more promotional activity. our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands. our success depends in part on management ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. if we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. in response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate we are no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions. we may be unable to retain key personnel. it is our belief we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including leslie h. wexner (chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer). the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel. we may be unable to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs. we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store personnel and talented merchants. the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 9 table of contents we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries. we purchase merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market. we do not have any material long-term merchandise supply contracts. many of our imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. we compete with other companies for production facilities. we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as: political instability; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; legal and regulatory matters; currency and exchange risks; local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts; potential delays or disruptions in shipping and related pricing impacts; disruption of imports by labor disputes; and changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation. new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries. in addition, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity. our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk. our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards. we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. similar to most other specialty retailers, we have narrow sales window periods for much of our inventory. factors outside our control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs. energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase product from our manufacturers. a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 10 table of contents we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing. postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly onto our customers or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. we self-insure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience. we are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems. our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. our computer systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, we will make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements. as a public company, we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the sec and the new york stock exchange (the nyse ). failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations and financial condition. we may be adversely impacted by changes in taxation requirements. we are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. in addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. fluctuations in tax rates and duties and changes in tax legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 11 table of contents we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters. we are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. difficulty can exist in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations that affect how we operate. in addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 55 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. we use derivative financial instruments like the cross-currency swaps and the participating interest rate swap arrangement to manage exposure to market risks. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign exchange rate risk our foreign exchange rate translation exposure is primarily the result of the january 2007 acquisition of la senza corporation, whose operations are conducted primarily in canada. to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our investment in la senza associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. these cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate u.s. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and u.s. dollar principal payments upon maturity. the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans. as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related cross-currency swaps, we do not believe there is any material translation risk to la senza net earnings associated with fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate. in addition, our canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada is sourced through u.s. dollar transactions. interest rate risk our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. currently, our investment portfolio is comprised of u.s. and canadian government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, bank time deposits, and highly-rated commercial paper. given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. all of our long-term debt as of january 30, 2010 has fixed interest rates with the exception of our term loan. thus, our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. the term loan contains a variable interest rate that fluctuates based on changes in an underlying benchmark interest rate and changes in our credit rating. in january 2008, we executed a participating interest rate swap arrangement which limited our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rate while allowing us to partially participate in any decreases in the benchmark interest rate. in march 2010, we prepaid the remaining $200 million of the term loan and terminated the remaining portion of the participating interest rate swap arrangement. fair value of financial instruments as of january 30, 2010, management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. 55 table of contents the following table provides a summary of the carrying value and fair value of long-term debt and swap arrangements as of january 30, 2010 and january 31, 2009: january 30, 2010 january 31, 2009 (in millions) long-term debt: carrying value $ 2,725 $ 2,897 fair value, estimated (a) 2,690 2,113 aggregate fair value of cross-currency swap arrangements (b)

term loan is equal to its carrying value. the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. (b) swap arrangements are in an (asset) liability position. the increase in estimated fair value of our long-term debt from january 31, 2009 to january 30, 2010 reflects the decrease in volatility in the credit markets in comparison to 2008. the change in fair value of the cross-currency swap arrangements from january 31, 2009 to january 30, 2010 is primarily due to the fluctuations in the u.s. dollar-canadian dollar exchange rate. the change in fair value of the participating interest rate swap arrangement from january 31, 2009 to january 30, 2010 is primarily due to the termination and settlement of portions of the participating interest rate swap arrangements in conjunction with prepayments of our term loan throughout 2009. concentration of credit risk we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions, as well as corporate commercial paper. currently, our investment portfolio is comprised of u.s. and canadian government obligations, u.s. treasury and aaa-rated money market funds, bank time deposits, and highly-rated commercial paper. we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions and other entities with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. we also monitor the creditworthiness of entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and counterparties to derivative instruments. 56 table of contents safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 limited brands, inc. cautions that any forward-looking

we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. all of our long-term debt as of january 29, 2011 has fixed interest rates. in june 2010, we entered into a series of interest rate swap arrangements related to all of our outstanding 2012 notes, all of our outstanding 2014 notes and $175 million of our outstanding 2017 notes. in august 2010, we terminated $21 million of these interest rate swap arrangements in conjunction with the repurchase of $20 million and $1 million of 2014 notes and 2012 notes, respectively. in january 2011, we entered into a series of interest rate swap arrangements related to an additional $150 million of our outstanding 2017 notes. the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate. the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the three-month
