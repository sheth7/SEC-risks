risk factors. there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business. the significant risk factors are discussed below. please also see the outlook section in item 7 of this form 10-k for forward-looking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations. c ompetitive e nvironment the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, aggressive supercenter expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation. we have developed a strategic plan that we believe is a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment. however, the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition - including our execution of our strategic plan - and our response to these competitive actions, can adversely affect our profitability. our profitability and growth could also be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. f ood afety customers count on kroger to provide them with wholesome food products. concerns regarding the safety of food products sold by kroger could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. as such, any issue regarding the safety of any food items sold by kroger, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations. l abor r elations a significant majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including any work stoppages, could have an adverse impact on our financial results. we are a party to approximately 330 collective bargaining agreements. we have major contracts expiring in 2008 covering store employees in columbus, indianapolis, las vegas, louisville, nashville, phoenix and portland. in future negotiations with labor unions, we expect that rising health care, pension and employee benefit costs, among other issues, will continue to be important topics for negotiation. upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate acceptable contracts with labor unions. this could significantly disrupt our operations. further, if we are unable to control health care, pension and wage costs, or gain operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse impact on future results of operations. trategy e xecution our strategy focuses on improving our customers shopping experience through enhanced service, product selection and value. successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth. maintaining this strategy requires the ability to identify and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customer-focused programs, as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required. if we are unable to execute our plans, or if our plans fail to meet our customers expectations, our sales and earnings growth expectations could be adversely affected. data and technology our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations. if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. additionally, these systems contain valuable proprietary data that, if breached, would have an adverse effect on kroger. 3 i ndebtedness as of year-end 2007, kroger outstanding indebtedness, including capital leases and financing obligations, totaled approximately $8.1 billion. this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness. changes in our credit ratings, or in the interest rate environment, could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure. l egal p roceedings from time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, antitrust claims and other proceedings. some of these proceedings, including product liability cases, could result in a substantial loss to kroger in the event that other potentially responsible parties are unable (for financial reasons or otherwise) to satisfy a judgment entered against them. others purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties. we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities. assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. while we currently do not expect any outstanding legal proceedings to have a material effect on the financial condition of kroger, unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. please also refer to the legal proceedings section in item 3 below. m ulti -e mployer p ost -r etirement o bligations as discussed in more detail below in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies- post-retirement benefit plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. in addition to future contribution obligations that kroger may have under those plans, there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on the company debt securities. any downgrading of kroger debt ratings likely would increase kroger cost of borrowing. i nsurance we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers liability, and employee health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. as a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. to do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status. as of february 2, 2008, we maintained six interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling approximately $1,050 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. these agreements mature at varying times between march 2008 and january 2015. the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. as of february 2, 2008, other long-term assets totaling $11 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt. in addition to the interest rate swaps noted above, in 2005 the company entered into three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $750 million. in 2007, the company terminated two of these forward-starting interest rate swaps in a notional amount of $500 million. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates on debt for an established period of time. the company entered into the forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in 2007 and 2008. the unamortized payment and proceeds on the two terminated forward-starting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedges relate are made. the one remaining forward-starting interest rate swap as of february 2, 2008 has a ten-year term with a fixed interest rate of 5.11%. as of february 2, 2008, other long-term liabilities totaling $18 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of this agreement. during 2003, we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that we accounted for as fair value hedges. we recorded approximately $114 million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and they are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt. as of february 2, 2008, the unamortized balances totaled approximately $33 million. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. 28 the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of february 2, 2008. the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of february 2, 2008. interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on u.s. dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 2, 2008. the fair-value column includes the fair-value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of february 2, 2008. refer to notes 5, 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements: expected year of maturity fair 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 thereafter total value (in millions)

interest rate cuts in march 2008. commodity price protection we enter into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases. some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging. we sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so. as of february 2, 2008, we maintained three derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in corrugated cardboard prices. these derivatives contain a three-year term. the instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, in accordance with sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities , as amended. accordingly, changes in the fair value of these instruments are marked-to-market in our consolidated statements of operations in og&amp;a expenses. as of february 2, 2008, an accrued liability totaling $1 million had been recorded to reflect the fair value of these instruments. 29risk factors. there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our

collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. the funding status of most of those pension funds has deteriorated, and it is probable that the company contributions to those funds will increase significantly over the next several years. despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the

declined and experienced volatility due to uncertainties related to energy prices, availability of credit, difficulties in the banking and financial services sectors, the decline in the housing market, diminished market liquidity, falling consumer confidence and rising unemployment rates. as a result, consumers are more cautious. this could lead to reduced consumer spending, to consumers switching to a less expensive mix of products, or to consumers trading down to discounters for grocery items, all of which could affect our sales growth. we are unable to predict when the global

agencies that rate kroger outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities. any downgrading of kroger

consumer spending, to consumers switching to a less expensive mix of products, and to consumers trading down to discounters for grocery items, all of which has affected and could continue to affect our sales growth and earnings. in 2009, we experienced overall deflation, excluding fuel. in this uncertain economy, it is difficult to forecast whether 2010 will be a period of inflation or deflation. food deflation could reduce sales growth and earnings, while food inflation, combined with reduced consumer spending, could reduce gross profit margins and earnings. we are unable to predict when the global economy and financial markets will improve. if the global economy and financial markets do not improve, or if they worsen, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 5 w eather and n atural d isasters a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes. weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities; could interrupt the delivery of products to our stores; could substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials; and could substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities. although our geographic diversity minimizes the risk that a natural disaster will impair the operation of the company as a whole, adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. g overnment r egulation our stores are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business. we must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages, and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages. we cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. they could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business. they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards. we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated. these changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of

underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. to do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status. as of january 30, 2010, we maintained 18 interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $1.6 billion, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. these agreements mature at varying times between april 2012 and april 2013, and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities. the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. as of january 30, 2010, other long-term assets totaling $26 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt. we have unamortized proceeds from twelve interest rate swaps once classified as fair value hedges totaling approximately $31 million. the unamortized proceeds are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. in addition to the interest rate swaps noted above, in 2005 we entered into three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $750 million. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates on debt for an established period of time. we entered into the forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in 2007 and 2008. in 2007, we terminated two of these forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $500 million. in 2008, we terminated the remaining forward interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million. as of january 30, 2010, the unamortized payments and proceeds of $11 million ($7 million net of tax) on these terminated forward-starting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedge relates are made. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of january 30, 2010. the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of january 30, 2010. interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on u.s. dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 30, 2010. the fair-value column includes the fair-value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of january

commodity price protection we enter into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, warehouses,

which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases. 31risk factors. there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business. the significant risk factors are discussed below. please also see the outlook section in item 7 of this form 10-k for forward-looking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations. competitive environment the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, aggressive supercenter expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation. we have developed a strategic plan that we believe is a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment. however, the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition, including our execution of our strategic plan, and our response to these competitive actions, can adversely affect our profitability. our profitability and growth have been and could continue to be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending, including discretionary spending. food safety customers count on kroger to provide them with wholesome food products. concerns regarding the safety of food products could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside our control. any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. any issue regarding the safety of food items sold by kroger, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations. labor relations a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations, could have a material adverse effect on our results. we are a party to approximately 300 collective bargaining agreements. we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2011, covering store employees in southern california, memphis and west virginia. the company will also negotiate agreements with the teamsters who represent some of our associates in distribution and manufacturing operations in the midwest. upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions. a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results. further, if we are unable to control health care, pension and wage costs, or have sufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on future results of operations. strategy execution our strategy focuses on improving our customers shopping experiences through improved service, product selection and price. successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth. maintaining this strategy requires the ability to develop and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customer-focused programs, as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required. if we are unable to execute our plans, or if our plans fail to meet our customers expectations, our sales and earnings growth could be adversely affected. data and technology our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations. if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. 4 through our sales and marketing activities, we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us. we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business. under certain circumstances, we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business, as required by law, or with the permission of the individual. although we have implemented procedures to protect that information, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. in addition, a kroger associate, contractor, or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or inadvertently cause a breach involving the information. loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations, associates, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. indebtedness as of year-end 2010, kroger outstanding indebtedness, including capital leases and financing obligations, totaled approximately $7.9 billion. this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness. changes in our credit ratings, or in the interest rate environment, could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure. legal proceedings from time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, antitrust claims and other proceedings. others purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties. some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger. we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities, where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. please also refer to the legal proceedings section in item 3 below. multi-employer pension obligations as discussed in more detail below in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies- post-retirement benefit plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. the funding status of most of those pension funds has deteriorated since year-end 2007, and it is probable that the company contributions to those funds will have meaningful increases over the next few years. a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company, there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities. any downgrading of kroger debt ratings likely would affect kroger cost of borrowing and access to capital. insurance we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers liability, and employee health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 5 current economic conditions the global economy and financial markets have experienced volatility due to uncertainties related to energy prices, availability of credit, difficulties in the banking and financial services sectors, the decline in the housing market, diminished market liquidity, falling consumer confidence and rising unemployment rates. as a result, consumers have been more cautious. consumers have reduced spending and have switched to less expensive mixes of products. they also have been patronizing discounters and dollar stores for grocery items to a greater extent, all of which has affected and could continue to affect our sales growth and earnings. unrest in the oil-producing countries has resulted in increased fuel prices that could have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell. our ability to pass higher prices along to consumers due to inflation or other reasons could have an effect on consumer spending. we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform. if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation, or cash flows. weather and natural disasters a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes. weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities; could interrupt the delivery of products to our stores; could substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials; and could substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities. although our geographic diversity minimizes the risk that a natural disaster will impair the operation of the company as a whole, adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. government regulation our stores are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business. we must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages, and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages. we cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. they could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business. they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards. we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated. these changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. we do not enter into derivative

pension obligations as discussed in more detail below in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies- multi-employer pension plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi-employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and it is probable that the company contributions to those funds will have meaningful increases over the next few years. a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company, except as noted below, there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities. any downgrading of kroger debt ratings likely would affect kroger cost of borrowing and access to capital. we also currently bear the investment risk of one of the larger multi-employer pension plans in which we participate. we committed to contribute sufficient funds to cover the actual cost of current accruals and to fund the pre-consolidation unfunded actuarial accrued liability ( uaal ) that existed as of december 31, 2011, on or before march 31, 2018. we also have been designated as the named fiduciary of this fund with sole investment authority of the assets of the fund. if investment results fail to meet our expectations, we will be responsible for the shortfall. 5 insurance we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers liability, and employee health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. current economic conditions the global economy and financial

our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. to do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status. as of january 28, 2012, we maintained 18 interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $1.6 billion, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. these agreements mature at varying times between april 2012 and april 2013, and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities. the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. as of january 28, 2012, other long-term assets totaling $25 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, primarily offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt. we have unamortized proceeds from nine interest rate swaps once classified as fair value hedges totaling approximately $5 million. the unamortized proceeds are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. as of january 28, 2012, we maintained 24 forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates between may 2012 and april 2013 with an aggregate notional amount totaling $1.2 billion. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. we entered into the forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. the fixed interest rates for these forward-starting interest rate swaps range from 2.15% to 3.26%. the variable rate component of the forward-starting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor. accordingly, the forward-starting interest rate swaps were designated as cash-flow hedges as defined by gaap. as of january 28, 2012, the fair value of the interest rates swaps was recorded in other long term liabilities for $41 million and accumulated other comprehensive loss for $26 million net of tax. in addition, in 2005, we entered into three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $750 million. we entered into the forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in 2007 and 2008. in 2007, we terminated two of these forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $500 million. in 2008, we terminated the remaining forward interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million. as of january 28, 2012, the unamortized payments and proceeds of $5 million ($3 million net of tax) on these terminated forward-starting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedge relates are made. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. 31 the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of january 28, 2012 and january 29, 2011. the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 28, 2012 and january 29, 2011. interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on u.s. dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 28, 2012 and january 29, 2011. the fair-value column includes the fair-value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges

derivatives and hedging policies. 32 commodity price protection we enter into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases. 33risk factors. there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business. the significant risk factors are discussed below. please also see the outlook section in item 7 of this form 10-k for forward-looking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations. competitive environment the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, aggressive supercenter expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation. we have developed a strategic plan that we believe provides a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment. however, the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition, including our execution of our strategic plan, and our response to these competitive actions, can adversely affect our profitability. our profitability and growth have been and could continue to be adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending, including discretionary spending. product safety customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs, and other merchandise. concerns regarding the safety of the products that kroger sells could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. any issue regarding the safety of items sold by kroger, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations. labor relations a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations, could have a material adverse effect on our results. we are a party to approximately 300 collective bargaining agreements. we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2013, covering store employees in indianapolis, houston, dallas, cincinnati and seattle, among others. upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions. a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results. further, if we are unable to control health care, pension and wage costs, or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on future results of operations. strategy execution our strategy focuses on improving our customers shopping experiences through improved service, product selection and price. successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth. maintaining this strategy requires the ability to develop and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customer-focused programs, as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required. if we are unable to execute our plans, or if our plans fail to meet our customers expectations, our sales and earnings growth could be adversely affected. data and technology our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations. if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. 4 through our sales and marketing activities, we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us. we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business. under certain circumstances, we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business, as required by law, or with the permission of the individual. although we have implemented procedures to protect our information, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. in addition, a kroger associate, or a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or inadvertently cause a breach involving information. loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations, associates, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. indebtedness as of year-end 2013, kroger outstanding indebtedness, including capital leases and financing obligations, totaled approximately $8.9 billion. this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures. if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness. changes in our credit ratings, or in the interest rate environment, could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure. legal proceedings from time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, antitrust claims and other proceedings. other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties. some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger. we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities, where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. please also refer to the legal proceedings section in item 3 below. multi-employer pension obligations as discussed in more detail below in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies- multi-employer pension plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that the company contributions to those funds, excluding all payments to the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan, will increase over the next few years. a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company, except as noted below, there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities. any downgrading of kroger debt ratings likely would affect kroger cost of borrowing and access to capital. we also currently bear the investment risk of one of the larger multi-employer pension plans in which we participate. in addition, we have been designated as the named fiduciary of this fund with sole investment authority of the assets of the fund. if investment results fail to meet our expectations, we could be responsible for the shortfall. 5 insurance we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers liability, and employee health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. current economic conditions the global economy and financial markets have experienced volatility due to uncertainties related to energy prices, availability of credit, difficulties in the banking and financial services sectors, the decline in the housing market, diminished market liquidity, low consumer confidence and high unemployment rates. as a result, consumers have been more cautious. consumers have reduced spending and have switched to less expensive mixes of products. they also have been patronizing discounters and dollar stores for grocery items to a greater extent, all of which has affected and could continue to affect our sales growth and earnings. increased fuel prices could have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell. our ability to pass higher prices along to consumers due to inflation or other reasons could have an effect on consumer spending. we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform. if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation, or cash flows. weather and natural disasters a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes. weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities, interrupt the delivery of products to our stores, substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities. adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. government regulation our stores are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business. we must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages, and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages. we cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. they could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business. they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards. we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated. these changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. as a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps. our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. to do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status. as of february 2, 2013, we maintained 6 interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $475 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. these agreements mature at varying times between april 2013 and december 2018, and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities. the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. as of february 2, 2013, other long-term assets totaling $1 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, primarily offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt. as of february 2, 2013, we maintained 17 forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates between april 2013 and january 2014 with an aggregate notional amount totaling $850 million. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. we entered into the forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal year 2013. the fixed interest rates for these forward-starting interest rate swaps range from 2.00% to 3.05%. the variable rate component of the forward-starting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor. accordingly, the forward-starting interest rate swaps were designated as cash-flow hedges as defined by gaap. as of february 2, 2013, the fair value of the interest rates swaps was recorded in other investments for $5 million and accumulated other comprehensive income for $3 million net of tax. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of february 2, 2013 and january 28, 2012. the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 2, 2013 and january 28, 2012. interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on u.s. dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 2, 2013 and january 28, 2012. the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest

enter into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases. 36risk factors. there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business. the

and arizona, and an agreement with teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions. a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our

predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have

obligations as discussed in more detail below in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies- multi-employer pension plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that the company contributions to those funds, excluding all payments to the united food and commercial workers international union ( ufcw ) consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan, will increase over the next few years. a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company, except as noted below, there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities. any downgrading of kroger debt ratings likely

addition, we have been designated as the named fiduciary of this fund with sole investment authority of the assets of the fund. if investment results fail to meet our expectations, we could be responsible for the shortfall, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 5 integration of new business we enter into mergers and acquisitions with expected benefits including, among other things, operating efficiencies, procurement savings, innovation, sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth. achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of geographically separate organizations, the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses and delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. insurance we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers liability, and employee health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. fuel we sell a significant amount of gasoline, which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases. the effect on the environment could be manifested by extreme weather conditions, such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. we are unable to predict future regulations, environmental effects, political unrest, acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel, and how our customers will react, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. current economic conditions the economic recovery remains fragile and uneven. our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending. increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell. our ability to pass higher prices along to consumers due to inflation or other reasons could have an effect on consumer spending. we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform. if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows weather and natural disasters a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes. weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities, interrupt the delivery of products to our stores, substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities. adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 6 government regulation our stores are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business. we must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages, and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages. we cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. they could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business. they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards. we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated. these changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. as a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program, variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. to do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status. as of february 1, 2014, we maintained 2 interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $100 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. these agreements mature in december 2018, and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities. the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. as of february 1, 2014, other long-term liabilities totaling $2 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, primarily offset by decreases in the fair value of the underlying debt. as of february 1, 2014, we maintained no forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. periodically, we will enter into the forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our future forecasted issuances of debt. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of february 1, 2014 and february 2, 2013. the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 1, 2014 and february 2, 2013. interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on u.s. dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 1, 2014 and february 2, 2013. the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 1, 2014 and february 2, 2013. refer to notes 6, 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 33 february 1, 2014 expected year of maturity 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 thereafter total fair value (in millions)

resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases. 34risk factors. there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business. the significant risk factors are discussed below. the following information should be read together with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the outlook section in item 7 of this form 10-k, which include forward-looking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations. competitive environment the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, aggressive expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation. we have developed a strategic plan that we believe provides a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment. however, the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition, including our execution of our strategic plan, and our response to these competitive actions, can adversely affect our profitability. our profitability and growth have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending, including discretionary spending. product safety customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise. concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. any issue regarding the safety of items we sell, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. labor relations a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations, could have a material adverse effect on our results. we are a party to approximately 300 collective bargaining agreements. upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions. a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results. further, if we are unable to control health care, pension and wage costs, or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. data and technology our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations. if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. through our sales and marketing activities, we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us. we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business. under certain circumstances, we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business, as required by law, or with the permission of the individual. although we have implemented procedures to protect our information, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. in addition, a kroger associate, a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information. loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations, associates, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. 4 indebtedness our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures. if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness. changes in our credit ratings, or in the interest rate environment, could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure. legal proceedings and insurance from time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, antitrust claims and other proceedings. other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties. some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger. we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities, where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. please also refer to the legal proceedings section in item 3 and the litigation section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers liability, and employee health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. multi-employer pension obligations as discussed in more detail below in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies- multi-employer pension plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that kroger contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years. a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company, except as noted below, there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities. any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital. we also currently bear the investment risk of one of the larger multi-employer pension plans in which we participate. in addition, we have been designated as the named fiduciary of this fund with sole investment authority of the assets of the fund. if investment results fail to meet our expectations, we could be responsible for the shortfall, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. integration of new business we enter into mergers and acquisitions with expected benefits including, among other things, operating efficiencies, procurement savings, innovation, sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth. achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of geographically separate organizations, the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses and delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or cash flows. 5 fuel we sell a significant amount of gasoline, which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases. we are unable to predict future regulations, environmental effects, political unrest, acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel, and how our customers will react, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. economic conditions our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending. increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell. our ability to pass higher prices along to consumers due to inflation or other reasons could have an effect on consumer spending. we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform. if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows weather and natural disasters a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes. weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities, interrupt the delivery of products to our stores, substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities. adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. government regulation our stores are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business. we must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages, and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages. we cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. they could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business. they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards. we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated. these changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity

mark-to-market status. as of january 31, 2015, we maintained two interest rate swap agreements, with an aggregate notional amount totaling $100 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. these agreements mature in december 2018, and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities. the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. as of january 31, 2015, we maintained 11 forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates between october 2015 and august 2017 with an aggregate notional amount totaling $700 million. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. we entered into these forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal years 2015 and 2017. the fixed interest rates for these forward-starting interest rate swaps range from 2.28% to 3.00%. the variable rate component on the forward-starting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor. accordingly, the forward-starting interest rate swaps were designated as cash-flow hedges as defined by gaap. as of january 31, 2015, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other long-term liabilities for $39 million and accumulated other comprehensive income for $25 million net of tax. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of january 31, 2015 and february 1, 2014. the amounts shown for

fund a portion of or the entire shortfall, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 5 i ntegration of n ew b usiness we enter into mergers and acquisitions with expected benefits including, among other things, operating efficiencies, procurement savings, innovation, sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth. achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of geographically separate organizations, the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses and delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or cash flows. f uel we sell a significant amount of fuel, which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases. we are unable to predict future regulations, environmental effects, political unrest, acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel, and how our customers will react, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. e conomic c onditions our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending. increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell. we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform. if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. w eather and n atural d isasters a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes. weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities, interrupt the delivery of products to our stores, substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities. adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. g overnment r egulation our stores are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business. we must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages, and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages. we cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. they could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business. they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards. we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated. these changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 6 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. as a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program, variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. to do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status. as of january 30, 2016, we maintained two interest rate swap agreements, with an aggregate notional amount totaling $100 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. these agreements mature in december 2018, and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities. the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. as of january 30, 2016, we maintained 7 forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates of august 15, 2027 with an aggregate notional amount totaling $400 million. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. we entered into these forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal year 2017. the fixed interest rates for these forward-starting interest rate swaps range from 2.54% to 3.00%. the variable rate component on the forward-starting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor. accordingly, the forward-starting interest rate swaps were designated as cash-flow hedges as defined by gaap. as of january 30, 2016, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other long-term liabilities for $29 million and accumulated other comprehensive income for $17 million net of tax. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015. the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015. interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on u.s. dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015. the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015. see

energy to be used in our stores, warehouses, food production plants and administrative offices. we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases. 34quantitative and

manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. to do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status. as of january 29, 2005, we maintained ten interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling approximately $1,375 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. these agreements mature at varying times between july 2006 and january 2015. variable rates for our agreements are based on u.s. dollar london interbank offered rate ( libor ). the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. these agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges. all interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. as of january 29, 2005, liabilities totaling $11 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, offset by decreases in the fair value of the underlying debt. during 2003, we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that were accounted for as fair value hedges. approximately $114 million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations were recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt. as of january 29, 2005, the unamortized balances totaled approximately $81. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt

basis. some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging. we sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so. in the fourth quarter of 2004, we entered into six derivative instruments to protect us from declining corrugated cardboard prices. the derivatives, accounted for as cash flow hedges, contain a three-year term. none of the contracts, either individually or in the aggregate, hedge more than 50% of our expected corrugated cardboard sales. as of january 29, 2005, a liability totaling $1.7 million had been recorded for the instruments. corresponding charges were recorded as other comprehensive loss, net of income tax effects.risk factors. there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business. the significant risk factors are discussed below. please also see the outlook section in item 7 of this form 10-k for additional uncertainties and other risk factors that could adversely affect our business. c ompetitive e nvironment the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, aggressive supercenter expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation. we have developed a strategic plan that we believe is a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers. however, the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition - including our execution of our strategic plan - and our response to these competitive actions, can adversely affect our profitability. f ood afety customers count on kroger to provide them with wholesome food products. concerns regarding the safety of food products sold by kroger could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. as such, any issue regarding the safety of any food items sold by kroger, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations. l abor r elations a significant majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including any work stoppages, could have an adverse impact on our financial results. we are a party to approximately 325 collective bargaining agreements, of which 85 of the contracts, covering fewer employees than those that expired in 2005, are scheduled to expire in 2006. these expiring agreements cover approximately 8% of our union-affiliated employees. in future negotiations with labor unions, we expect that rising health care, pension and employee benefit costs, among other issues, will continue to be important topics for negotiation. upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate acceptable contracts with labor unions. this could significantly disrupt our operations. further, if we are unable to control health care and pension costs provided for in the collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse impact on future results of operations. trategy e xecution our strategy focuses on improving our customers shopping experience through enhanced service, product selection and value. successful execution of this strategy requires a balance between sales growth and earnings growth. maintaining this strategy requires the ability to identify and execute plans to generate cost savings and productivity improvements that can be invested in the merchandising and pricing initiatives necessary to support our customer-focused programs, as well as recognizing and implementing organizational changes as required. if we are unable to identify or execute plans that generate the requisite amount of cost savings necessary to execute our strategy and to meet our customers expectations, our sales and earnings growth expectations could be adversely affected. i ndebtedness as of year-end 2005, kroger outstanding indebtedness, including capital leases and financing obligations, totaled approximately $7.2 billion. this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. our need for cash in the future will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict. these factors include results of operations, the timing and cost of acquisitions and efforts to expand existing operations. we believe that we will have sufficient funds from all sources to meet our needs over the next several years. l egal p roceedings from time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, antitrust claims and other proceedings. some of these proceedings, including product liability cases, could result in a substantial loss to kroger in the event that other potentially responsible parties are unable (for financial reasons or otherwise) to satisfy a judgment entered against them. others purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties. we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities. assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. while we currently do not expect any outstanding legal proceeding to have a material effect on the financial condition of kroger, unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. please also refer to the legal proceedings section in item 3 below. m ulti - e mployer p ost -r etirement o bligations as discussed in more detail below in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation-critical accounting policies- post-retirement benefit plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. in addition to future contribution obligations that kroger may have under those plans, there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on the company debt securities. any downgrading of kroger debt ratings likely would increase kroger cost of borrowing. i nsurance we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance, and employee health care benefits. the liabilities that have been recorded for these claims represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january 28, 2006. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage

totaling $34 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, offset by decreases in the fair value of the underlying debt. in addition, as of january 28, 2006, we maintained three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $750 million, to manage our exposure to changes in future benchmark interest rates. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates, including general corporate spreads, on debt for an established period of time. we entered into the forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of debt in fiscal 2007 and 2008. accordingly, these instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges for our forecasted debt issuances. two of these swaps have ten-year terms, with the remaining swap having a twelve-year term, beginning with the issuance of the debt. the average fixed rate for these instruments is 5.14%, and the variable rate will be determined at the inception date of the swap. as of january 28, 2006, we had recorded other long-term liabilities totaling $2 million to reflect the fair value of these agreements. during 2003, we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that were accounted for as fair value hedges. approximately $114 million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations were recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt. as of january 28, 2006, the unamortized

are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business. the significant risk factors are discussed below. please also see the outlook section in item 7 of this form 10-k for forward-looking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations. c ompetitive e nvironment the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, aggressive supercenter expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation. additionally, consumers are increasingly looking to restaurants to fulfill their food product needs. we have developed a strategic plan that we believe is a balanced approach that will enable kroger to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers. however, the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition

regarding the safety of any food items sold by kroger, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our operations. l abor r elations a significant majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including any work stoppages, could have an adverse impact on our financial results. we are a party to approximately 320 collective bargaining agreements. we have major contracts expiring in 2007 in southern california, cincinnati, detroit, houston, memphis, toledo, seattle and west virginia. in future negotiations with labor unions, we expect that rising health care, pension and employee benefit costs, among other issues, will continue to be important topics for negotiation. upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate acceptable contracts with labor unions. this could significantly disrupt our operations. further, if we are unable to control health care, pension and wage costs, or gain operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse impact on future results of operations. trategy e xecution our strategy focuses on improving our customers shopping experience through enhanced service,

to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. additionally, these systems contain valuable proprietary data that, if breached, would have an adverse effect on kroger. i ndebtedness as of year-end 2006, kroger outstanding indebtedness, including capital leases and financing obligations, totaled approximately $7.1 billion. this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness. changes in our credit ratings, or in the interest rate environment, could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure. l egal p roceedings from time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, antitrust claims and other proceedings. some of these proceedings, including product liability cases, could result in a substantial loss to kroger in the event that other potentially responsible parties are unable (for financial reasons or otherwise) to satisfy a judgment entered against them. others purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties. we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities. assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. while we currently do not expect any outstanding legal proceedings to have a material effect on the financial condition of kroger, unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. please also refer to the legal proceedings section in item 3 below. m ulti -e mployer p ost -r etirement o bligations as discussed in more detail below in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation-critical accounting policies- post-retirement benefit plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. in addition to future contribution obligations that kroger may have under those plans, there is a risk that the agencies that rate kroger outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on the company debt securities. any downgrading of kroger debt ratings likely would increase kroger cost of borrowing. i nsurance we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers liability, and employee health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. as a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. to do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status. as of february 3, 2007, we maintained six interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling approximately $1,050 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. these agreements mature at varying times between march 2008 and january 2015. variable rates for our agreements are based on u.s. dollar london interbank offered rate ( libor ). the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. as of february 3, 2007, other long-term liabilities totaling $28 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, offset by decreases in the fair value of the underlying debt. in addition, as of february 3, 2007, we maintained three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $750 million, to manage our exposure to changes in future benchmark interest rates. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates, including general corporate spreads, on debt for an established period of time. we entered into the forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal 2007 and 2008. accordingly, these instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges for our forecasted debt issuances. two of these swaps have ten-year terms, with the remaining swap having a twelve-year term, beginning with the issuance of the debt. the average fixed rate for these instruments is 5.14%, and the variable rate will be determined at the inception date of the swap. as of february 3, 2007, we had recorded an other asset totaling $12 million to reflect the fair value of these agreements. during 2003, we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that we accounted for as fair value hedges. we recorded approximately $114 million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and they are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt. as of february 3, 2007, the unamortized balances totaled approximately $46 million. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of february 3, 2007. the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of february 3, 2007. interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments. the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on u.s. dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 3, 2007. the fair-value column includes the fair-value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of february 3, 2007. refer to notes 5, 6 and 7 to our

stores, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales. for any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and, as a result, will require net settlement, the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis. some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging. we sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so. as of february 3, 2007, we maintained seven derivative instruments to protect us from declining corrugated cardboard prices. these derivatives contain a three-year term. none of the contracts, either individually or in the aggregate, hedge more than 50% of our expected corrugated cardboard sales. the instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, in accordance with sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities , as amended. accordingly, changes in the fair value of these instruments are marked-to-market in our consolidated statements of operations in og&amp;a expenses. as of february 3, 2007, an accrued expense totaling $0.2 million had been recorded for the instruments.risk factors. there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business. the significant risk factors are discussed below. the following information should be read together with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the outlook section in item 7 of this form 10-k, which include forward-looking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations. competitive environment the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, aggressive expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation. we have developed a strategic plan that we believe provides a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment. however, the nature and extent to which our competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition, including our execution of our strategic plan, and our response to these competitive actions, can adversely affect our profitability. our profitability and growth have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by changes in the overall economic environment that affect consumer spending, including discretionary spending. product safety customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise. concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. any issue regarding the safety of items we sell, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. labor relations a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations, could have a material adverse effect on our results. we are a party to approximately 366 collective bargaining agreements. upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions. a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results. further, if we are unable to control health care, pension and wage costs, or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 4 data and technology our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations. if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. through our sales and marketing activities, we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us. we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business. under certain circumstances, we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business, as required by law, or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy. although we have implemented procedures to protect our information, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. in addition, a kroger associate, a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information. loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations, associates, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. additionally, on october 1, 2015, the payment card industry shifted liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept europay, mastercard, visa (emv) transactions. we completed the implementation of the emv technology for more than the majority of our supermarket transactions in 2016 with plans to complete them in 2017, and have a plan in place to complete implementation for our fuel centers prior to the liability shift for fuel centers. indebtedness our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures. if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness. changes in our credit ratings, or in the interest rate environment, could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure. legal proceedings and insurance from time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, antitrust claims and other proceedings. other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties. some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger. we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities, where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. please also refer to the legal proceedings section in item 3 and the litigation section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers liability, and employee health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 5 multi-employer pension obligations as discussed in more detail below in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies- multi-employer pension plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that kroger contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years. a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company, except as noted below, there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities. any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital. we also currently bear the investment risk of one of the larger multi-employer pension plans in which we participate. in addition, we have been designated as the named fiduciary of this fund with sole investment authority of the assets of the fund. if investment results fail to meet our expectations, we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. integration of new business we enter into mergers and acquisitions with expected benefits including, among other things, operating efficiencies, procurement savings, innovation, sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth. achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of geographically separate organizations, the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses and delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or cash flows. fuel we sell a significant amount of fuel, which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases. we are unable to predict future regulations, environmental effects, political unrest, acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel, and how our customers will react, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. economic conditions our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending. increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell. we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform. if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 6 weather and natural disasters a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes. weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities, interrupt the delivery of products to our stores, substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities. adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. government regulation our stores are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business. we must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages, and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages. we cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. they could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business. they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards. we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated. these changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. as a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program, variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. to do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status. as of january 28, 2017, we maintained two interest rate swap agreements, with an aggregate notional amount totaling $100 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. these agreements mature in december 2018, and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities. the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. as of january 28, 2017, we maintained 25 forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates of august 15, 2027, january 15, 2029, january 15, 2049 and january 15, 2050 with an aggregate notional amount totaling $1.6 billion. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. we entered into these forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. the fixed interest rates for these forward-starting interest rate swaps range from 2.07% to 3.00%. the variable rate component on the forward-starting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor. accordingly, the forward-starting interest rate swaps were designated as cash-flow hedges as defined by gaap. as of january 28, 2017, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other assets for $67 million, other long-term liabilities for $7 million and accumulated other comprehensive income for $38 million, net of tax. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. 35 the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of january 28, 2017 and january 30, 2016. the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 28, 2017 and january 30, 2016. interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on u.s. dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january 28, 2017 and january 30, 2016. the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of january 28,

policies. 36risk factors. there are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business. the significant risk factors are discussed below. the following information should be read together with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the outlook section in item 7 of this form 10-k, which include forward-looking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations. competitive environment the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, aggressive expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation. in addition, evolving customer preferences and the advancement of online, delivery, ship to home, and mobile channels in our industry enhance the competitive environment. we believe our restock kroger plan provides a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers. however, we may be unsuccessful in implementing restock kroger , which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, our market share and business growth, and our operations and results. the nature and extent to which our competitors respond to the evolving and competitive industry by developing and implementing their competitive strategies could adversely affect our profitability. product safety customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise. concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. any issue regarding the safety of items we sell, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. labor relations a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations, could have a material adverse effect on our results. we are a party to approximately 360 collective bargaining agreements. upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions. a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results. further, if we are unable to control health care, pension and wage costs, or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 4 data and technology our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations, resulting in an expansion of our technological presence and corresponding risk exposure. if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. through our sales and marketing activities, we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us. we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business. under certain circumstances, we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business, as required by law, or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy. our technology systems are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control. cyber-attackers may attempt to access information stored in our or our vendors systems in order to misappropriate confidential customer or business information. although we have implemented procedures to protect our information, and require our vendors to do the same, we cannot be certain that our security systems will successfully defend against rapidly evolving, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks as they become more difficult to detect and defend against. further, a kroger associate, a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may in the future circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information. in addition, hardware, software or applications we may use may have inherent defects or could be inadvertently or intentionally applied or used in a way that could compromise our information security. our continued investment in our information technology systems may not effectively insulate us from potential attacks, breaches or disruptions to our business operations, which could result in a loss of customers or business information, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, and exposure to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations, associates and other persons. any such events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may not be covered by our insurance. in addition, compliance with privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes and may require us to devote significant management resources to address these issues. additionally, on october 1, 2015, the payment card industry shifted liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept europay, mastercard, visa (emv) transactions. we completed the implementation of the emv technology for our supermarket transactions, and have a plan in place to complete implementation for our fuel centers prior to the liability shift for fuel centers, which will occur in 2020. indebtedness our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures. if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness. changes in our credit ratings, or in the interest rate environment, could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure. legal proceedings and insurance from time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, antitrust claims and other proceedings. other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties. some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger. we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities, where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. please also refer to the legal proceedings section in item 3 and the litigation section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. 5 we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers liability, and employee health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. multi-employer pension obligations as discussed in more detail below in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies- multi-employer pension plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that kroger contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years. a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company, except as noted below, there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably when determining their ratings on our debt securities. any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital. we also currently bear the investment risk of two of the larger multi-employer pension plans in which we participate. in addition, we have been designated as the named fiduciary of these funds with sole investment authority of the assets of these funds. if investment results fail to meet our expectations, we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. integration of new business we enter into mergers and acquisitions with expected benefits including, among other things, operating efficiencies, procurement savings, innovation, sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth. achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of geographically separate organizations, the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses and delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or cash flows. fuel we sell a significant amount of fuel, which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases. we are unable to predict future regulations, environmental effects, political unrest, acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel, and how our customers will react, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 6 economic conditions our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending. increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell. we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform. if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. weather and natural disasters a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes. weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities, interrupt the delivery of products to our stores, substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities. adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. government regulation our stores are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business. we must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages, and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages. we cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. they could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business. they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards. we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated. these changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. as a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program, variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. to do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status. as of february 3, 2018, we maintained two interest rate swap agreements, with an aggregate notional amount totaling $100 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. these agreements mature in december 2018, and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities. the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. as of february 3, 2018, we maintained 14 forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates of january 15, 2019 and january 15, 2020 with an aggregate notional amount totaling $1.0 billion. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. we entered into these forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. the fixed interest rates for these forward-starting interest rate swaps range from 2.15% to 2.48%. the variable rate component on the forward-starting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor. accordingly, the forward-starting interest rate swaps were designated as cash-flow hedges as defined by gaap. as of february 3, 2018, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other assets for $103 million and accumulated other comprehensive income for $73 million, net of tax. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. 36 the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of february 3, 2018 and january 28, 2017. the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 3, 2018 and january 28, 2017. interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on u.s. dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 3, 2018 and january 28, 2017. the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 3, 2018 and january 28, 2017. see notes 6, 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements. february 3, 2018 expected year of maturity 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 thereafter total fair

our business. the significant risk factors are discussed below. the following information should be read together with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the outlook section in item 7 of this form 10-k, which include forward-looking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations. competitive environment the operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation. in addition, evolving customer preferences and the advancement of online, delivery, ship to home, and mobile channels in our industry enhance the competitive environment. we believe our restock kroger plan provides a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers. however, we may be unsuccessful in implementing restock kroger , including our alternative profit strategy and our cost savings initiatives, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, our market share and business growth, and our operations and results. the nature and extent to which our competitors respond to the evolving and competitive industry by developing and implementing their competitive strategies could adversely affect our profitability. product safety customers count on kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise. concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. any issue regarding the safety of items we sell, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. labor relations a majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations, could have a material adverse effect on our results. we are a party to approximately 360 collective bargaining agreements. upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions. a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results. further, if we are unable to control health care, pension and wage costs, or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 4 data and technology our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations, resulting in an expansion of our technological presence and corresponding risk exposure. if we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. through our sales and marketing activities, we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us. we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business. under certain circumstances, we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business, as required by law, or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy. our technology systems are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control. cyber-attackers may attempt to access information stored in our or our vendors systems in order to misappropriate confidential customer or business information. although we have implemented procedures to protect our information, and require our vendors to do the same, we cannot be certain that our security systems will successfully defend against rapidly evolving, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks as they become more difficult to detect and defend against. further, a kroger associate, a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may in the future circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information. in addition, hardware, software or applications we may use may have inherent defects or could be inadvertently or intentionally applied or used in a way that could compromise our information security. our continued investment in our information technology systems may not effectively insulate us from potential attacks, breaches or disruptions to our business operations, which could result in a loss of customers or business information, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, and exposure to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations, associates and other persons. any such events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may not be covered by our insurance. in addition, compliance with privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes and may require us to devote significant management resources to address these issues. additionally, on october 1, 2015, the payment card industry shifted liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept europay, mastercard, visa (emv) transactions. we completed the implementation of the emv technology for our supermarket transactions, and have a plan in place to complete implementation for our fuel centers prior to the liability shift for fuel centers, which will occur in 2020. indebtedness our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures. if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness. changes in our credit ratings, or in the interest rate environment, could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure. legal proceedings and insurance from time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, antitrust claims and other proceedings. other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties. some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger. we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities, where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. please also refer to the legal proceedings section in item 3 and the litigation section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. 5 we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers liability, and employee health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. multi-employer pension obligations as discussed in more detail below in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies- multi-employer pension plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that kroger contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years. a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company, except as noted below, there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably, or adjust their current views unfavorably, when determining their ratings on our debt securities. any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital. we also currently bear the investment risk of two multi-employer pension plans in which we participate. in addition, we have been designated as the named fiduciary of these funds with sole investment authority of the assets of these funds. if investment results fail to meet our expectations, we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. integration of new business we enter into mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances with expected benefits including, among other things, operating efficiencies, procurement savings, innovation, sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth. achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of geographically separate organizations, the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses and delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or cash flows. fuel we sell a significant amount of fuel, which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases. we are unable to predict future regulations, environmental effects, political unrest, acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel, and how our customers will react, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 6 economic conditions our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending. increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell. we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform. if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. weather and natural disasters a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes. weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities, interrupt the delivery of products to our stores, substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities. adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. government regulation our stores are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business. we must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages, and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages. we cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. they could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business. they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards. we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated. these changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.risk factors. there are

operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation. in addition, evolving customer preferences and the advancement of online, delivery, ship to home, and mobile channels in our industry enhance the competitive environment . we must anticipate and meet these evolving customer preferences and continue to implement technology, software and processes to be able to conveniently and cost-effectively fulfill customer orders. providing flexible fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet customer preferences. if we are not successful in offsetting increased cost of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional in-store channel with efficiencies, cost-savings or expense reductions, our results of operations could be adversely affected. if we do not anticipate customer preferences or fail to quickly adapt to these changing preferences, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. if we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. we are continuing to enhance the customer connection with investments in our competitive moats of today which are product freshness and quality, our brands , and personalized rewards and our competitive moat of tomorrow, the seamless ecosystem we are building. if we are unable to enhance the foregoing customer connection, our ability to compete and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected. we believe our restock kroger plan provides a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers. however, we may be unsuccessful in implementing restock kroger , including our alternative profit strategy and our cost savings initiatives, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, our market share and business growth, and our operations and results.

operations, which could result in a loss of customers or business information, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, and exposure to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations, associates and other persons. any such events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may not be covered by our insurance. in addition, compliance with privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes and may require us to devote significant management resources to address these issues. the costs of attempting to protect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to cyber-attacks are significant. following a cyber-attack , our and/or our vendors' remediation efforts may not be successful, and a cyber-attack could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers. in addition, breaches of our and/or our vendors' security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or confidential information about us or our customers could expose our customers' private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and result in investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, loss of customers, litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our brands, reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 9 data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and business. our business depends on our customers' willingness to entrust us with their personal information. events that adversely affect that trust, including inadequate disclosure to our customers of our uses of their information, failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers' sensitive information secure from significant attack, theft, damage, loss or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of our action or inaction (including human error) or that of our business associates, vendors or other third parties, could adversely affect our brand and reputation and operating results and also could expose and/or has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media, litigation (including class action litigation), governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages, consent orders, and/or injunctive relief, any of which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. large scale data breaches at other entities increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers' information. there can be no assurance that such failures will not occur, or if any do occur, that we will detect them or that they can be sufficiently remediated. the use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated. privacy and information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to, among other things, systems changes and the development of new processes. if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations, such as the california consumer privacy act (ccpa), our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses as a result of non-compliance. payment systems we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, and select credit and debit cards. as we offer new payment options to our customers, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. for certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards. it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. we are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. for example, we are subject to payment card industry data security standards ( pci dss ), which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected. indebtedness our indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures. if debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness. changes in our credit ratings, or in the interest rate environment, could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure. legal proceedings and insurance from time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, antitrust claims and other proceedings. other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties. some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to kroger. we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities, where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. please also refer to the legal proceedings section in item 3 and the litigation section in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. 10 we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers' compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers' liability, and employee health care benefits. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. multi-employer pension obligations as discussed in more detail below in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies- multi-employer pension plans , kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that kroger's contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years. a significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the company, except as noted below, there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably, or adjust their current views unfavorably, when determining their ratings on our debt securities. any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital. we also currently bear the investment risk of two multi-employer pension plans in which we participate. in addition, we have been designated as the named fiduciary of these funds with sole investment authority of the assets of these funds. if investment results fail to meet our expectations, we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. integration of new business and strategic alliances we enter into mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances with expected benefits including, among other things, operating efficiencies, procurement savings, innovation, sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth. achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of geographically separate organizations, the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies, capital requirements, and the integration process, unforeseen expenses and delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or cash flows . fuel we sell a significant amount of fuel, which could face increased regulation and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases. we are unable to predict future regulations, environmental effects, political unrest, acts of terrorism, disruptions to the economy, including but not limited to the covid-19 pandemic, and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel, and how our customers will react, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 11 economic conditions our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism or pandemics, such as the spread of the novel coronavirus, covid-19, and other matters could reduce consumer spending. increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell. we are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform. if the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. weather and natural disasters a large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes. weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities, interrupt the delivery of products to our stores, substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities. adverse weather and natural disasters could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. covid-19 on march 11, 2020, the world health organization announced that infections of the coronavirus (covid-19) had become a pandemic, and on march 13, the u.s. president announced a national emergency relating to the disease. there is a possibility of widespread infection in the united states and abroad, with the potential for catastrophic impact. national, state and local authorities have recommended social distancing and imposed or are considering quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures. these measures, while intended to protect human life, are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration. the effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts, including proposed government payments to affected citizens and industries, is uncertain. some economists are predicting the united states may enter a recession as a result of the pandemic. our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern, such as reduced travel or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to self-quarantine as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. these impacts include but are not limited to: increased costs due to short-term significant increases in customer traffic and demand spikes; failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners to meet their obligations to the company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations; supply chain risks such as scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas; reduced workforces which may be caused by, but not limited to, the temporary inability of the workforce to work due to illness, quarantine, or government mandates; temporary store closures due to reduced workforces or government mandates; or reduced consumer traffic and purchasing which may be caused by, but not limited to, the temporary inability of customers to shop with us due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in demand from discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products, or stockpiling or similar pantry-loading activities. 12 any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our sales and damage the company's financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and its liquidity position, possibly to a significant degree. the duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted because of the sweeping nature of the covid-19 pandemic. government regulation our stores are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business. we must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages, licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages, and new provisions relating to the covid-19 pandemic. we cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. they could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business. they also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards. we also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated. these changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. as a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program, variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. to do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total amount that represents 25% of the carrying value of our debt portfolio or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status. as of february 1, 2020, we maintained seven forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a maturity date of january 15, 2021 with an aggregate notional amount totaling $350 million. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. we entered into these forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in january 2021. the fixed interest rates for these forward-starting interest rate swaps range from 1.57% to 2.45%. the variable rate component on the forward-starting interest rate swaps is 3 month libor. accordingly, the forward-starting interest rate swaps were designated as cash-flow hedges as defined by gaap. as of february 1, 2020, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other long-term liabilities for $19 million and accumulated other comprehensive loss for $17 million, net of tax. annually, we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above. the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. 39 the tables below provide information about our underlying debt portfolio as of february 1, 2020 and february 2, 2019. the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding finance leases, as of february 1, 2020 and february 2, 2019. interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. the variable rate debt is based on u.s. dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february 1, 2020 and february 2, 2019. the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments as of february 1, 2020 and february 2, 2019. we have no outstanding interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february 1, 2020 or february 2, 2019. see notes 6, 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements. february 1,
