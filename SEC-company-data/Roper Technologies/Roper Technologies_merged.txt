quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at october 31, 2002, we had a combination of fixed-rate borrowings (primarily $125 million of term notes) and relatively variable-rate borrowings (primarily borrowings under the $275 million credit facility). although each borrowing under the $275 million credit facility has a fixed rate, the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only 1-3 months. at october 31, 2002, prevailing market interest rates were lower than the fixed rates on the term notes by 2-3 percentage points. this resulted in the estimated fair values of the term notes using a discounted cash flows model being greater than the face amounts of the notes by an estimated $15.6 million and it represented an unrecorded decrease in our net assets at october 31, 2002. there was a comparable unrecorded decrease in our net assets of $11.7 million at october 31, 2001. if interest rates had been 1% higher at october 31, 2002, the difference between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would have been approximately $7.1 million smaller. these interest rate differences do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. at october 31, 2002, roper outstanding variable-rate borrowings under the $275 million credit facility were $186.4 million. an increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $1.9 million. several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, british pounds, danish krone or japanese yen. sales by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 28% of our total sales and 80% of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency. the u.s. dollar weakened against these european currencies during fiscal 2002 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies. the difference between fiscal 2002 operating results for these companies translated into u.s. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2002 and these operating results translated into u.s. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2001 was not material. if these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout fiscal 2002 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $2 million. the changes of these currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar during fiscal 2002 compared to currency exchange rates at october 31, 2001 resulted in an increase in net assets of $13.7 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $10.9 million of which was attributed to goodwill. goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. the trading price of roper common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. the stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share. the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at december 31, 2003 we had a combination of fixed-rate borrowings (primarily our $230 million senior subordinated convertible notes) and relatively variable rate borrowings under the $625 million credit facility. our $400 million 5-year term note under this credit facility was variable at a spread over libor. any borrowings under the $225 million revolver have a fixed rate, but the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only 1-3 months. subsequent to year end, we fixed the interest rate at 4.108% on $100 million of the term note for a period of two years. at december 31, 2003, there was no material difference between prevailing market rates and the fixed rate on our debt instruments. at december 31, 2003, roper outstanding variable-rate borrowings under the $625 million credit facility were $420 million. an increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $3.2 million. several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, british pounds, danish krone or japanese yen. sales by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 27% of our total sales and 77% of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency. the u.s. dollar weakened against these european currencies during fiscal 2003 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies. the difference between fiscal 2003 operating results for these companies translated into u.s. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2003 and these operating results translated into u.s. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2002 was not material. if these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout fiscal 2003 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $1.4 million. the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar during fiscal 2003 compared to currency exchange rates at october 31, 2002 resulted in an increase in net assets of $43.0 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $33.6 million of which was attributed to goodwill. goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. the trading price of roper common

exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at december 31, 2004, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. our $1.055 billion senior credit facility contains $655 million variable rate term notes and a $400 million variable rate revolver. to reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, the company entered into fixed rate swap agreements, including a $100 million agreement expiring january 6, 2006, and, subsequent to year end, a $250 million agreement expiring march 13, 2008. our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate. at december 31, 2004, there was no material difference between prevailing market rates and the fixed rate on our debt instruments. at december 31, 2004, roper outstanding variable-rate borrowings under the $1.055 billion credit facility were $555 million. an increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.6 million (before accounting for the $250 million fixed rate swap agreement which we entered into subsequent to year end). several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, british pounds, danish krone or japanese yen. sales by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 36% of our total sales and 77% of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency. the u.s. dollar weakened against these european currencies during 2004 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies. the difference between 2004 operating results for these companies translated into u.s. dollars during 2004 and these operating results translated into u.s. dollars during 2003 was not material. if these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2004 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $2.9 million. the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar during 2004 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31, 2003 resulted in an increase in net assets of $27.3 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $19.5 million of which was attributed to goodwill. goodwill changes from currency

earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.risk factors risks relating to our business our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. as of december 31, 2005, we had approximately $894 million in total consolidated indebtedness. in addition, we had approximately $315 million undrawn availability under our senior secured credit facility. our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity. subject to certain restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facility and other debt agreements, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or which is assumed in connection with, acquisitions. our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. for example, our indebtedness could: limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than us; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; limit our ability to complete future acquisitions; limit our ability to pay dividends; limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. in addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. if we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. in addition, our senior secured credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our senior secured credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facility could result in an event of default under this facility, which in turn could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior secured credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness. unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business. several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds, danish krone and japanese yen. sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar represented approximately 25% of our total net sales for the year ended december 31, 2005 compared to 31% for the year ended december 31, 2004. unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings. at present, we do not hedge against foreign currency risks. we export a significant portion of our products. difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business. sales to customers outside the u.s. by our businesses located in the u.s. account for a significant portion of our net sales. these sales accounted for approximately 16% and 19% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2005 and december 31, 2004, respectively. we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets. such risks include, without limitation, the following: unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export requirements; restrictions on the export of technology and related products; unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries; unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and a general economic downturn in our foreign markets. the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could materially negatively affect our future sales and earnings. economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business. as of december 31, 2005, approximately 16% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the u.s. we expect our international operations to continue to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the u.s. including, without limitation, the following: adverse changes in a specific country or region political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets; trade protection measures and import or export requirements; trade liberalization measures which could expose our international operations to increased competition; subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are currently, or may emerge, as competitors in countries in which we have operations; partial or total expropriation; potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty in collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions; and international sentiment towards the u.s. the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business. our growth strategy includes acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully. our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, to some degree on our ability to make acquisitions and to successfully integrate acquired businesses. we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets globally. there are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues, profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management attention from other business concerns. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. we cannot assure you that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. product liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results. our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacturing and distribution of our products. in addition, certain of our products are used in potentially hazardous environments. we currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against potential losses. we also maintain other insurance policies, including directors and officers liability insurance. our insurance costs increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future. we believe that we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. however, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results. our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers. we derive a significant amount of revenue from larger customers. the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows. additionally, many of our customers are government entities. government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency. we face intense competition. if we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. we face intense competition from numerous competitors. our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities with existing customers. we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. in addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner. we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive. changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components used in our products could affect our business. we purchase many parts and components from suppliers. the availability and prices of parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. some high-performance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications. in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change. we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. in connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. in addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy. some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and semiconductor markets. accordingly, any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter. the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business. our intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets, and a write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization. our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2005, goodwill totaled approximately $1.35 billion compared to approximately $1.25 billion of stockholders equity, which was approximately 54% of our total assets of approximately $2.52 billion. the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations become more conservative, we could incur, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. we depend on our abilities to develop new products. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins. this product development may require substantial investment by us. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. because many of our products rely on proprietary technology, we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our business. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the u.s. current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. any business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters couldadversely impact our financial performance. if terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the u.s. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions in the u.s. and abroad to deteriorate or cause world-wide demand for u.s. products to decline. a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the u.s. or in other areas of the world could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations and may result in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at december 31, 2005, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. our $1.055 billion senior credit facility contains $655 million variable rate term notes and a $400 million variable rate revolver. to reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, in 2005 the company entered into a $250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring march 13, 2008. our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate. at december 31, 2005, the prevailing market rates were between 0.75% and 1.75% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. at december 31, 2005, roper outstanding variable-rate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the $1.055 billion credit facility were $406.9 million. an increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $4.1 million. several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds, danish krone or japanese yen. sales by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 25% of our total sales and 66% of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency. the u.s. dollar strengthened against european and asian currencies during 2005 and weakened against the canadian dollar. the difference between 2005 operating results for these companies translated into u.s. dollars during 2005 and these operating results translated into u.s. dollars during 2005 was not material. if these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2005 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $2.5 million. the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar during 2005 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31, 2004 resulted in a decrease in net assets of $27.9 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $21.8 million of which was attributed to goodwill. goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. the trading price of roper common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. the stock prices also influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.risk factors risks relating to our business our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. as of december 31, 2006, we had approximately $1.0 billion in total consolidated indebtedness. in addition, we had approximately $144 million undrawn availability under our senior secured

our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency. we face intense competition. if we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. we face intense competition from numerous competitors. our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities with existing customers. we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. in addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner. we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive. changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components used in our products could affect our business. we purchase many parts and components from suppliers. the availability and prices of parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. some high-performance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications. in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change. we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. in connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. in addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy. some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and semiconductor markets. accordingly, any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter. the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business. our intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets, and a write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization. our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2006, goodwill totaled approximately $1.65 billion compared to approximately $1.49 billion of stockholders equity, which was approximately 55% of our total assets of approximately $3.00 billion. the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations become more conservative, we could incur, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. we depend on our abilities to develop new products. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins. this product development may require substantial investment by us. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. because many of our products rely on proprietary technology, we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our business. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the u.s. current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. any business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance. if terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the u.s. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions in the u.s. and abroad to deteriorate or cause world-wide demand for u.s. products to decline. a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the u.s. or in other areas of the world could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations and may result in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at december 31, 2006, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. our $1.055 billion senior credit facility contains $655 million variable rate term notes and a $400 million variable rate revolver. to reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, in 2005 the company entered into a $250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring march 13, 2008. at december 31, 2006, the interest rate on the variable portion of the term loans was 6.11% and 4.54% on the portion of the term loans covered by the rate swap. the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding revolver balance was 6.33% at december 31, 2006. our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. at december 31, 2006, the prevailing market rates were between 1.6% and 2.4% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. at december 31, 2006, roper outstanding variable-rate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the $1.055 billion credit facility were $540.8 million. an increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.4 million. several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds, danish krone or japanese yen. sales by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 29% of our total sales and 66% of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency. the u.s. dollar weakened against most currencies during 2006, with the exception of the japanese yen, which weakened slightly against the u.s. dollar. however, the average rates for 2006 and 2005 are very similar, therefore, the difference between 2006 operating results for these companies translated into u.s. dollars during 2006 and these operating results translated into u.s. dollars during 2005 was only 1%. if these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2006 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $4.2 million. the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar during 2006 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31, 2005 resulted in an increase in net assets of $23.6 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $20.7 million of which was attributed to goodwill. goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. the trading price of roper common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. the stock prices also influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.risk factors 8 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 3 2risk factors 7 risk factors risks relating to our business our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. as of december 31, 2010, we had $1.34 billion in total consolidated indebtedness. in addition, we had $468 million undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility, as well as the ability to request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments not to exceed $350 million in aggregate. our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity. subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or which is assumed in connection with, acquisitions. our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. for example, our indebtedness could: place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; limit our ability to complete future acquisitions; limit our ability to pay dividends; limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. in addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. if we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness. unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business. several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds and danish krone. sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar represented approximately 25% of our total net sales for the year ended december 31, 2010 compared to 23% for the year ended december 31, 2009. unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings. at present, we do not hedge against foreign currency risks. we export a significant portion of our products. difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business. sales to customers outside the u.s. by our businesses located in the u.s. account for a significant portion of our net sales. these sales accounted for approximately 15% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2010 and december 31, 2009. we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets. such risks include, without limitation, the following: unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export requirements; restrictions on the export of technology and related products; unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries; unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and a general economic downturn in our foreign markets. the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings. economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business. as of and for the year ended december 31, 2010, approximately 26% of our net sales and 18% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the u.s. we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the u.s. including, without limitation, the following: adverse changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets; trade protection measures and import or export requirements; subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations; partial or total expropriation; potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business. our growth strategy includes acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully. our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. there are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability. acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. product liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results. our business exposes us to product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacturing and distribution of our products. in addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. we currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. we also maintain other insurance policies, including directors' and officers' liability insurance. our insurance costs increased in prior periods and may continue to increase in the future. we believe that we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. however, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results. our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers. in some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows. additionally, many of our customers are government entities. in many situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency. we face intense

6.25%, and our $91 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. our $500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6.625%; however, in october 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling $500 million that expire august 2013. the swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, effectively convert the notes to a weighted average variable rate obligation with a spread of 4.377% plus libor. at decem ber 31, 2010, the prevailing market rates for our long term notes were between 1.5% and 4.1% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. at december 31, 2010, our outstanding variable-rate borrowings were $230 million in revolver borrowings and the $500 million senior notes due 2013. an increase in interest rates

all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. in addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner. we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive. changes in the supply of, or price for, raw materials, parts and components used in our products could affect our business. the availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. some high-performance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications. in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change. we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. in connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. in addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy. some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and energy markets. accordingly, any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business. our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets, and a write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization. our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $2.87 billion compared to $3.20 billion of stockholders' equity, and represented 54% of our total assets of $5.32 billion. the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating earnings. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. we depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins. this product development may require substantial internal investment. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our business. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. any business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance. if terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the u.s. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline. a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 25 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at december 31, 2011, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. our credit facility contains a $750 million variable rate revolver; however, there were no outstanding revolver borrowings at december 31, 2011. our $500 million senior notes due 2019 have a fixed interest rate of 6.25%, and our $67 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. our $500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6.625%; however, in october 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling $500 million that expire august 2013. the swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, effectively convert the notes to a weighted average variable rate obligation with a spread of 4.377% plus libor. at december 31, 2011, the prevailing market rates for our long term notes were between 2.5% and 5.1% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. at december 31, 2011, our outstanding variable-rate borrowing was the $500 million senior notes due 2013. an increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.0 million. several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish krone. sales by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 27% of our total sales and 63% of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency. the u.s. dollar was weaker against most currencies throughout most of 2011 as compared to 2010, which resulted in an increase in sales of 1.4% due to foreign currency exchange. if these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2011 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 2.7%. the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar at december 31, 2011 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31, 2010 resulted in a decrease in net assets of $11.0 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $5.1 million of which was attributed to goodwill. goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. the stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.risk factors 8 risk factors risks relating to our business our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. as of december 31, 2012, we had $2.02 billion in total consolidated indebtedness. in addition, we had $1.4 billion undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility, as well as the ability to request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments under our credit facility not to exceed $350 million in aggregate. our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity. subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. for example, our indebtedness could: place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; limit our ability to complete future acquisitions; limit our ability to pay dividends; limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. in addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. if we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness. unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business. several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish krone. sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar represented 25% of our total net sales for the year ended december 31, 2012 compared to 27% for the year ended december 31, 2011. unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings. we export a significant portion of our products. difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business. sales to customers outside the u.s. by our businesses located in the u.s. account for a significant portion of our net sales. these sales accounted for 15% of our net sales for each of the years ended december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011. we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets. such risks include, without limitation, the following: unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export requirements; restrictions on the export of technology and related products; unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries; unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and a general economic downturn in our foreign markets. the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings. economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business. as of and for the year ended december 31, 2012, 27% of our net sales and 22% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the u.s. we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the u.s. including, without limitation, the following: adverse changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets; trade protection measures and import or export requirements; subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations; partial or total expropriation; potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business. our growth strategy includes acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully. our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. there are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability. acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. product liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results. our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design, manufacturing and distribution of our products. in addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. we currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. we also maintain other insurance policies, including directors' and officers' liability insurance. our insurance costs increased in prior periods and may increase in the future. we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. however, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results. our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers. in some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows. additionally, many of our customers are government entities. in many situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency. we face intense competition. if we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. we face intense competition from numerous competitors. our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility and established customer

in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change. we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. in connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. in addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy. some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and energy markets. accordingly, a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business. our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets, and a write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization. our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2013, goodwill totaled $4.55 billion compared to $4.21 billion of stockholders' equity, and represented 56% of our total assets of $8.18 billion. the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating earnings. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. we depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins. this product development may require substantial internal investment. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations. our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors. a shutdown of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions. any business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance. if terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the u.s. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline. a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at december 31, 2013, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. our credit facility contains a $1.5 billion variable-rate revolver with outstanding borrowings of $250 million at december 31, 2013. our $400 million senior notes due 2017, $800 million senior notes due 2018, $500 million senior notes due 2019 and $500 million senior notes due 2022 have fixed interest rates of 1.850%, 2.050%, 3.125% and 6.250%, respectively, and our $8 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. at december 31, 2013, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 1.5% higher and 1.6% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. at december 31, 2013, our outstanding variable-rate borrowings were $250 million of outstanding revolver borrowings; an increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $2.5 million. several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish krone. sales by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 24% of our total sales in 2013 and 61% of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency. the u.s. dollar was stronger against most of our non-u.s. subsidiary currencies throughout most of 2013 as compared to 2012, which resulted in a decrease in sales of less than 1.0% due to foreign currency exchange. if these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2013 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 2.1%. the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar at december 31, 2013 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31, 2012 resulted in a pre-tax decrease in net assets of $17.9 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $9.5 million of which was attributed to goodwill. goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. the stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.risk factors 7 risk factors risks relating to our business our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. as of december 31, 2014, we had $2.21 billion in total consolidated indebtedness. in addition, we had $1.5 billion undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility, as well as the ability to request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments under our credit facility not to exceed $350 million in aggregate. our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity. subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. for example, our indebtedness could: place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; limit our ability to complete future acquisitions; limit our ability to pay dividends; limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. in addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. if we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness. 7 unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business. several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish kroner. sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar represented 23% of our total net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 24% for the year ended december 31, 2013. unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings. we export a significant portion of our products. difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business. sales to customers outside the u.s. by our businesses located in the u.s. account for a significant portion of our net sales. these sales accounted for 13% and 15% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets. such risks include, without limitation, the following: unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export requirements; restrictions on the export of technology and related products; unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries, including russia; unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and a general economic downturn in our foreign markets. the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings. economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business. as of and for the year ended december 31, 2014, 25% of our net sales and 19% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the u.s. we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the u.s. including, without limitation, the following: adverse changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in russia and emerging markets; oil price shocks; trade protection measures and import or export requirements; subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations; partial or total expropriation; potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business. our growth strategy includes acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully. our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. there are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability. acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 8 product liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results. our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design, manufacturing and distribution of our products. in addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. we currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. we also maintain other insurance policies, including directors' and officers' liability insurance. we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. however, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results. our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers. in some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows. additionally, many of our customers are government entities. in many situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency. in july 2014, puerto rico passed the public corporation debt enforcement and recovery act which may impact the future prospects of our customer, the puerto rico highways &amp; transportation authority. at the present time, we believe that existing contracts and payable obligations will be honored. we face intense competition. if we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. we face intense competition from numerous competitors. our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities. we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. in addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner. we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive. changes in the supply of, or price for, raw materials, parts and components used in our products could affect our business. the availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. some high-performance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications. in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price

other things, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. some high-performance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications. in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change. 10 we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. in connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. in addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy. some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and energy markets. accordingly, a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business. our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets, and a write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization. our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2015, goodwill totaled $5.8 billion compared to $5.3 billion of stockholders' equity, and represented 57% of our total assets of $10.2 billion. the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating earnings. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. we depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins. this product development may require substantial internal investment. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. 11 we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations. our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors. a shutdown of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions. any business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance. if terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the u.s. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline. a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at december 31, 2015, we had $3.1 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 1.85% to 6.25%. at december 31, 2015, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 1.4% higher and 2.4% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. our credit facility contains a $1.85 billion variable-rate revolver with $180 million of outstanding borrowings at december 31, 2015. several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated i n euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish kroner. sales by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 20% of our total sales in 2015 an d 61% o f these sales were by companies with a european functional currency. if these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2015 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1.6%. the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. the stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable. 26risk factors 8 risk factors risks relating to our business our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. as of december 31, 2016, we had $6.2 billion in total consolidated indebtedness. in addition, we had $535 million undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility. subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. for example, our indebtedness could: place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; limit our ability to complete future acquisitions; limit our ability to pay dividends; limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. in addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. if we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. 8 our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness. unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business. several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish kroner. sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar represented 20% of our total net sales for each of the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings. we export a significant portion of our products. difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business. sales to customers outside the u.s. by our businesses located in the u.s. account for a significant portion of our net sales. these sales accounted for 12% of our net sales for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 13% for the year ended december 31, 2015. we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets. such risks include, without limitation, the following: unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export requirements; restrictions on the export of technology and related products; unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries; unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and a general economic downturn in our foreign markets. the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings. economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business. as of and for the year ended december 31, 2016, 21% of our net sales and 13% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the u.s. we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the u.s. including, without limitation, the following: adverse changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets; oil price shocks; trade protection measures and import or export requirements; subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations; partial or total expropriation; potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business. 9 our growth strategy includes acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully. our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. there are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability. acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. product liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results. our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design, manufacturing and distribution of our products. in addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. we currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses. we also maintain other insurance policies, including directors' and officers' liability insurance. we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. however, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results. our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers. in some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows. additionally, many of our customers are government entities. in many situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency. we face intense competition. if we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. we face intense competition from numerous competitors. our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility, distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities. we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. in addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner. we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive. changes in the supply of, or price for, raw materials, parts and components used in our products could affect our business. the availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. some high-performance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications. in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 10 environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change. we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. in connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. in addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy. some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and energy markets. accordingly, a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business. our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets, and a write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization. our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2016, goodwill totaled $8.6 billion compared to $5.8 billion of stockholders' equity, and represented 60% of our total assets of $14.3 billion. the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating earnings. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. we depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins. this product development may require substantial internal investment. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 11 our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. we rely on

networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors. a shutdown of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions. with the types of licensing vehicles we use to deliver our products to market, including subscription and on-demand pricing for our software and services, the recognition of revenue for the products and services we sell could be delayed from one period to another. as we continue to vary the ways in which we deliver our products to the market, including expanded use of subscription, term and saas offerings, we may be required under existing accounting rules to defer the recognition of revenue from one period to another. the deferral of perpetual licenses revenue may result in significant timing differences between the completion of a sale and the actual recognition of the revenue related to that sale. as a result, the revenue we recognize in a particular period may not be reflective of our actual success in selling our products and solutions in the market. offering our products on a saas basis presents execution risks. we offer a number of our products in a saas-based environment, and we expect to expand those offerings in the future. as more of our solutions are delivered as saas-based solutions, it is uncertain whether our strategies will generate the revenue required to be successful. any significant costs we incur may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas, including ensuring that our saas-based offerings meet the performance, reliability and cost expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data. if we are unable to execute on this strategy, our revenue or financial results may be materially adversely affected. a breach in the security of our software could harm our reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers, and subject us to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. if our security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users' or customers' data. in addition, cyber-attacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of a customer's data. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer, and operate in more countries. regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states, europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 12 any security breaches for which we are, or are perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm our reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. security breaches also could cause us to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business. moreover, we might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to protect further against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach. any business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance. if terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the u.s. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline. a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 29 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at december 31, 2016, we had $4.3 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 1.85% to 6.25%. at december 31, 2016, the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 0.9% higher and 2.9% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. our credit facility contains a $2.5 billion variable-rate revolver with $1.93 billion of outstanding borrowings at december 31, 2016. several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated i n euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish kroner. sales by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 20% of our total sales in 2016 an d 61% o f these sales were by companies with a european functional currency. if these

determinable. 29risk factors 8 risk factors risks relating to our business our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. as of december 31, 2017 , we had $5.2 billion in total consolidated indebtedness. in addition, we had $1.2 billion undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility. subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. for example, our indebtedness could: limit our ability to borrow additional funds; limit our ability to complete future acquisitions; limit our ability to pay dividends; limit our ability to make capital expenditures; place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. in addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. if we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness. unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business. several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish kroner. sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar represented 17% and 20% of our total net revenues for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported revenues and earnings. 8 we export a significant portion of our products. difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business. sales to customers outside the u.s. by our businesses located in the u.s. account for a significant portion of our net revenues. these sales accounted for 11% of our net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 and 12% for the year ended december 31, 2016 . we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets. such risks include, without limitation, the following: unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export requirements; restrictions on the export of technology and related products; unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries; unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and a general economic downturn in our foreign markets. the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings. economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business. as of and for the year ended december 31, 2017 , 20% of our net revenues and 18% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the u.s. we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the u.s. including, without limitation, the following: adverse changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets; oil price volatility; trade protection measures and import or export requirements; subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations; partial or total expropriation; potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; and differing and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. our growth strategy includes acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully. our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. there are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability. acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 9 our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. product liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results. our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design, manufacturing and distribution of our products. in addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. we currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses. we also maintain other insurance policies, including directors' and officers' liability insurance. we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. however, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results. our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers. in some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could reduce our revenues and cash flows. additionally, many of our customers are government entities. in many situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency. we face intense competition. if we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. we face intense competition from numerous competitors. our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility, distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities. we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. in addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner. we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive. changes in the supply of, or price for, raw materials, parts and components used in our products could affect our business. the availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. some high-performance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications. in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could, in certain instances, require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change. we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in some of our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. in connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. in addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become 10 the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy. some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and energy markets. accordingly, a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business. our goodwill and intangible assets are a significant amount of our total assets, and any write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations. our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2017 , goodwill totaled $8.8 billion compared to $6.9 billion of stockholders' equity, and represented 62% of our total assets of $14.3 billion . the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating earnings. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations, the effect of which could be material. we depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that we maintain our margin profile. this product development may require substantial internal investment. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations. our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors. a shutdown of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. computer viruses, cyber-attacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to perform necessary business functions. a breach in the security of our software could harm our reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers, and subject us to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. if our security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users' or customers' data. in addition, cyber-attacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of customers' data. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer, and operate in more countries. regulatory authorities around the world have adopted and are considering further adoptions of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states, europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner 11 that is inconsistent with our data practices. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. any security breaches for which we are, or are perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm our reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. security breaches also could cause us to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business. moreover, we might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to protect further against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach. any business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance. if terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the u.s. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline. a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 27 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at december 31, 2017 , we had $3.9 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 2.05% to 6.25%. at december 31, 2017 , the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 0.05% higher and 3.85% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. our credit facility contains a $2.5 billion variable-rate revolver with $1.27 billion of outstanding borrowings at december 31, 2017 . several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish kroner. net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 17% of our total revenues in 2017 and 68% of these revenues were recognized by companies with a european functional currency. if these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2017 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1%. the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share. the stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable. 27risk factors 8 risk factors risks relating to our business our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. as of december 31, 2018 , we had $4.9 billion in total consolidated indebtedness. in addition, we had $1.6 billion undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility. subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. for example, our indebtedness could: limit our ability to borrow additional funds; limit our ability to complete future acquisitions; limit our ability to pay dividends; limit our ability to make capital expenditures; place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. in addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. if we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness. unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business. several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish kroner. sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar represented 17% of our total net revenues for both the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 . unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported revenues and earnings. 8 we export a significant portion of our products. difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business. sales to customers outside the u.s. by our businesses located in the u.s. account for a significant portion of our net revenues. these sales accounted for 11% of our net revenues for both the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 . we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets. such risks include, without limitation, the following: unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export requirements; restrictions on the export of technology and related products; unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries; unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and a general economic downturn in our foreign markets. the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings. economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business. as of and for the year ended december 31, 2018 , 20% of our net revenues and 17% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the u.s. we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the u.s. including, without limitation, the following: adverse changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets; oil price volatility; trade protection measures, tariffs, and import or export requirements; subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations; partial or total expropriation; potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; differing and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and potentially negative consequences from the united kingdom's exit from the european union. our growth strategy includes acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully. our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. there are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability. acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 9 our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. product liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results. our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design, manufacture and distribution of our products. in addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. we currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses. we also maintain other insurance policies, including directors' and officers' liability insurance. we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. however, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results. our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers. in some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could reduce our revenues and cash flows. additionally, many of our customers are government entities. in many situations, government entities can

particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. security breaches also could cause us to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business. moreover, we might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to protect further against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach. changes in the supply of, or price for, raw materials, parts and components used in our products could affect our business. the availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. some high-performance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications. in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. environmental compliance costs

hazardous substances and wastes in some of our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. in connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. in addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of

the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business. our goodwill and intangible assets are a significant amount of our total assets, and any write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations. our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2018 , goodwill totaled $9.3 billion compared to $7.7 billion of stockholders' equity, and represented 61% of our total assets of $15.2 billion . the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating income. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations, the effect of which could be material. 11 we depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that we maintain our margin profile. this product development may require substantial internal investment. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development,

have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. recent significant changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team, and the resulting management transitions, could harm our operating results. we have recently experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team. leadership transitions and changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key leadership positions. if we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and changes, it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 27 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at december 31, 2018 , we had $4.1 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 2.8% to 4.2%. at december 31, 2018 , the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 0.1% and 0.7% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. our credit facility contains a $2.5 billion variable-rate revolver with $865 of outstanding borrowings at december 31, 2018 . several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in

credit facility. subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. 8 our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. for example, our indebtedness could: limit our ability to borrow additional funds; limit our ability to complete future acquisitions; limit our ability to pay dividends; limit our ability to make capital expenditures; place us at a competitive

authority (fca) in the u.k. announced that it would phase out london interbank offered rate ( libor ) as a benchmark by the end of 2021. it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. if libor ceases to exist, we may need to amend certain agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties. as a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. in addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of libor. unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business. several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish kroner. sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar represented 16% and 17% of our total net revenues for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported revenues and earnings. we export a significant portion of our products. difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business. sales to customers outside the u.s. by our businesses located in the u.s. account for a significant portion of our net revenues. these sales accounted for 10% and 11% of our net revenues for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. we are subject to

changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export requirements; restrictions on the export of technology and related products; unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries; unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and a general economic downturn in our foreign markets. 9 the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings. economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business. as of and for the year ended december 31, 2019 , 19% of our net revenues and 17% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the u.s. we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the u.s. including, without limitation, the following: adverse changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets; oil price volatility; trade protection measures, tariffs, and import or export requirements; subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations; partial or total expropriation; potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; differing and

however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate

integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage. many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful. 10 product liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results. our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design, manufacture and distribution of our products. in addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. we currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses. we also maintain other insurance policies, including directors' and officers' liability insurance. we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. however, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results. our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers. in some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could reduce our revenues and cash flows. additionally, many of our customers are government entities. in many situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency. we face intense competition. if we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. we face intense competition from numerous competitors. our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility, distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities. we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. in addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner. we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive. we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations. our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors. a shutdown of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. computer viruses, cyber-attacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to perform necessary business functions. a breach in the security of our software could harm our reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers, and subject us to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. if our security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users' or customers' data. in addition, cyber-attacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of customers' data. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer, and operate in more countries. regulatory authorities around the world have adopted and are considering further adoption of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and data privacy. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states, europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 11 any security breaches for which we are, or are perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm our reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. security breaches also could cause us to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business. moreover, we might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to protect further against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach. changes in the supply of, or price for, raw materials, parts and components used in our products could affect our business. the availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could, in certain instances, require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. additionally, we could be affected by future regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change. we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change. we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in some of our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. in connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. in addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy. some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and energy markets. accordingly, a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on material portions of our business. our goodwill and intangible assets are a significant amount of our total assets, and any write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations. our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2019 , goodwill totaled $10.8 billion compared to $9.5 billion of stockholders' equity, and represented 60% of our total assets of $18.1 billion . the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating income. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations, the effect of which could be material. 12 we depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that we maintain our margin profile. this product development may require substantial internal investment. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. any business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, public health crisis or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance. if terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability, public health crisis, such as an epidemic or pandemic related to the coronavirus, or natural disasters occur in the u.s. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline. a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. recent significant changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team, and the resulting management transitions, could harm our operating results. over the past several years, we have experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team. leadership transitions and changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key leadership positions. if we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and changes, it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at december 31, 2019 , we had $5.3 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 2.35% to 4.20%. at december 31, 2019 , the prevailing market rates for our long-term notes were between 0.1% and 1.5% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. our credit facility contains a $2.5 billion variable-rate revolver with $0 of outstanding borrowings at december 31, 2019 . several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish kroner. net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 16% of our total revenues in 2019 and 70% of these revenues were recognized by companies with a european functional currency. if these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2019 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1%. the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share. the stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable. 26quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on its outstanding borrowings. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. at october 31, 2002, we had a combination of fixed-rate borrowings (primarily $125 million of term notes) and relatively variable-rate borrowings (primarily borrowings under the $275 million credit facility). although each borrowing under the $275 million credit facility has a fixed rate, the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only 1-3 months. at october 31, 2002, prevailing market interest rates were lower than the fixed rates on the term notes by 2-3 percentage points. this resulted in the estimated fair values of the term notes using a discounted cash flows model being greater than the face amounts of the notes by an estimated $15.6 million and it represented an unrecorded decrease in our net assets at october 31, 2002. there was a comparable unrecorded decrease in our net assets of $11.7 million at october 31, 2001. if interest rates had been 1% higher at october 31, 2002, the difference between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would have been approximately $7.1 million smaller. these interest rate differences do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. at october 31, 2002, roper's outstanding variable-rate borrowings under the $275 million credit facility were $186.4 million. an increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $1.9 million. several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, british pounds, danish krone or japanese yen. sales by companies whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar were 28% of our total sales and 80% of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency. the u.s. dollar weakened against these european currencies during fiscal 2002 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies. the difference between fiscal 2002's operating results for these companies translated into u.s. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2002 and these operating results translated into u.s. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2001 was not material. if these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout fiscal 2002 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $2 million. the changes of these currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar during fiscal 2002 compared to currency exchange rates at october 31, 2001 resulted in an increase in net assets of $13.7 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $10.9 million of which was attributed to goodwill. goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. 30 the trading price of roper's common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. the stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share. the stock price also affects our employees' perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.
