risk factors 11 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information called for by this item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs in the md&amp;a captioned market risk and value at risk on pages 42 to 43 of the 2008 annual report and made a part hereof.risk factors 9 risk factors. the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report. any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report. forward-looking and cautionary statements we may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the sec, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. you can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as strategy, expects, continues, plans, anticipates, believes, will, estimates, intends, projects, goals, targets and other words of similar meaning. you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in the business environment section preceding our discussion of operating results of our business. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations. risks related to our business and industry cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. these tax increases may affect our profitability disproportionately and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors. tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium price manufactured cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. as a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets. increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit. -9- table of contents the european commission is seeking to alter minimum retail selling price systems. several eu member states have enacted laws establishing a minimum retail selling price for cigarettes and, in some cases, other tobacco products. the european commission has commenced proceedings against these member states in the european court of justice, claiming that minimum retail selling price systems infringe eu law. the advocate general of the court of justice issued an advisory opinion related to the proceedings against austria, france and ireland, agreeing with the position of the european commission. if the european commission infringement actions are successful, they could adversely impact excise tax levels and/or price gaps in those markets. our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of preventing the use of tobacco products. governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such actions will continue to reduce consumption levels. significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the world health organization framework convention on tobacco control ( fctc ). the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. in addition, the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and appeal of tobacco products to adult smokers. regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include: the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and plain packaging; restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients; increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and encouraging litigation against tobacco companies. partly because of some or a combination of these measures, unit sales of tobacco products in certain markets, principally western europe and japan, have been in general decline and we expect this trend to continue. our operating income could be significantly affected by any significant decrease in demand for our products, any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements and requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products. litigation related to cigarette smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ( ets ) could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity. there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions. damages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in brazil, israel, nigeria and -10- table of contents canada, range into the billions of dollars. we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. it is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. please see item 3. legal proceedings of this form 10-k for a discussion of tobacco-related litigation. we face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and price. we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors introduction of low-price products or innovative products, higher cigarette taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, government-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in china, egypt, thailand, taiwan, vietnam and algeria. industry consolidation and privatizations of governmental enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates. because we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments in many countries. some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. in others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. economic, political, regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain or our distribution capabilities. in addition, such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings. in certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes. in addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees. we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns. our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. to be successful, we must: promote brand equity successfully; anticipate and respond to new consumer trends; develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios; improve productivity; and be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases. -11- table of contents in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may tend to purchase lower price brands, and the volume of our premium price, high-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly. we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases. large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the amount of revenues we lose as a result of this activity. in addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband and legal cross-border purchases. from time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of custom duties and/or excise taxes, and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as lights and ultra lights. we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations. see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-operating results by business segment-business environment-governmental investigations for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject. we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce cigarettes with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases. we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking. our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and meet adult smokers taste expectations. we may not succeed in these efforts. if we do not succeed, but one or more of our competitors do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. further, we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers, which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products. our reported results could be adversely affected by currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness. we conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer u.s. dollars. during periods of local economic crises, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the u.s. dollar, reducing our margins. actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position. the repatriation of our foreign earnings, changes in the earnings mix, and changes in u.s. tax laws may increase our effective tax rate. because we are a u.s. holding company, our most significant source of funds will be distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. under current u.s. tax law, in general we do not pay u.s. taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the u.s. as distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. these distributions may result in a residual u.s. tax cost. it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions, which could result in a -12- table of contents material increase in our overall effective tax rate. additionally, the obama administration has indicated that it favors changes in u.s. tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the u.s. if enacted and depending upon its precise terms, such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate. our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix. our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies. we may be unable to expand our portfolio through successful acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings. government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products. as with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns. tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco. any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business. our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking. the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance. as a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent. we could incur significant indemnity obligations if our action or failure to act causes the spin-off to be taxable. under the tax sharing agreement between altria and us, we have agreed to indemnify altria and its affiliates if we take, or fail to take, any action where such action, or failure to act, precludes the spin-off from qualifying as a tax-free transaction. for a discussion of these restrictions, please see the distribution-u.s. federal income tax consequences of the distribution, which is included in our registration statement on form 10. your percentage ownership of our common shares may be diluted by future acquisitions. to the extent we issue new shares of common stock to fund acquisitions, your percentage ownership of our shares will be diluted. there is no assurance that the effect of this dilution will be offset by accretive earnings from the acquisition. -13- table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information called

substantial taxes. significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. these tax increases may affect our profitability disproportionately and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors. tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price manufactured cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. as a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets. increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit. -10- table of contents the elimination of minimum retail selling price systems in the european union may adversely affect our business. during the first half of 2010, the european court of justice ruled against several eu member states (austria, france, ireland and italy) that had enacted laws establishing a minimum retail selling price for cigarettes and, in some cases, other tobacco products on the grounds that such systems infringe on eu law. as a result, austria and france have abolished their minimum retail selling price systems. these developments could adversely impact excise tax levels and widen price gaps in those markets, which may adversely affect our business. our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements

state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in algeria, egypt, the prc, taiwan, thailand and vietnam. industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates. because we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments in many countries. some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. in others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. economic, political, regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain or our distribution capabilities. in addition, such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings. in certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes. in addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners. we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns. our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. to be successful, we must: promote brand equity successfully; anticipate and respond to new consumer trends; develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios; improve productivity; and be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases. in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may tend to purchase lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly. we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases. large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. in addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband and legal cross-border purchases. -11- table of contents from time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of customs duties and/or excise taxes, and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as lights and ultra lights. we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations. see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating results by business segment business environment governmental investigations for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject. we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce products with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases. we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking. our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and meet adult smokers taste expectations. we may not succeed in these efforts. if we do not succeed, but others do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. furthermore, we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers, which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products. our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness. we conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer u.s. dollars. during periods of local economic crises, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the u.s. dollar, reducing our margins. actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position. the repatriation of our foreign earnings, changes in the earnings mix, and changes in u.s. tax laws may increase our effective tax rate. because we are a u.s. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. under current u.s. tax law, in general we do not pay u.s. taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the u.s. as distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. these distributions may result in a residual u.s. tax cost. it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions, which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate. additionally, the obama administration has indicated that it favors changes in u.s. tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the u.s. if enacted and depending upon its precise terms, such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate. our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix. our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies. -12- table of contents we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings. government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impacts of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products. as with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco. any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business. our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking. the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance. as a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent. the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption, loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data. we use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others. some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could result in loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us. -13- table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 27 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information

factors. consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations. - 7 - table of contents risks related to our business and industry cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors. tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price manufactured cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. as a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets. increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and illicit whites. our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products. governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases. significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the world health organization's framework convention on tobacco control ( fctc ). the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation. the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers. regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include: restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes; the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and plain packaging; restrictions on packaging and cigarette formats and dimensions; restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents; disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients; increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers; and encouraging litigation against tobacco companies. our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands, in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements. litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ( ets ) could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity. there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions. damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in brazil, canada, israel and nigeria, range into the billions of - 8 - table of contents u.s. dollars. we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. it is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. see item 3. legal proceedings of this form 10-k. we face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and price. we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in algeria, china, egypt, taiwan, thailand and vietnam. industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. because we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments or natural disasters in many countries. some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. in others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. economic, political, regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or our distribution capabilities. in addition, such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings. in certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes. in addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and

lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly. such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits

conventional cigarettes. we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases. our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and provide adult smokers the taste, sensory experience and smoking ritual characteristics that are as close as possible to those currently provided by conventional cigarettes. we may not succeed in these efforts. if we do not succeed, but others do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. furthermore, we cannot predict whether regulators will

limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to make payments outside the country. our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix. our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise

country. our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix. our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies. - 10 - table of contents we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships. one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings. government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products. as with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco. any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business. our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking. the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance. as a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent. the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption, loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data. we use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others. some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could result in loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us. we may be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources. in certain instances, we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services. we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations. accordingly, our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 23 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information called for by this item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs in the md&amp;a captioned market risk on pages 34 to 35 of the 2013 annual report and made a part hereof.risk factors 7 risk factors. the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k. any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report on form 10-k. forward-looking and cautionary statements we may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k and other filings with the sec, in

all risk factors. consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations. 7 risks related to our business and industry cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors. tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price manufactured cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. as a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets. increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and "illicit whites." our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products. governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase down-trading and the risk of counterfeiting, contraband, "illicit whites" and legal cross-border purchases. significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the world health organization's framework convention on tobacco control ( fctc ). the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation. the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers. regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include: restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes; the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and plain packaging; restrictions on packaging and cigarette formats and dimensions; restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents; disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients; increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers; and encouraging litigation against tobacco companies. our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands, in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements. litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity. there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions. damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in brazil, canada and nigeria, range into the billions of u.s. dollars. we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. it is possible that our consolidated results 8 of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. see item 3. legal proceedings ("item 3") and item 8, note 21. contingencies for a discussion of pending litigation. we face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and price. we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in algeria, china, egypt, taiwan, thailand and vietnam. industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. because we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters or conflicts. some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. in others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. economic, political, regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or our distribution capabilities. in addition, such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings. there is an increasing number of conflicts, including in the middle east and ukraine. political uncertainty, including potential effects from current or future economic sanctions by the u.s. or other governments, could lead to significant disruptions to our business. in certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes, and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth in our profitability. in addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners. we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns. our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. to be successful, we must: promote brand equity successfully; anticipate and respond to new consumer trends; develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios; improve productivity; and be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases. in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may tend to purchase lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly. such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases and non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers. large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. in addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband, legal cross-border purchases and non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers. 9 from time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of customs duties and/or excise taxes, allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising. we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations. see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-operating results by business segment-business environment-governmental investigations for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject. we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce reduced-risk products, and regulators may not permit reduced exposure or risk claims. we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies with the potential to reduce exposure to harmful constituents in smoke and individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes. our goal is to develop products whose potential to reduce exposure, individual risk and population harm can be substantiated by rigorous scientific studies and that provide adult smokers the taste, sensory experience, nicotine delivery profile and ritual characteristics that are similar to those currently provided by combustible cigarettes. we may not succeed in these efforts. if we do not succeed, but others do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. furthermore, we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products or other nicotine-containing products with claims of reduced exposure or disease risk. a prohibition on any such claims could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products. our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness. we conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer u.s. dollars. during periods of local economic crises, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the u.s. dollar, reducing our margins. actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position. the repatriation of our foreign earnings, changes in the earnings mix, and changes in u.s. tax laws may increase our effective tax rate. our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls. because we are a u.s. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. under current u.s. tax law, in general we do not pay u.s. taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the u.s. as distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. these distributions may result in a residual u.s. tax cost. it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions, which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate. additionally, the obama administration has indicated that it favors changes in u.s. tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the u.s. if enacted and depending upon its precise terms, such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate. certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to make payments outside the country. our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix. our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies. we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships. one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings. 10 government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products. as with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. changes in

industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance. as a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent. the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data. we use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others. some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could result in loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us. we may be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources. in certain instances, we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services. we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations. accordingly, our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources. quantitative

of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets. this decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and the continuing prevalence of illicit products. these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7, business environment . cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors. tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail

payments outside the country. this could subject us to the risk of local currency devaluation. our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix. our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies. 10 we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships. one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings. government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate

penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data. we use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others. some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from

with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services. we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations. accordingly, our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 80 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information called for by this item is included in item 7, market risk . 80risk factors 6 risk factors. the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k. any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report on form 10-k. forward-looking and cautionary statements we may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k and other filings with the sec, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. you can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "continues," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will," "estimates," "intends," "projects," "goals," "targets" and other words of similar meaning. you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in item 7, business environment . you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations. 6 risks related to our business and industry consumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets. this decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and the continuing prevalence of illicit products. these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7, business environment . cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors. tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. as a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets. increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and "illicit whites." our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products. governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase down-trading and the risk of counterfeiting, contraband, "illicit whites" and legal cross-border purchases. significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the world health organization's framework convention on tobacco control ( fctc ). the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation. the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers. regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include: restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes; the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and plain packaging; restrictions on packaging and cigarette formats and dimensions; restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents; disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients; increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; restrictions on the sale of novel tobacco or nicotine-containing products; elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers; and encouraging litigation against tobacco companies. our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands, in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements. 7 litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity. there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions. damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in brazil, canada and nigeria, range into the billions of u.s. dollars. we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. it is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. see item 3. legal proceedings and item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 19. contingencies for a discussion of pending litigation. we face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and price. we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in algeria, the prc, egypt, taiwan, thailand and vietnam. industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. because we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters or conflicts. some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. in others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. economic, political, regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities. in addition, such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings. in certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes, and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth in our profitability. in addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners. we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns. our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. to be successful, we must: promote brand equity successfully; anticipate and respond to new consumer trends; develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios; improve productivity; ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases. in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may tend to purchase lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly. such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. 8 we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases and non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers. large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. in addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband, legal cross-border purchases and non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers. from time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of customs duties and/or excise taxes, allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising. we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations. see item 3, legal proceedings-other litigation and item 7, business environment-governmental investigations for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject. we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to introduce reduced-risk products, and regulators may not permit the commercialization of these products or health-related claims. our key strategic priorities are: to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those rrps. for our efforts to be successful, we must: develop rrps that such adult smokers find acceptable alternatives to smoking; conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate that they reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and, ultimately, that these products present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking; and effectively advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps, including communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult consumers to make better health choices. we might not succeed in our efforts. if we do not succeed, but others do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. furthermore, we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale and/or marketing of rrps with health-related claims. such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps. our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness. we conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer u.s. dollars. during periods of local economic crises, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the u.s. dollar, reducing our margins. actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position. the repatriation of our foreign earnings, changes in the earnings mix, and changes in tax laws may increase our effective tax rate. our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls. because we are a u.s. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. under current u.s. tax law, in general we do not pay u.s. taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the u.s. as distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. these distributions may result in a residual u.s. tax cost. it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions, which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate under current u.s. tax law. furthermore, our effective tax rate could be increased due to changes in the earnings mix or applicable tax laws. in addition, certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to convert local currency into u.s. dollars or to make payments outside the country. this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption. our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix. our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies. 9 we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships. one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings. government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products. as with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco. any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business. our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking. the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance. as a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent. the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data. we use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others. some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in a loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us. we may be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources. in certain instances, we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services. we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations. accordingly, our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 77 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.

differentiate reduced-risk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation. to date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our rrps are not cigarettes, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. if we cease to be successful in these efforts, rrp unit margins may be adversely affected. 9 our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness. we conduct our

repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls. the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the u.s. tax system. our estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act is based on management's current interpretations, and our analysis is ongoing. our final tax liability may be materially different from current estimates due to developments such as implementing regulations and clarifications. in future periods, our effective tax rate and our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments. furthermore, changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. because we are a u.s. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to convert local currency into u.s. dollars or to make payments outside the country. this could subject us

and respect the rights of data subjects could subject us to substantial fines under regulations such as the eu general data protection regulation. we may be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources. in certain instances, we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services. we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations. accordingly, our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third

business. achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to

individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in item 7, business environment . you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion 5 of all potential risks or uncertainties. we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations. risks related to our business and industry consumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets. this decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and the continuing prevalence of illicit products. these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7, business environment . cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors. tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. as a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets. increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and "illicit whites." our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products. governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase down-trading and the risk of counterfeiting, contraband, "illicit whites" and legal cross-border purchases. significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the world health organization's framework convention on tobacco control ( fctc ). since it came into force in 2005, the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers. regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include: restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes; the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and plain packaging; restrictions on packaging and cigarette formats and dimensions; restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents; disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients; increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; regulation, restrictions or prohibitions of novel tobacco or nicotine-containing products; elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers; encouraging litigation against tobacco companies; and excluding tobacco companies from transparent public dialogue regarding public health and other policy matters. 6 our financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands, in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers' ability to convert to our rrps, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements. litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity. there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions. damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in brazil, canada, israel and nigeria, range into the billions of u.s. dollars. we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. it is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. see item 8, note 18. contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pending litigation and item 7, business environment reduced-risk products (rrps) legal challenges to rrps. we face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, r&amp;d, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps. we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our rrps. competitors include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in algeria, egypt, the prc, taiwan, thailand and vietnam. industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. certain new market entrants may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns and messaging and inferior product satisfaction, while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate r&amp;d protocols and standards. the growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our rrps. because we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters, pandemics or conflicts. some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. in others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. natural disasters, pandemics, economic, political, regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities. in addition, such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings. in certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes, and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth of our profitability. in addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and partners. 7 we may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences. our business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. to be successful, we must: promote brand equity successfully; anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends; develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios; improve productivity; convince adult smokers to convert to our rrps; ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases. in periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly. such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. the financial and business performance of our reduced-risk products is less predictable than our cigarette business. our rrps are novel products in a new category, and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary, depending on the competitive, regulatory, fiscal and cultural environment, and other factors in a specific market. there may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products, the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business. the impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant, particularly during the early stages of this new product category. we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases, illicit whites, non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers, and counterfeiting of our iqos device and heated tobacco units. large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. in addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband, legal cross-border purchases, illicit whites and non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers. our revenues and consumer satisfaction with our iqos device and heated tobacco units may be adversely affected by counterfeit products that do not meet our product quality standards and scientific validation procedures. from time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of customs duties and/or excise taxes, allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising. we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations. see item, 8, note 18. contingencies other litigation and item 7, business environment governmental investigations for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject. 8 we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to introduce reduced-risk products, and regulators may not permit the commercialization of these products or the communication of scientifically substantiated risk-reduction claims. our key strategic priorities are: to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those rrps. for our efforts to be successful, we must: develop rrps that such adult smokers find acceptable alternatives to smoking; conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate that they reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and, ultimately, that these products present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking; and effectively advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps, including communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices. we might not succeed in our efforts. if we do not succeed, but others do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. furthermore, we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale and/or marketing of rrps with scientifically substantiated risk-reduction claims. such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps. we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reduced-risk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation. to date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our rrps are not cigarettes, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. if we cease to be successful in these efforts, rrp unit margins may be adversely affected. our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness. we conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported net revenues, operating income and eps will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer u.s. dollars. during periods of local economic crises, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the u.s. dollar, reducing our margins. actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position. changes in the earnings mix and changes in tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls. the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the u.s. tax system. our estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act is based on management's current interpretations, and our analysis is ongoing. our final tax liability may be materially different from current estimates due to developments such as implementing regulations and clarifications. in future periods, our effective tax rate and our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments. furthermore, changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. because we are a u.s. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to convert local currency into u.s. dollars or to make payments outside the country. this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption. our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix. our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies. we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships. one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings. 9 government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products. as with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves. any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business. our ability to achieve our strategic goals may be impaired if we fail to attract and retain the best global talent. to be successful, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent with our business needs, innovate and transform to a consumer-centric business. we compete for talent, including in areas that are new to us, such as digital and technical solutions, with companies in the consumer products, technology and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance. as a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, experience and skills to achieve our strategic goals. the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them or our failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations could result in business disruption, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other confidential data. we use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, consumers, customers and others. some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in a loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs. failure to protect personal data, respect the rights of data subjects, and adhere to strict cybersecurity protocols could subject us to substantial fines and other legal challenges under regulations such as the eu general data protection regulation. as we are increasingly relying on digital platforms in our business, the magnitude of these risks is likely to increase. we may be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources. in certain instances, we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services. we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations. accordingly, our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 56 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information called for by this item is included in item 7, market risk .

efforts. if we do not succeed, but others do, or if heat-not-burn products are inequitably regulated compared to other rrp categories without regard to the totality of the scientific evidence available for such products, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, actions of some market entrants, such as the inappropriate marketing of e-vapor products to youth, as well as alleged health consequences associated with the use of certain e-vapor products, may unfavorably impact public opinion and/or mischaracterize all e-vapor products or other rrps to consumers, regulators and policy makers 8 without regard to the totality of scientific evidence for specific products. this may impede our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps. we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale and/or marketing of rrps with scientifically substantiated risk-reduction claims. such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps. moreover, the fda's premarket tobacco product authorization of a version of our platform 1 product is subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements and is not a guarantee that the product will remain authorized, particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth initiation. we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reduced-risk

estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act is based on management's current interpretations, and our analysis is ongoing. our final tax liability may be materially different from current estimates due to developments such as implementing regulations and clarifications. in future periods, our effective tax rate and our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments. furthermore, changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. because we are a u.s. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to convert local currency into u.s. dollars or to make payments outside the country. this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption. our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix. our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies. we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships. one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings. government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products. as with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. changes in the 9 patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves. any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business. our ability to achieve our strategic goals may be impaired if we fail to attract and retain the best global talent. to be successful, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent with our business needs, innovate and transform to a consumer-centric business. we compete for talent, including in areas that are new to us, such as digital and technical solutions, with companies in the consumer products, technology and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance. as a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, experience and skills to achieve our strategic goals. the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them or our failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations could result in business disruption, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other confidential data. we use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, consumers, customers and others. some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in a loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs. failure to protect personal data, respect the rights of data subjects, and adhere to strict cybersecurity protocols could subject us to substantial fines and other legal challenges under regulations such as the eu general data protection regulation. as we are increasingly relying on digital platforms in our business, the magnitude of these risks is likely to increase. we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and disputes relating to intellectual property rights could harm our business. our intellectual property rights are valuable assets, and their protection is important to our business. if the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights globally, including through a combination of trademark, design, patent and other intellectual property rights, are inadequate, or if others infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights, notwithstanding legal protection, our business could suffer. intellectual property rights of third parties may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products in one or more markets. competitors or other third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights. any such claims, regardless of merit, could divert management's attention, be costly, disruptive, time-consuming and unpredictable and expose us to litigation costs and damages, and impede our ability to manufacture and sell new products or improve existing products. if, as a result, we are unable to manufacture or sell our rrps or improve their quality in one or more markets, our ability to convert adult smokers to our rrps in such markets would be adversely affected. we may be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources. in certain instances, we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services. we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations. accordingly, our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information called for by this
