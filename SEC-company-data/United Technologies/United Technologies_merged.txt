consolidated financial statements on pages 21 and 29 through 30 of the corporation's 2002 annual report to shareowners.risk factors 12 risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. our global growth may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions. our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices, exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy. these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. similarly, this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 47 percent of our consolidated sales in 2013, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, global credit market conditions, and other global and political factors. for example, a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate, controls &amp; security. in addition, the financial performance of utc climate, controls &amp; security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business, weather conditions. the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 53 percent of our consolidated sales in 2013, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown signs of gradual improvement since 2011, uncertainty continues to exist. in addition, capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, worldwide airline profits, airline consolidation, bankruptcies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and backlog levels. any of these conditions could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. other factors, including future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. additionally, because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2014, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. at times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on 12 table of contents our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending and u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. u.s. government deficit reduction measures, the u.s. government shut-down in 2013, congressional disputes over budgets and debt ceilings and the impact of sequestration have increased market uncertainty and adversely affected our military businesses. should these factors continue and overall u.s. government defense spending decline, it could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flow, profit and backlog for our military businesses. one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phased-out or terminated. reductions in these existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. our business may be affected by government contracting risks. u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more u.s. government investigations relating to certain of our u.s. government contracts. if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any u.s. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages, and/or bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of u.s. government contracts. the u.s. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. debarment generally does not exceed three years. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations, economic conditions and changes in local government regulation. we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 62 percent of our 2013 consolidated sales derived from international operations, including u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (primarily the commercial businesses), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our sales are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the u.s. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro, the canadian dollar, and the polish zloty). for operating units with u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar sales. see note 1 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2013 annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, mexico, russia, south africa and countries in the middle east, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as 13 table of contents our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. emerging market operations can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls. while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. our reliance on suppliers (including third party contract manufacturing) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, contract manufacturer production disruptions, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures. we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and expect to do so in the future. our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities. for example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target's violation of applicable laws, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) or similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-u.s. jurisdictions. we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, or in managing strategic investments. additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. our divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements, following the transaction. under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on us and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the pending transactions, the timing of consummation of these pending transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things. 14 table of contents our debt has increased as a result of the goodrich acquisition; our ability to access debt is subject to increased costs and may be affected by changes in the global capital market, our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings. we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. we incurred substantial additional debt as a result of the goodrich acquisition. our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including, among others: requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions and reinvestment in our businesses; reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. we depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt, including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. the product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier and internally-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop. for example, certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers. these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. as a result, the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace. any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. in addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. we or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, helicopters, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications. our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. in addition, we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to 15 table of contents become obsolete. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require a license from the u.s. department of state, the u.s. department of commerce or the u.s. department of the treasury. as an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the u.s. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. in the u.s., these laws include, among others, the u.s. export administration regulations (ear) administered by the u.s. department of commerce, bureau of industry and security, the international traffic in arms regulations (itar) administered by the u.s. department of state, directorate of defense trade controls (ddtc), and trade sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the u.s. department of the treasury, office of foreign assets control. certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the itar, or represent so-called dual use items governed by the ear. as a result, these products require individual validated licenses in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions. any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties. as previously disclosed, on june 28, 2012, we entered into a consent agreement with the ddtc and a deferred prosecution agreement with the u.s. department of justice regarding separate but related export licensing compliance violations, both of which impose significant continuing obligations. in connection with the foregoing, we entered into an administrative agreement with the department of the army suspension and debarment official, in which army officials determined that we are presently responsible and that further action is not necessary pursuant to the federal acquisition regulation and national defense appropriations act. any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products. the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we are subject to litigation, environmental and other legal compliance risks. we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to product liability, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). as a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. they may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. for a description of current legal proceedings, see "legal proceedings" in in this form 10-k. in addition, the fcpa and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-u.s. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. the fcpa applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. under the fcpa, u.s. companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded u.s. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. certain of our customer relationships outside of the u.s. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to seek to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the fcpa or similar laws. as a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions. changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and 16 table of contents liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. in addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing investigations could be expanded. the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our competitive position, cash flows, results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. see notes 11 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2013 annual report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies. we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected. in order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings. we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business disruptions. our business may be impacted by disruptions, including information technology attacks or failures, threats to physical security, as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). we have experienced cybersecurity attacks and may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we depend on our intellectual property, and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. we also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the u.s. in addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. we may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various 17 table of contents cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 21 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information concerning market risk sensitive instruments, see discussion under the heading market risk and risk management in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2013 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, and under the heading foreign exchange and hedging activity and "financial instruments" in note 1 and in note 14, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in our 2013 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors 11 risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. our global growth may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions. our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices, exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy. these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as

unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. our business may be affected by government contracting risks. u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of u.s. government investigations relating to certain of our u.s. government contracts. if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any u.s. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages, and/or bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of u.s. government contracts. the u.s. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. debarment generally does not exceed three years. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations, economic conditions and changes in local government regulation. we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 61 percent of our 2014 total segment sales derived from international operations, including u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (especially the commercial businesses and p&amp;w canada), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our sales are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the u.s. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro, the canadian dollar, and the polish zloty). for operating units with u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar sales. see note 1 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2014 annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, indonesia, mexico, poland, russia, south africa and countries in the middle east, that carry high levels of currency, 12 table of contents political, compliance and economic risk. we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. emerging market operations can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls. while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. our reliance on suppliers (including third party contract manufacturing) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, contract manufacturer production disruptions, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures. we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and expect to do so in the future. our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities. for example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target's violation of applicable laws, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) or similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-u.s. jurisdictions. we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, or in managing strategic investments. additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. our divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements, following the transaction. under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on us and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the pending transactions, the timing of consummation of these pending transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things. our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences; our ability to access debt may be affected by changes in global capital markets, our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings. we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including, among others: requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions and reinvestment in our businesses; reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and 13 table of contents exposing us to interest rate risk because a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. we depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt, including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. the product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. of particular note, pratt &amp; whitney is currently developing the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft, including the a320neo family of aircraft, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2015. the level of orders received for the purepower family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short timeframe are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. if our production ramp-up efforts are delayed or if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, we may not meet customers' production schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including penalties that could be assessed under existing contractual provisions. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier and internally-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop. for example, certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers. these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. as a result, the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace. any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. in addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. we or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, helicopters, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications. our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. in addition, we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require a license from the u.s. department of state, the u.s. department of commerce or the u.s. department of the treasury. as an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the u.s. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. in the u.s., these laws include, among others, the u.s. export administration regulations (ear) administered by the u.s. department of commerce, bureau of industry and security, the international traffic in arms regulations (itar) administered by the u.s. department of state, 14 table of contents directorate of defense trade controls (ddtc), and trade sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the u.s. department of the treasury, office of foreign assets control. certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the itar, or represent so-called dual use items governed by the ear. as a result, these products require individual validated licenses in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions. any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties. any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products. the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we are subject to product safety, litigation, environmental and other legal compliance risks. we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to product safety, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). as a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. they may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. product recalls and product liability claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) can result in significant costs, including fines, as well as negative publicity, management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. for a description of current legal proceedings, see "legal proceedings" in in this form 10-k. in addition, the fcpa and other anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. the fcpa applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. under the fcpa, u.s. companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded u.s. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. certain of our customer relationships outside of the u.s. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and foreign and other anti-bribery laws. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to seek to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the fcpa or similar laws. as a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions. changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. in addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing investigations could be expanded. the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our competitive position, cash flows, results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. see notes 11 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2014 annual report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies. 15 table of contents we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected. in order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings. we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unforeseen delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by attacks on our information technology infrastructure and other business disruptions. our business may be impacted by disruptions, including information technology attacks or failures, threats to physical security, as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. cybersecurity threats, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks to our it infrastructure and attacks to the it infrastructure of third parties in attempts to gain unauthorized access to confidential, classified or otherwise proprietary information of us and/or our employees, customers and other third parties. such cybersecurity attacks could result in disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). we have experienced cybersecurity attacks and may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we depend on our intellectual property, and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. we also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the u.s. in addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. we may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 21 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information concerning market risk sensitive instruments, see discussion under the heading market risk and risk management in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2014 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, and under the heading foreign exchange and hedging activity and "financial instruments" in note 1 and in note 14, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in our 2014 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors 11 risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. our global growth may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions. our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices, exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy. these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. similarly, this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 52 percent of our consolidated sales in 2015 , are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, global credit market conditions, and other global and political factors. for example, a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate, controls &amp; security. in addition, the financial performance of utc climate, controls &amp; security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business, weather conditions. the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 48 percent of our consolidated sales in 2015 , are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown significant improvement, uncertainty continues to exist. in addition, capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, worldwide airline profits, airline consolidation, bankruptcies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and backlog levels. any of these conditions could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. other factors, including future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. additionally, because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2016 , changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. at times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have 11 table of contents a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending and u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. u.s. government deficit reduction measures, congressional disputes over budgets and debt ceilings and the impact of sequestration have increased market uncertainty and adversely affected our military businesses. should these factors continue and overall u.s. government defense spending decline, it could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flow, profit and backlog for our military businesses. one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phased-out or terminated. reductions in these existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. our business may be affected by government contracting risks. u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of u.s. government investigations relating to certain of our u.s. government contracts. such u.s. government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of u.s. government contracting or of export privileges. for instance, if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any u.s. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could fine and debar us from new u.s. government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years. the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. the u.s. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. our contracts with the u.s. government are also subject to audits. like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports, which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, including because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations, economic conditions and changes in local government regulation. we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 62 percent of our 2015 total segment sales derived from international operations, including u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (especially the commercial businesses and p&amp;w canada), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our sales are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the u.s. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro, the canadian dollar, and the polish zloty). for operating units with u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar sales. see note 1 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for 12 table of contents example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, indonesia, mexico, poland, russia, south africa and countries in the middle east, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. emerging market operations can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls. while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. our reliance on suppliers (including third party contract manufacturing and logistics) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, contract manufacturer production disruptions, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures. we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and expect to do so in the future. our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities. for example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target's violation of applicable laws, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) or similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-u.s. jurisdictions. we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, or in managing strategic investments. additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements, following the transaction. under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the pending transactions, the timing of consummation of these pending transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things. 13 table of contents our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences; our ability to access debt may be affected by changes in global capital markets, our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings. we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including, among others: requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions and reinvestment in our businesses; reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and exposing us to interest rate risk because a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. we depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt, including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued or modified, are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock. quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund with free operating cash flow, borrowings and divestitures. however, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company's stated expectations. decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. additionally, repurchases of our shares will reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. see item 5, "market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" in this form 10-k for a description of our share repurchase program and past share repurchases, including our prior and pending accelerated share repurchase (asr) transactions. we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. the product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. of particular note, pratt &amp; whitney is currently developing the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft, including the a320neo family of aircraft, which entered into service in january 2016. the level of orders received for the purepower family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short timeframe are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. if our production ramp-up efforts are delayed or if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, we may not meet customers' production schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including penalties that could be assessed under existing contractual provisions. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external 14 table of contents performance plans; availability of supplier and internally-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop. for example, certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers. these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. as a result, the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace. any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. in addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. we or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications. our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. in addition, we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require a license from the u.s. department of state, the u.s. department of commerce or the u.s. department of the treasury. as an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the u.s. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. in the u.s., these laws include, among others, the u.s. export administration regulations (ear) administered by the u.s. department of commerce, bureau of industry and security, the international traffic in arms regulations (itar) administered by the u.s. department of state, directorate of defense trade controls (ddtc), and trade sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the u.s. department of the treasury, office of foreign assets control. certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the itar, or represent so-called "dual use" items governed by the ear. as a result, these products require individual validated licenses in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions. any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties. any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products. the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we are subject to litigation, environmental, product safety and other legal and compliance risks. we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to product safety, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). as a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. they may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and 15 table of contents uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over allocation of cleanup costs, alleged personal injuries and alleged property damages. personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our or our subsidiaries' current or former operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees or residents in the area and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. product recalls and product liability claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) also can result in significant costs, including fines, as well as negative publicity, management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. for a description of current material legal proceedings, see "legal proceedings" in in this form 10-k and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 annual report. in addition, the fcpa and other anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. the fcpa applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. under the fcpa, u.s. companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded u.s. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. certain of our customer relationships outside of the u.s. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and foreign and other anti-bribery laws. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to seek to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the fcpa or similar laws. as a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions. changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. in addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing investigations could be expanded. the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our competitive position, cash flows, results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 annual report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies. our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risk that could adversely affect our results. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 annual report for further discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies. we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected. in order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. these plans are intended to 16 table of contents generate operating expense savings through direct cost and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings. we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unforeseen delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by attacks on information technology infrastructure and other cyber-based and business disruptions. our business may be impacted by disruptions, including information technology ("it") attacks or failures, threats to physical security, as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. cyber-based risks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks to our it infrastructure and attacks to the it infrastructure of third parties in attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties. cyber-based risks could also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third party products, facilities or infrastructure. such attacks could result in disruptions to systems (our own or that of third parties), unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). we have experienced cyber-based attacks and may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from these potential attacks. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such attacks or other disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we depend on our intellectual property, and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. we also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the u.s. in addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. we may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 21 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information concerning market risk sensitive instruments, see discussion under the heading "market risk and risk management" in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our 2015 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, and under the heading "foreign exchange and hedging activity" and "financial instruments" in note 1 and in note 14, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors 10 risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. our global growth may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions. our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices, exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy. these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 50 percent of our consolidated sales in 2016 , are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, global credit market conditions, and other global and political factors. for example, a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate, controls &amp; security. in addition, the financial performance of utc climate, controls &amp; security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business, weather conditions. the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 50 percent of our consolidated sales in 2016 , are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, worldwide airline profits, airline consolidation, bankruptcies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and backlog levels. any of these conditions could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. other factors, including future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. additionally, because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2017 , changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. at times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. spare parts sales and aftermarket 10 table of contents service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. the defense industry is also affected by a changing u.s. and global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending and u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. u.s. government deficit reduction measures, congressional and executive branch disputes over budgets and debt ceilings and the impact of sequestration have increased market uncertainty and adversely affected our military businesses. should these factors continue and overall u.s. government defense spending decline, it could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flow, profit and backlog for our military businesses. one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phased-out, limited or terminated. reductions in these existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations, economic conditions and changes in local government regulation. we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 61 percent of our 2016 total segment sales derived from international operations, including u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (especially the commercial businesses and p&amp;w canada), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our sales are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the u.s. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro, the canadian dollar, and the polish zloty). for operating units with u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar sales. see notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016 annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas, capital controls, punitive taxes or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries. the implementation of more restrictive trade policies or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the u.s. or countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. for example, a government's adoption of "buy national" policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, indonesia, mexico, poland, russia, south africa and countries in the middle east, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. emerging market operations can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls. while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or 11 table of contents more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. our reliance on suppliers (including third party contract manufacturing and logistics) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures. we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and expect to continue to do so in the future. our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities. for example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target's violation of applicable laws, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) or other anti-bribery and corruption laws in non-u.s. jurisdictions. we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, or in managing strategic investments. additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements, following the transaction. under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the pending transactions, the timing of consummation of these pending transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things. our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences; our ability to access debt may be affected by changes in global capital markets, our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings. we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including, among others: requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions, reinvestment in our businesses, dividends and repurchases of our common stock; reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and exposing us to interest rate risk because a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. we depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater 12 table of contents difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt, including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued or modified, are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock. quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund with free operating cash flow, borrowings and divestitures. however, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company's stated expectations. decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. additionally, repurchases of our shares will reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. see item 5, "market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" in this form 10-k for a description of our share repurchase program and past share repurchases, including our prior accelerated share repurchase (asr) transactions. we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. the product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. of particular note, pratt &amp; whitney is currently producing the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft, including the a320neo family of aircraft, which entered into service in january 2016. the level of orders received for the purepower family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short timeframe are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. if our production ramp-up efforts are delayed or if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, we may not meet customers' production schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including penalties that could be assessed under existing contractual provisions. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier and internally-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop. for example, certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers. these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. as a result, the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace. any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. in addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. we or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in 13 table of contents what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications. our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. in addition, we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete. in addition, the possibility exists that competitors will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products which attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business may be affected by government contracting risks. most of our government contracts are fixed-price contracts. while fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of u.s. government investigations relating to certain of our u.s. government contracts. such u.s. government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of u.s. government contracting or of export privileges. for instance, if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any u.s. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could fine and debar us from new u.s. government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years. the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. the u.s. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. our contracts with the u.s. government are also subject to audits. like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports, which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, including because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts. exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require authorization from the u.s. department of state, the u.s. department of commerce, or the u.s. department of the treasury or regulatory agencies of other countries. as an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the u.s. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. in the u.s., these laws include, among others, the u.s. export administration regulations (ear) administered by the u.s. department of commerce, bureau of industry and security, the international traffic in arms regulations (itar) administered by the u.s. department of state, directorate of defense trade controls and trade sanctions regulations and embargoes administered by the u.s. department of the treasury, office of foreign assets control. certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the itar and the commerce control list of the ear, or represent so-called "dual use" items governed by the ear. as a result, these products may require prior authorization to be exported to certain jurisdictions. any failures by us or our customers or suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity or restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties. any changes in export or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products. the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 14 table of contents we are subject to litigation, environmental, product safety and other legal and compliance risks. we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to product safety, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). as a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. they may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over allocation of cleanup costs, alleged personal injuries and alleged property damage. personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our or our subsidiaries' current or former operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees or residents in the area and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. product recalls and product liability claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) also can result in significant costs, including fines, as well as negative publicity, management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. for a description of current material legal proceedings, see "legal proceedings" in in this form 10-k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016 annual report. in addition, the fcpa and other anti-bribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. the fcpa applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. under the fcpa, u.s. companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded u.s. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. certain of our customer relationships outside of the u.s. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other anti-bribery and corruption laws. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and corruption laws. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to seek to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the fcpa or similar laws. as a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions. changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. in addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing investigations could be expanded. the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our competitive position, cash flows, results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016 annual report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies. our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risk that could adversely affect our results. 15 table of contents the performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016 annual report for further discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies. we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected. in order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct cost and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings. we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by attacks on information technology infrastructure and other cyber-based and business disruptions. our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third party information technology ( it ) infrastructure, which could result from (among other causes) attacks on or failures of such infrastructure, compromises to its physical security, as well as from damaging weather or other acts of nature. cyber-based risks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our it infrastructure and attacks on the it infrastructure of third parties (both on premises and in the cloud) in attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties. cyber-based risks could also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third party products, facilities or infrastructure. such attacks could result in disruptions to systems (our own or those of third parties), unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). we have experienced cyber-based attacks and may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from these potential attacks. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such attacks or other disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we depend on our intellectual property, and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. we also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the u.s. in addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. we may also be subject to disruptions, losses 16 table of contents and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 20 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information concerning market risk sensitive instruments, see discussion under the heading "market risk and risk management" in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our 2016 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, and under the heading "foreign exchange and hedging activity" and "financial instruments" in note 1 and in note 14, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors 11 risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. our global growth may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions. our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices, exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy. these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. 11 table of contents our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 50 percent of our consolidated sales in 2017 , are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, global credit market conditions, and other global and political factors. for example, a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate, controls &amp; security. in addition, the financial performance of utc climate, controls &amp; security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business, weather conditions. the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 50 percent of our consolidated sales in 2017 , are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, worldwide airline profits, airline consolidation, bankruptcies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and backlog levels. any of these conditions could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. other factors, including future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. additionally, because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2018 , changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. at times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. the defense industry is also affected by a changing u.s. and global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending and u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. should overall u.s. government defense spending decline, it could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flow, profit and backlog for our military businesses. one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phased-out, limited or terminated. reductions in these existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations, economic conditions and changes in local government regulation. we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 61 percent of our 2017 total segment sales derived from international operations, including u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (especially the commercial businesses and p&amp;wc), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our sales are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the u.s. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro, the canadian dollar, and the polish zloty). for operating units with u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar sales. see notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017 annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies. 12 table of contents our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas, capital controls, punitive taxes or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries. the implementation of more restrictive trade policies or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the u.s. or countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. for example, a government's adoption of "buy national" policies or retaliation by another government against such policies, such as tariffs, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, indonesia, mexico, poland, russia, south africa, ukraine and countries in the middle east, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. emerging market operations can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls. while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. our reliance on suppliers (including third-party contract manufacturing and logistics) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures. we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, including the pending acquisition of rockwell collins, and expect to continue to do so in the future. our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities. for example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target's violation of applicable laws, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) or other anti-bribery and corruption laws in non-u.s. jurisdictions. we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, or in managing strategic investments. additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, 13 table of contents accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements, following the transaction. under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. the success of future acquisitions, including the rockwell collins transaction, and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the pending transactions, the timing of consummation of these pending transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things. we also enter into joint ventures in which we maintain significant influence, but do not control the businesses. accordingly, our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to these businesses is limited and can result in additional financial and reputational risks. we may not complete the acquisition of rockwell collins or complete the acquisition within the time frame we anticipate; the acquired business may underperform relative to our expectations; the acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community; we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated synergies. the completion of the acquisition of rockwell collins is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. any delay in completing the acquisition could cause utc not to realize some or all of the benefits, or realize them on a different timeline than expected, that utc expects to achieve if the acquisition is successfully completed within the expected time frame. in addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents for the acquisition that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company's business or may materially delay the completion of the acquisition. the ultimate success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on utc's ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of utc and rockwell collins, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies, from the acquisition. if utc is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of utc's common stock may decline. the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation: the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the devotion of management's attention to the acquisition; managing a larger combined aerospace systems business; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and employees and other counterparties, as may be impacted by contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the acquisition, and attracting new business and operational relationships; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; coordinating geographically separate organizations; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the acquisition. our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences; our ability to access debt may be affected by changes in global capital markets, our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings. we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. in connection with the rockwell collins merger, we anticipate that approximately $15 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration. we expect to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration through debt issuances and cash on hand. we expect to assume approximately $7 billion of rockwell collins' outstanding debt upon completion of the merger. the increased indebtedness of utc in connection with the merger may have the effect of, among other things: a downgrade of our credit ratings resulting in increased borrowing costs; 14 table of contents requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions, reinvestment in our businesses, dividends and repurchases of our common stock; reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and exposing us to interest rate risk at the time of refinancing outstanding debt or on the portion of our debt obligations that are issued at variable rates. we depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt, including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. in particular, following the announcement of the proposed rockwell collins acquisition, the credit rating agencies announced that they were reviewing our credit ratings for possible downgrades. quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued or modified, are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock. quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund with free operating cash flow, borrowings and divestitures. however, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company's stated expectations. decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. to help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the pending rockwell collins acquisition, we have, among other things, suspended share repurchases, excluding activity relating to our employee savings plans. as we continue to assess the impacts of the tcja, future opportunities for repatriation of our non-u.s. earnings, and accelerated de-leveraging, we may consider, in addition to investments in our operations, limited additional share repurchases to offset the effects of dilution related to our stock-based compensation programs - see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017 annual report. the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. see item 5, "market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" in this form 10-k for a description of our share repurchase program and past share repurchases, including our prior accelerated share repurchase (asr) transactions. we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. the product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. of particular note, pratt &amp; whitney is currently producing and delivering the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft, including the a320neo family of aircraft, which entered into service in january 2016. the level of orders received for the purepower family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. if any of our production ramp-up efforts are delayed, if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, and/or if we identify or experience issues with in-service engines, we may not meet customers' production schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including penalties that could be assessed under existing contractual provisions. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability 15 table of contents of supplier and internally produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance, repair and overhaul services on our products; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop. for example, certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers. these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. as a result, the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace. any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. in addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. we or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. due to the design complexity of our products, in the future we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications. our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. in addition, we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. the possibility also exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete. in addition, the possibility exists that competitors will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products which attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business may be affected by government contracting risks. most of our government contracts are fixed-price contracts. while fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs. u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of u.s. government investigations relating to certain of our u.s. government contracts. such u.s. government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of u.s. government contracting or of export privileges. for instance, if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any u.s. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could fine and debar us from new u.s. government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years. the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. the u.s. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. our contracts with the u.s. government are also subject to audits. like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports, which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, including because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts. we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us even if such allegations are later determined to be false. 16 table of contents exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control and sanctions regulations and may require authorization from the u.s. department of state, the u.s. department of commerce, the u.s. department of the treasury or regulatory agencies of other countries. we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the u.s. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. in the u.s., these laws include, among others, the export administration regulations (ear) administered by the u.s. department of commerce, the international traffic in arms regulations (itar) administered by the u.s. department of state and embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the u.s. department of the treasury. certain of our products, services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the u.s. munitions list of the itar and the commerce control list of the ear, or are otherwise subject to the ear. in addition, u.s. foreign policy may restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in business dealings with certain individuals, entities or countries. as a result, our ability to export our products or services to certain countries or for particular end-uses or end-users may require authorization. any failure by us or our customers or suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to export our products, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the u.s. government. moreover, any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we are subject to litigation, environmental, product safety and other legal and compliance risks. we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. these risks relate to, among other things, product safety, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). as a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. they may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs, alleged personal injuries and alleged property damage. personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our or our subsidiaries' current or former operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees or residents in the area and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. product recalls and product liability claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) also can result in significant costs, including fines, as well as negative publicity, management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. in addition, the fcpa and other anti-bribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. the fcpa applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. u.s. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded u.s. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. certain of our customer relationships outside of the u.s. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other anti-bribery and corruption laws. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and corruption laws. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to seek to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the fcpa or similar laws. as a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or 17 table of contents enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. for a description of current material legal proceedings and regulatory matters, see "legal proceedings" in in this form 10-k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017 annual report. additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions. changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. in addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing investigations could be expanded. the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our competitive position, cash flows, results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings "business overview", "results of operations - income taxes," and "liquidity and financial condition" and notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017 annual report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies, including our provisional accounting and assessment of the effect of the tcja. our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risk that could adversely affect our results. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017 annual report for further discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies. we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected. in order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through reductions in direct and indirect expenses as well as other savings. we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any future restructuring activities, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by attacks on information technology infrastructure and other cyber-based and business disruptions. our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology ( it ) infrastructure, which could result from (among other causes) cyber-attacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security, as well as from damaging weather or other acts of nature. cyber-based risks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our it infrastructure and attacks on the it infrastructure of third parties (both on premises and in the cloud) attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties. cyber-based risks could also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties, impact business operations, result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. we have experienced cyber-based attacks, and due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. we continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to 18 table of contents enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from potential cyber-attacks. however, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period. we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. we depend on our intellectual property, and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. we also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the u.s. in addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of, and ownership or necessary licenses concerning, data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. we may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 21 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information concerning market risk sensitive instruments, see discussion under the heading "market risk and risk management" in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our 2017 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, and under the headings "foreign exchange" and "derivatives and 21 table of contents hedging activity" in note 1 and "financial instruments" in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors 11 risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. our global growth may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions. our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices, exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy. these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, and impact the ability of our customers to make payments. similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer 11 table of contents spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 47 percent of our consolidated sales in 2018 , are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, global credit market conditions, and other global and political factors, including trade policies. a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and carrier. in addition, the financial performance of carrier can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business, weather conditions. the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 53 percent of our consolidated sales in 2018 , are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline profits, airline consolidation, bankruptcies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and rpo levels. any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. other factors, including future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. additionally, because a substantial portion of the rpo for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2019 , changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. at times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price or cost-share development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. the defense industry is also affected by a changing u.s. and global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending and u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. should overall u.s. government defense spending decline, it could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flow, profit and rpo for our military businesses. one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phased-out, limited or terminated. reductions in these existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations, economic conditions, trade policies, and changes in local government regulation. we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 63 percent of our 2018 total segment sales derived from international operations, including u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (especially the commercial businesses and p&amp;wc), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our sales are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the u.s. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro, the canadian dollar, the british pound and the polish zloty). for operating units with u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage certain exposures, 12 table of contents we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar sales. see notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018 annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas, capital controls, taxes or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs, can affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries. the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the u.s. or by countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products, including in connection with the u.k.'s pending withdrawal from the eu, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. for example, a government's adoption of "buy national" policies or retaliation by another government against such policies, such as tariffs, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, indonesia, mexico, poland, russia, south africa, turkey, ukraine and countries in the middle east, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. emerging market operations can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, the imposition of exchange and capital controls, and the risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. our reliance on suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers and logistics providers) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we may not complete the separation transactions or complete them within the time frame we anticipate; the separation transactions may present difficulties that could have an adverse effect on us and/or the independent businesses resulting from the separation, and/or costs associated with the separation transactions may be higher than anticipated; the independent businesses may underperform relative to our expectations; we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the separation transactions. on november 26, 2018, we announced our intention to separate into three independent companies: (1) utc, an aerospace company comprised of the collins aerospace systems and pratt &amp; whitney businesses, (2) otis, and (3) carrier. the proposed separations are expected to be effected through spin-offs by utc of otis and carrier that are intended to be tax-free for the company's shareowners for u.s. federal income tax purposes. these separation transactions will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, final 13 table of contents approval by utc's board of directors, receipt of tax rulings in certain jurisdictions and/or a tax opinion from external counsel (as applicable), the filing with the sec and effectiveness of form 10 registration statements for otis and carrier and satisfactory completion of financing. the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the separation transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all. additionally, the separation transactions are complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment and market conditions or regulatory or political conditions may affect our ability to complete one or both of the separation transactions as currently expected, within the anticipated time frame or at all. any changes to one or both of the separation transactions or delay in completing one or both of the separation transactions could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits, or realize them on a different timeline than expected. in addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies or may materially delay the completion of one or both of the separation transactions. and, although we intend for the separation transactions to be tax-free to the company's shareowners for u.s. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will so qualify. if the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we, the company's shareowners and/or the new independent companies would incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. furthermore, if the separation transactions are completed, we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful. whether or not the separation transactions are completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions, including, without limitation: the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of utc (including otis and carrier) as a result of the devotion of management's attention to the separation transactions; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; execution and related risks in connection with utc, otis and carrier financing transactions undertaken in connection with the separation transactions; foreseen and unforeseen dis-synergy costs, costs of restructuring transactions (including taxes) and other significant costs and expenses; and potential negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the separation transactions as currently expected, within the anticipated time frame or at all. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock. in addition, if the separation transactions are completed, each of the separate companies will incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. those costs may exceed our estimates or could diminish the benefits we expect to realize from the separation transactions. if the separation transactions are completed, utc and the independent businesses' operational and financial profiles will change and each will be a smaller, less diversified company than utc as it exists today. the separation transactions will result in utc, otis and carrier being smaller, less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries. of note, utc's businesses following the expected separation transactions will be significantly more reliant on three customers, namely airbus, boeing and the u.s. government. as a result, each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company's results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and service debt may be diminished. it is anticipated that the effective tax rate for each separate company will differ from the utc consolidated effective tax rate. if the separation transactions are completed, there may be changes in our shareowner base, which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate . investors holding our common stock may hold our common stock because of a decision to invest in a company that operates in multiple markets with a diversified portfolio. if the separation transactions are completed, shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a business concentrated in the commercial aerospace and defense industry, 14 table of contents and shares of the common stock of the new independent companies conducting the otis and carrier businesses will represent investments in businesses concentrated in their respective industries. these changes may not match some shareowners' investment strategies, which could cause them to sell their shares of our common stock or the common stock of the new independent companies, and excessive selling pressure could cause the market price to decrease following the consummation of the separation transactions. additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions. we engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures. we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint ventures intended to complement and expand our businesses. we expect to continue to undertake such transactions in the future. our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities. for example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target's violation of applicable laws, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) or similar anti-bribery and corruption laws in non-u.s. jurisdictions. we also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, or in managing strategic investments. additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements, following the transaction. under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the pending transactions, the timing of consummation of these pending transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things. we also enter into joint ventures in which we maintain significant influence, but do not control the businesses. accordingly, our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to these businesses is limited and can result in additional financial and reputational risks. the rockwell collins acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community; we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated synergies. the ultimate success of the rockwell collins acquisition will depend, in part, on utc's ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of utc and rockwell collins, and realize the anticipated benefits, including revenue and cost synergies, innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies, from the acquisition. if utc is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of utc's common stock may decline as a result. the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation: the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at collins aerospace systems as a result of the devotion of management's attention to the integration; managing a larger combined aerospace systems business; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and other counterparties, as may be impacted by contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the acquisition, and attracting new business and operational relationships; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; coordinating geographically separate organizations; 15 table of contents unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; increased competitive pressure from customers; and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the acquisition. our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences; our ability to access debt may be affected by our increased indebtedness, changes in global capital markets, our financial performance or outlook, the expected separation transactions or our credit ratings. we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. in connection with the rockwell collins acquisition, we issued $11 billion of aggregate principal notes, and $7.8 billion of rockwell collins debt remained outstanding at the time of the closing of the acquisition. as expected, the completion of the acquisition resulted in a downgrade of utc's long-term issuer credit ratings by one notch. following the announcement of the expected separation transactions, one credit agency placed utc's long-term issuer credit rating on negative outlook. the expected separation transactions and the increased indebtedness of utc in connection with the rockwell collins acquisition may have the effect of, among other things: requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt or the payment of costs associated with the separation transactions, which will reduce funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions, reinvestment in our businesses, dividends and repurchases of our common stock; reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; exposing us to interest rate risk at the time of refinancing outstanding debt or on the portion of our debt obligations that are issued at variable rates; and further downgrades of our credit ratings resulting in increased borrowing costs. we depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt, including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued or modified, are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock. quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund with free operating cash flow, borrowings and divestitures. however, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company's stated expectations. decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. to help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the rockwell collins acquisition and the proposed separation transactions, we have limited our share repurchases. the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. see item 5, "market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" in this form 10-k for a description of our share repurchase program and past share repurchases. 16 table of contents we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. the product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. of particular note, pratt &amp; whitney is currently producing and delivering the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft, including the a320neo family of aircraft, which entered into service in january 2016. the level of orders received for the purepower family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. if any of our production ramp-up efforts are delayed, if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, and/or if we identify or experience issues with in-service engines, we may not meet customers' production schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance, repair and overhaul services on our products; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of products we manufacture, or that incorporate technologies we develop. for example, our customers manufacture end products and larger aerospace systems that incorporate certain of our aerospace products. these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. as a result, the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our products in the marketplace. development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. in addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. we or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. due to the design complexity of our products, we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications. our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. in addition, we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. furthermore, our competitors, including our customers, may develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. the possibility also exists that our competitors might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete. in addition, the possibility exists that competitors will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products which attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business may be affected by government contracting risks. most of our contracts with the u.s. government are fixed price, which subjects us to the risk of reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs, performance improvements, or efficiencies. 17 table of contents u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default. if terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to recover payment for work completed and certain termination costs. if terminated for default, the government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the undelivered goods or services from another source as well as other damages resulting from the default. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of u.s. government investigations relating to our u.s. government contracts. such u.s. government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of u.s. government contracting or of export privileges. for instance, if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a u.s. government investigation (including fraud, or violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could fine and debar us from new u.s. government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. our contracts with the u.s. government are also subject to audit. like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports recommending that certain contract prices should be reduced, or that certain payments should be delayed, refunded or withheld to comply with various government regulations, including reports alleging that cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices was incomplete or that cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations. some of these audit reports involve substantial amounts, of which those that allege noncompliance with the cost accounting practices associated with our military engine business could, if the audit reports' theories were to prevail in litigation, increase the costs absorbed by our commercial engine business in the future. exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control and sanctions regulations and may require authorization from the u.s. department of state, the u.s. department of commerce, the u.s. department of the treasury or regulatory agencies of other countries. we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the u.s. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. in the u.s., these laws include, among others, the export administration regulations (ear) administered by the u.s. department of commerce, the international traffic in arms regulations (itar) administered by the u.s. department of state and embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the u.s. department of the treasury. certain of our products, services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the u.s. munitions list of the itar and the commerce control list of the ear, or are otherwise subject to the ear. in addition, u.s. foreign policy may restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in business dealings with certain individuals, entities or countries. as a result, our ability to export our products or services to certain countries or for particular end-uses or end-users may require authorization. any failure by us or our customers or suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to export our products, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the u.s. government. moreover, any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we are subject to litigation, environmental, product safety and other legal and compliance risks. we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. these risks relate to, among other things, product safety, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). as a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. they may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, 18 table of contents including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. climate-related events also could disrupt our businesses and require us to incur additional costs. at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs, alleged personal injuries and alleged property damage. personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our or our subsidiaries' current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees, third-parties' employees or residents in the area, and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. product recalls and product liability claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) also can result in significant costs, including fines, as well as negative publicity, management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. in addition, the fcpa and other anti-bribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. the fcpa applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. u.s. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded u.s. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. certain of our customer relationships outside of the u.s. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other anti-bribery and corruption laws. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and corruption laws. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the fcpa or similar laws. as a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. cybersecurity and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which increase our costs, may affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. for a description of current material legal proceedings and regulatory matters, see "legal proceedings" in in this form 10-k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018 annual report. additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions. changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. in addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing investigations could be expanded. the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our competitive position, cash flows, results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings "business overview, ""results of operations - income taxes," and "liquidity and financial condition" and notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018 annual report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies, including our accounting and assessment of the effect of the tcja. our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risk that could adversely affect our results. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our 19 table of contents funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018 annual report for further discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies. we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected. in order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through reductions in direct and indirect expenses as well as improved efficiencies. we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any future restructuring activities, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks on information technology infrastructure and products and other business disruptions our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology ( it ) infrastructure, which could result from (among other causes) cyber-attacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security, as well as from damaging weather or other acts of nature. cyber-based risks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our it infrastructure and attacks on the it infrastructure of third parties (both on premises and in the cloud) attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties. cyber-based risks could also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties, impact business operations, result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. we have experienced cyber-based attacks, and due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. we continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from potential cyber-attacks. however, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period. we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. we depend on our intellectual property, and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. we also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the u.s. in addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or 20 table of contents services. our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of, and ownership or necessary licenses concerning, data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. we may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 23 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information concerning market risk sensitive instruments, see discussion under the heading "market risk and risk management" in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our 2018 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, and under the headings "foreign exchange" and "derivatives and hedging activity" in note 1 and "financial instruments" in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors 13 risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. our global growth may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions. our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices, exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy. these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, and impact the ability of our customers to make payments. similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. the results of our commercial businesses, which generated approximately 41 percent of our consolidated sales in 2019, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, global credit market conditions, and other global and political factors, including trade policies. a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and carrier. in addition, the financial performance of carrier can be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business, weather conditions. the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 59 percent of our consolidated sales in 2019, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and services by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline profits, airline consolidation, bankruptcies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and rpo levels. any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. other factors, including future terrorist actions, aviation safety concerns, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. additionally, because a substantial portion of product deliveries to commercial aerospace customers are scheduled for delivery beyond 2020, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. at times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price or cost-share development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is ready to enter into service. a reduction in spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. the defense industry is also affected by a changing u.s. and global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending, u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. should overall u.s. government defense spending decline, it could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flow, profit and rpo for our military businesses. one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phased-out, limited or terminated. reductions in these existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. 13 our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations, economic conditions, trade policies, and changes in local government regulation. we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 60% percent of our 2019 total segment sales derived from international operations, including u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (especially the commercial businesses and p&amp;wc), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our sales are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the u.s. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro, the canadian dollar, the british pound and the polish zloty). for operating units with u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar sales. see notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2019 annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas, capital controls, taxes or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs, can affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries. the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the u.s. or by countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products, including in connection with the united kingdom's pending withdrawal from the european union, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. for example, a government's adoption of "buy national" policies or retaliation by another government against such policies, such as tariffs, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, indonesia, mexico, poland, russia, south africa, turkey, ukraine and countries in the middle east and central asia, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. we expect that sales to these and other emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. emerging market operations can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, the imposition of exchange and capital controls, and the risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. of note, in 2019 the u.s. government suspended turkey's participation in the f-35 joint strike fighter program because turkey accepted delivery of the russian-built s-400 air and missile defense system. the u.s. has imposed, and may impose additional, sanctions on turkey as a result of this or other political disputes. turkish companies supply components, some of which are sole-sourced, to our aerospace businesses for commercial and military engines and aerospace products. depending upon the scope and timing of u.s. sanctions on turkey and potential reciprocal actions, if any, such sanctions or actions could impact our aerospace businesses' sources of supply and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production 14 disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. our reliance on suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers and logistics providers) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we may not complete the separation transactions or complete them within the time frame we anticipate; the separation transactions may present difficulties that could have an adverse effect on us and/or the independent businesses resulting from the separation, and/or costs associated with the separation transactions may be higher than anticipated; the independent businesses may underperform relative to our expectations; we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the separation transactions. in november 2018, we announced our intention to separate into three independent companies: (1) utc, an aerospace company comprised of the collins aerospace systems and pratt &amp; whitney businesses, (2) otis, and (3) carrier. the proposed separations are expected to be effected through spin-offs by utc of otis and carrier that are intended to be tax-free for the company's shareowners for u.s. federal income tax purposes. these separation transactions will be subject to utc's agreement to consummate the distributions pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the raytheon merger agreement discussed below, as well as the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, final approval by utc's board of directors, receipt of tax rulings and a tax opinion from external counsel, the filing with the sec and effectiveness of form 10 registration statements for otis and carrier and satisfactory completion of financing. though utc has agreed pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of the raytheon merger agreement, that utc will consummate separation transactions, the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the separation transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all. additionally, the separation transactions are complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment and market conditions or regulatory or political conditions may affect our ability to complete one or both of the separation transactions as currently expected, within the anticipated time frame or at all. any changes to one or both of the separation transactions or delay in completing one or both of the separation transactions could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits, or realize them on a different timeline than expected. in addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies or may materially delay the completion of one or both of the separation transactions. and, although we intend for the separation transactions to be tax-free to the company's shareowners for u.s. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will so qualify. if the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we, the company's shareowners and/or the new independent companies would incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. furthermore, if the separation transactions are completed, we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful. whether or not the separation transactions are completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions, including, without limitation: the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of utc (including otis and carrier) as a result of the devotion of management's attention to the separation transactions; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; execution and related risks in connection with utc, otis and carrier financing transactions undertaken in connection with the separation transactions; foreseen and unforeseen dis-synergy costs, costs of restructuring transactions (including taxes) and other significant costs and expenses; and 15 potential negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the separation transactions as currently expected, within the anticipated time frame or at all. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock. in addition, if the separation transactions are completed, each of the separate companies will incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. those costs may exceed our estimates or could diminish the benefits we expect to realize from the separation transactions. if the separation transactions are completed, utc and the independent businesses' operational and financial profiles will change and each will be a less diversified company than utc as it exists today. the separation transactions will result in utc, otis and carrier being less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries. of note, even if the combination with raytheon is completed, utc's businesses following the expected separation transactions will be significantly more reliant on three customers, namely airbus, boeing and the u.s. government. as a result, each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company's results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and service debt may be diminished. it is anticipated that the effective tax rate for each separate company will differ from the utc consolidated effective tax rate. if the separation transactions are completed, there may be changes in our shareowner base, which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate . investors holding our common stock may hold our common stock because of a decision to invest in a company that operates in multiple markets with a diversified portfolio. if the separation transactions are completed, shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a business concentrated in the commercial aerospace and defense industry, and shares of the common stock of the new independent companies conducting the otis and carrier businesses will represent investments in businesses concentrated in their respective industries. these changes may not match some shareowners' investment strategies, which could cause them to sell their shares of our common stock or the common stock of the new independent companies, and excessive selling pressure could cause the market price to decrease following the consummation of the separation transactions. additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions. we may not complete the combination with raytheon or complete the combination within the time frame we anticipate; the combined business may underperform relative to our expectations; the combination may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community; we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits. the completion of the combination with raytheon is subject to a number of conditions. the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the combination for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. any delay in completing the combination could cause utc not to realize some or all of the benefits that utc expects to achieve if the combination is successfully completed within the expected timeframe, or could cause utc to realize such benefits on a different timeline than expected. in addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents for the combination that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company's business or may materially delay the completion of the combination. moreover, the completion of the combination is subject to, among other conditions, the completion of the spin-offs of otis and carrier, which are themselves subject to a number of conditions (subject to utc's agreement to consummate the distributions pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the raytheon merger agreement). any delay in or prevention of the completion of the spin-offs could delay or prevent the completion of the combination. the success of the combination will depend, in part, on the combined company's ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of utc and raytheon and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies, from the combination. if the combined company is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of the combined company's common stock may decline. 16 the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation: managing larger combined aerospace systems and defense businesses; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and employees and other counterparties, as may be impacted by contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the combination, and attracting new business and operational relationships; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; the possibility of significant costs involved in connection with completing the merger, including costs to achieve expected synergies; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; coordinating geographically separate organizations; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the combination. we engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures. we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions, including the acquisition of rockwell collins in november 2018, and have entered into joint ventures intended to complement and expand our businesses. we expect to continue to undertake such transactions in the future. our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities. for example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target's violation of applicable laws, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) or similar anti-bribery and corruption laws in non-u.s. jurisdictions. we also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, including the rockwell collins businesses, with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, or in managing strategic investments. additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, continued supply and services arrangements, or potential litigation, following the transaction. under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the pending transactions, the timing of consummation of these pending transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things. we also enter into joint ventures in which we maintain significant influence, but do not control the businesses. accordingly, our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to these businesses is limited and can result in additional financial and reputational risks. our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences; our ability to access debt may be affected by our increased indebtedness, changes in global capital markets, our financial performance or outlook, the expected separation transactions or our credit ratings. we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. in connection with the rockwell collins acquisition, we issued $11 billion of aggregate principal notes and $7.8 billion of rockwell collins debt remained outstanding at the time of the closing of the acquisition. as expected, the completion of the acquisition resulted in a downgrade of utc's long-term issuer credit ratings by one notch. following the announcement of the expected separation transactions, one credit agency placed utc's long-term issuer credit rating on negative outlook. the expected separation transactions and the increased indebtedness of utc in connection with the rockwell collins acquisition may have the effect of, among other things: requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt or the payment of costs associated with the separation transactions, which will reduce funds we have available 17 for other purposes, such as acquisitions, reinvestment in our businesses, dividends and repurchases of our common stock; reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; exposing us to interest rate risk at the time the outstanding debt is refinanced or on the portion of our debt obligations that are issued at variable rates; and further downgrades of our credit ratings resulting in increased borrowing costs. we depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations. if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt, including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued or modified, are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock. quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund with operating free cash flow, borrowings and divestitures. however, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, including in connection with the separation transactions and the raytheon merger, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company's stated expectations. decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. to help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the rockwell collins acquisition and the proposed separation transactions, we have limited our share repurchases.our ability to repurchase shares is also restricted by the raytheon merger agreement. the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. see item 5, "market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" in this form 10-k for a description of our share repurchase program and past share repurchases. we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. the product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. of particular note, pratt &amp; whitney is currently producing and delivering the pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft, including the a320neo family of aircraft. the level of orders received for the geared turbofan family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. if any of our production ramp-up efforts are delayed, if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, and/or if we identify or experience issues with in-service engines, we may not meet customers' delivery schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance, repair and overhaul services on our products; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level 18 of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of products we manufacture or that incorporate technologies we develop. for example, our customers manufacture end products and larger aerospace systems that incorporate certain of our aerospace products. these systems and end products may also incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. as a result, the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our products in the marketplace. development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. in addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. we or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. due to the design complexity of our products or those of our customers or third party manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs or our customers products, we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products or we may experience the suspension of production after these products enter into service due to safety concerns. delays and/or suspension of production could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development, pending required certifications or after entry into service. our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. in addition, we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts if theses targets are not achieved when required. furthermore, our competitors, including our customers, may develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. the possibility also exists that our competitors or customers might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete. in addition, the possibility exists that competitors or customers will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products which attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business may be affected by government contracting risks. most of our contracts with the u.s. government are fixed price, which subjects us to the risk of reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs, performance improvements, or efficiencies. u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default. if terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to recover payment for work completed and certain termination costs. if terminated for default, the government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the undelivered goods or services from another source as well as other damages resulting from the default. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of u.s. government investigations relating to our u.s. government contracts. such u.s. government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of u.s. government contracting or of export privileges. for instance, if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a u.s. government investigation (including fraud, or violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could fine and debar us from new u.s. government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. 19 like many defense contractors, our contracts with the u.s. government are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts, which could, if the audit reports' theories were to prevail in litigation, increase the costs absorbed by our commercial engine business in the future. we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. the company may be, and has been, required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. if the litigation is resolved in the company's favor, any such payments will be returned to the company with interest. exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control and sanctions regulations and may require authorization from the u.s. department of state, the u.s. department of commerce, the u.s. department of the treasury or regulatory agencies of other countries. we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the u.s. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. in the u.s., these laws include, among others, the export administration regulations (ear) administered by the u.s. department of commerce, the international traffic in arms regulations (itar) administered by the u.s. department of state and embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the u.s. department of the treasury. certain of our products, services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the u.s. munitions list of the itar and the commerce control list of the ear, or are otherwise subject to the ear. in addition, u.s. foreign policy may restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in business dealings with certain individuals, entities or countries. as a result, our ability to export our products or services to certain countries or for particular end-uses or end-users may require authorization. any failure by us or our customers or suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to export our products, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the u.s. government. moreover, any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we are subject to litigation, environmental, product safety, anti-corruption and other legal and compliance risks. we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. these risks relate to, among other things, product safety, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. we or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). as a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the u.s. and in other countries in which we operate. those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. they may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. climate-related events also could disrupt our businesses and require us to incur additional costs. at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs, alleged personal injuries and alleged property damage. personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees, third-parties' employees or residents in the area, and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. 20 product recalls and product liability claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) also can result in significant costs, including fines, as well as negative publicity, management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. in addition, the fcpa and other anti-bribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. the fcpa applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. u.s. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded u.s. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. certain of our customer relationships outside of the u.s. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other anti-bribery and corruption laws. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and corruption laws. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent violations of the fcpa or similar laws. we previously have been subject to regulatory investigations for alleged violations of anti-bribery laws, and could be subject to such investigations in the future, which could result in criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. cybersecurity and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which increase our costs, may affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. for a description of current material legal proceedings and regulatory matters, see "legal proceedings" in in this form 10-k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2019 annual report. additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions. changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. in addition to ongoing examinations, there could be additional examinations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing examinations could be expanded. the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional examinations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our competitive position, cash flows, results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of examinations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" under the headings "business overview, ""results of operations - income taxes," and "liquidity and financial condition" and notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2019 annual report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies, including our accounting and assessment of the effect of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ( tcja). our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risk that could adversely affect our results. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2019 annual report for further discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies. we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected. in order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through reductions in direct and indirect expenses as well as improved efficiencies. we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any future restructuring activities, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce 21 reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks on information technology infrastructure and products and other business disruptions our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology (it) infrastructure, which could result from (among other causes) cyber-attacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security, as well as from damaging weather or other acts of nature. cyber-based risks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our it infrastructure and attacks on the it infrastructure of third parties (both on premises and in the cloud) attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties. cyber-based risks could also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties, impact business operations, result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. we have experienced cyber-based attacks, and due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. the threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors. we continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from potential cyber-attacks. however, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period. we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. we depend on our intellectual property, and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. we also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the u.s. in addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of, and ownership or necessary licenses concerning, data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. we may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 22 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 25 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information concerning

hamilton sundstrand segment. this business will complement hamilton sundstrand aerospace products and services. hamilton sundstrand principal industrial products, such as air compressors, metering pumps and fluid handling equipment, serve industries involved with raw material processing, bulk material handling, construction, mining, hydrocarbon and chemical processing, and water and wastewater treatment. these products are sold directly to end-users, through manufacturer representatives and distributors and through engineering contractors. demand for hamilton sundstrand industrial products is tied closely to the level of general economic activity. revenues generated by hamilton sundstrand international operations, including u.s. export sales, were 45 percent and 43 percent of total hamilton sundstrand segment revenues in 2005 and 2004, respectively. at december 31, 2005, hamilton sundstrand business backlog was $2,823 million, including $805 million under u.s. government funded contracts and subcontracts, as compared to $2,064 million and $479 million, respectively, at december 31, 2004. of the total hamilton sundstrand backlog at december 31, 2005, approximately $2,182 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2006. sikorsky sikorsky is one of the world largest manufacturers of military and commercial helicopters and also provides aftermarket helicopter and

low rate initial production contract for new uh-60m black hawk advanced utility helicopters. this contract is the last phase before the army makes the full rate production decision. development of the h-92 helicopter for military markets has commenced. in 2005, sikorsky also announced the development of the s-76d helicopter, which is expected to be the next generation of the s-76 helicopter. in september 2004, sikorsky acquired schweizer aircraft, which specializes in the light helicopter, reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) markets. in december 2005, sikorsky acquired keystone ranger holdings, inc., a provider of helicopter completion, overhaul and repair services and flight operations. sikorsky aftermarket business includes spare parts sales, overhaul and repair services, maintenance contracts, and logistics support programs for helicopters and other aircraft. sales are made directly by sikorsky and also by sikorsky subsidiaries and joint ventures. sikorsky is increasingly engaging in logistics support programs and partnering with its government and commercial customers to manage and provide maintenance and repair services. 4 table of contents as previously disclosed, in march 2004 the u.s. army decided to terminate the rah-66 comanche helicopter program. the sikorsky- boeing joint venture that worked on the program is in the final stages of the termination process with the u.s. army. revenues generated by sikorsky international operations, including u.s. export sales, were 31 percent and 24 percent of total sikorsky revenues in each of 2005 and 2004, respectively. at december 31, 2005, sikorsky business backlog was $7,531 million, including $2,261 million under u.s. government funded contracts and subcontracts, as compared to $6,916 million and $2,349 million, respectively, at december 31, 2004. of the total sikorsky backlog at december 31, 2005, approximately $2,561 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2006. competition and other factors affecting our aerospace businesses our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers, foreign manufacturers (whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial products) and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. in particular, pratt &amp; whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframe/engine combinations. engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements. customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services. in addition, the u.s. and other governments policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. significant elements of our aerospace businesses, such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service, have short lead times. therefore, backlog information may not be indicative of future demand. the operations of our aerospace businesses can also be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in other matters relating to our business as a whole in this section and in item 1a. risk factors of this form 10-k and in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our 2005 annual report. pratt &amp; whitney major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aircraft engines and rolls royce plc. for information regarding customer financing commitments, participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees, see notes 4 and 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2005 annual report. other utc power develops and markets distributed power generation systems, including stationary fuel cells and combined cooling, heating and power (cchp) systems, for the on-site power market. commercial building applications, light industrial businesses, institutions, office buildings and hotels use these on-site products. the cchp solutions for commercial buildings are marketed as the pure comfort product family. in 2004, we introduced the purecycle 200 product, which utilizes an organic rankine cycle to convert waste heat into energy. microturbines and organic rankine cycle devices are in an early stage of development and manufacturing. continued technology advancement and cost reduction are required for wide-scale market acceptance. utc fuel cells, a part of utc power, is a world leader in fuel cell production and development for commercial, transportation and space applications. utc fuel cells is the sole supplier of fuel cells for u.s. space missions and also offers a commercially available fuel cell power plant for on-site power applications, known as the purecell 200, which uses proven phosphoric acid fuel cell technology. in the transportation market, utc fuel cells is working with automotive and bus manufacturers, as well as the u.s. government, on development and demonstration programs for vehicles. in 2005, utc fuel cells provided puremotion 120 fuel cell power plants for buses intended for revenue service in california. utc power is actively pursuing further commercialization of these power plants. utc fuel cells is also providing fuel cells to hyundai motor corporation under the u.s. department of energy freedom car program. utc power continues to work closely with many of the major automobile manufacturers to advance the technology of hydrogen fuel cell powered cars. fuel cell power plants using proton exchange membrane technology (pem) are currently in development for transportation and on-site applications. although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of efficiency and environmental characteristics, the technology is still in development and current production rates remain low across the industry. continued technology advancement and cost reduction of key fuel cell components are required to achieve wide-scale market acceptance. government support is needed to advance fuel cell technology to a truly commercial stage. there is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable pem fuel cells will be produced. the results of utc power are included in the eliminations and other category in the segment financial data in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2005 annual report. 5 table of contents other matters relating to our business as a whole research and development since changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position, we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development. these expenditures, which are charged to expense as incurred, were $1,367 million, or 3.2 percent of total sales in 2005, as compared with $1,267 million or 3.5 percent of total sales in 2004 and $1,040 million or 3.4 percent of total sales in 2003. we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the u.s. government and other customers. this contract research and development, which is performed principally in the pratt &amp; whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky segments, amounted to $1,498 million in 2005, as compared with $1,619 million in 2004 and $1,580 million in 2003. u.s. government contracts u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. in the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. most of our u.s. government sales are made under fixed-price type contracts; approximately $2 billion of our total sales for 2005 were made under cost-reimbursement type contracts. our contracts with the u.s. government are also subject to audits. like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports from the u.s. government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations. some of these audit reports have involved substantial amounts. we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and we continue to litigate certain cases. for further discussion of risks related to government contracting, see the discussion in item 1a. risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10-k and note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2005 annual report for further discussion. compliance with environmental and other government regulations our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. (environmental matters are further addressed in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 1 and 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2005 annual report.) most of the u.s. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any u.s. government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected. we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations. for example, governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards, elevator safety codes and fire safety regulations are important to the businesses of carrier, otis and utc f&amp;s respectively, while government safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses. intellectual property and raw materials we maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. while this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business, we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our operating segments. we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials, components, services and supplies used in our manufacturing. we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs. we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating our purchases, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers. in some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers. like other users in the u.s., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as 6 table of contents cobalt (africa, australia and russia), tantalum (australia and asia), chromium (africa and kazakhstan) and rhenium (chile and kazakhstan). we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. although recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses (steel, copper, aluminum), have caused margin and cost pressures, we do not foresee any near term unavailability of materials, components or supplies that would have an adverse effect on our business, or on any of our business segments. for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business, see item ia. risk factors in this form 10-k. employees and employee relations at december 31, 2005, our total employment was approximately 222,200, approximately 67 percent of which represents employees based outside the united states. during 2005, we renegotiated multi-year collective bargaining agreements covering certain workers at carrier and otis. in 2006, collective bargaining agreements covering certain workers at sikorsky and carrier are subject to renegotiation. for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment, see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2005 annual report. for a discussion of other matters which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including the risks of our international operations, see the further discussion under the headings general and description of business by segment in this section and item 1a. risk factors in this form 10-k and in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2005 annual report. item 1a. risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see the discussion in other matters relating to our business as a whole and cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results in this form 10-k and in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2005 annual report. our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the aerospace and construction industries the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated 36 percent of our revenues in 2005, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries. the aviation industry is cyclical, and capital spending by airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits and backlog levels. also, since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2006, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending and u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, regulatory changes, the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines that increase reliability. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations. the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated 64 percent of our revenues in 2005, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs and other global and political factors. in addition to these factors, carrier financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, in its residential business, weather conditions in seasonal periods. our business may be affected by government contracting risks u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. if terminated by the government as a result of 7 table of contents our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more u.s. government investigations. if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any u.s. government investigations (including violation of certain environmental or export laws), we could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages. any contracts found to be tainted by fraud could be voided by the u.s. government. the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. debarment generally does not exceed three years. independently, failure to comply with u.s. laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the u.s. could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulation we conduct our business on a global basis, with 61 percent of our total 2005 segment revenues, including u.s. export sales, derived from operations outside of the united states. fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand in export markets and affect reported profits of our non-u.s. operations (primarily the commercial businesses) where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements on non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our revenues are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or to the awarding of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china russia and south africa, which carry high levels of currency, political and economic risk. while these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. we use a variety of raw materials in our businesses, and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products our reliance on foreign suppliers and commodity markets to secure raw materials used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of raw materials. in some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. we engage in acquisitions, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and may continue to do so in the future. the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions, apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, and cooperate with our strategic partners. we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, and in managing strategic investments. furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 8 table of contents we are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our operating results our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. as required by gaap, we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. for a description of current legal proceedings, see item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10-k. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 14 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information concerning market risk sensitive instruments, see discussion under the headings market risk and risk

financial statements in our 2005 annual report.risk factors 8 risk factors and in cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results in this form 10-k. each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the united states and other countries, and each competes on the basis of price, delivery schedule, product performance and service. our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers, foreign manufacturers (whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial products) and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. in particular, pratt &amp; whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframe/engine combinations. engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements. customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services. in addition, the u.s. and other governments policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. significant elements of our aerospace businesses, such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service, have short lead times. therefore, backlog information may not be indicative of future demand. pratt &amp; whitney major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation and rolls royce plc. for information regarding customer financing commitments, participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees, see notes 4 and 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2006 annual report. research and development since changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position, we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development. these expenditures, which are charged to expense as incurred, were $1,529 million, or 3.2 percent of total sales in 2006, as compared with $1,367 million or 3.2 percent of total - 5 - table of contents sales in 2005 and $1,267 million or 3.5 percent of total sales in 2004. we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the u.s. government and other customers. this contract research and development, which is performed principally in the pratt &amp; whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky segments, amounted to $1,952 million in 2006, as compared with $1,650 million in 2005 and $1,619 million in 2004. these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred, through cost of products sold, and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production aircraft shipments. of the totals, $1,621 million, $1,478 million and $1,585 million were expensed in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the remaining costs have been capitalized. u.s. government contracts u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. in the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. most of our u.s. government sales are made under fixed-price type contracts, while approximately $2.1 billion of our total sales for 2006 were made under cost-reimbursement type contracts. our contracts with the u.s. government are also subject to audits. like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports from the u.s. government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations. some of these audit reports have involved substantial amounts. we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and we continue to litigate certain cases. for further discussion of risks related to government contracting, see the discussion in item 1a, risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10-k and note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2006 annual report for further discussion. compliance with environmental and other government regulations our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the

business, see item 1a. risk factors in this form 10-k. employees and employee relations at december 31, 2006, our total employment was approximately 214,500, approximately 66 percent of which represents employees based outside the united states. during 2006, we renegotiated twenty multi-year collective bargaining agreements, the largest of which covered certain workers at sikorsky and carrier. in 2007, numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation, the largest of which cover certain workers at hamilton sundstrand, otis and pratt &amp; whitney. we do not anticipate any problems in renegotiating these contracts that would either individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. for

to these factors is included in our 2006 annual report in the section titled management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . item 1a. risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to

on the conditions of the aerospace and construction industries the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated 37 percent of our revenues in 2006, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries. the aviation industry is cyclical, and capital spending by airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits and backlog levels. also, since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2007, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending and u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, regulatory changes, the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines that increase reliability. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations. the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated 63 percent of our revenues in 2006, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs and other global and political factors. in addition to these factors, carrier financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, in its residential business, weather conditions. our business may be affected by government contracting risks u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more u.s. government investigations. if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any u.s. government investigations (including violation of certain environmental or export laws), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages. the u.s. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. debarment generally does not exceed three years. independently, failure to comply with u.s. laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the u.s. could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges. - 8 - table of contents our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulation we conduct our business on a global basis, with 60 percent of our total 2006 segment revenues derived from operations outside of the united states and from u.s. export sales. fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand in export markets and affect reported profits of our non-u.s. operations (primarily the commercial businesses) where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements on non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our revenues are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, russia and south africa, that carry high levels of currency, political and economic risk. while these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier provided parts, components, sub-systems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products our reliance on suppliers, third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. we engage in acquisitions, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and may continue to do so in the future. the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions, apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, and cooperate with our strategic partners. we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, and in managing strategic investments. furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. - 9 - table of contents we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. we regularly invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of internal and supplier produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; achieving cost and production efficiencies and validation of innovative technologies. these factors involve significant risks and uncertainties. we may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities pratt &amp; whitney or its affiliates will produce aircraft engines currently in development or pending required certifications. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, litigation concerning product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters, compliance with competition laws and sales and trading practices. while we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. as required by generally

note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2006 annual report.risk factors 8 risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see the discussion in other matters relating to our business as a whole and cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results in this form 10-k and in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2007 annual report. our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the aerospace and construction industries the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 37 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries. the aerospace industry is cyclical, and capital spending by airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits, corporate profitability and backlog levels. also, since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2008, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. at times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending and u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, regulatory changes, the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines that increase reliability. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations. the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 63 percent of our revenues in 2007, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs and other global and political factors. in addition to these factors, carrier financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, in its residential business, weather conditions. our business may be affected by government contracting risks u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more u.s. government investigations. if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any u.s. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages. the u.s. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. debarment generally does not exceed three years. independently, failure to comply with u.s. laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the united states could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulation we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 62 percent of our total 2007 segment revenues derived from operations outside of the united states and from u.s. export sales. fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand in export markets and affect reported profits of our non-u.s. operations (primarily the commercial businesses) where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our revenues are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. 8 table of contents the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses is transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the united states is incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro and the canadian dollar). for differences between u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage this exposure, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar revenues. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, russia and south africa that carry high levels of currency, political and economic risk. while these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products our reliance on suppliers, third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in the manufacturing of our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. we engage in acquisitions, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and may continue to do so in the future. the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions, apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, and cooperate with our strategic partners. we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, and in managing strategic investments. furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. we regularly invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of internal and supplier-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; achieving cost and production efficiencies, validation of innovative technologies and the level of customer interest in new technologies and products. these factors involve significant - 9 - table of contents risks and uncertainties. we may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities pratt &amp; whitney or its affiliates will produce aircraft engines currently in development or pending required certifications. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, litigation concerning product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign export laws, competition laws and sales and trading practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such litigation. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts. independently, failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges. while we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. as required by generally accepted accounting principles, we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. if there is a range of estimates and no amount within that range is more likely to occur than another, then we accrue the minimum amount. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. for a description of current legal proceedings, see part i, item 3, legal proceedings, in this form 10-k. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 14 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information concerning market risk

report. our global growth is subject to a number of economic risks as widely reported, financial markets in the united states, europe and asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions that include severely restricted credit and declines in real estate values. while currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies. these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. the current tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. similarly, this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, financial strength of airline customers and government procurement. strengthening of the rate of exchange for the u.s. dollar against certain major currencies such as the euro, the canadian dollar and other currencies also adversely affects our results. we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the u.s. and other countries. 10 table of contents our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 62 percent of our revenues in 2008, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, the tightening of the u.s. credit markets and other global and political factors. in addition to these factors, carrier financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, in its residential business, weather conditions. the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 38 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. the challenging operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines is expected to continue. as a result, capital spending by commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, worldwide airline profits, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, and backlog levels, all of which could reduce both the demand for air travel and the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace businesses aftermarket sales and margins. also, since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2009, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. at

criminal or other seriously improper conduct. debarment generally does not exceed three years. independently, failure to comply with u.s. laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the united states could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges. in addition, we are also sensitive to u.s. military budgets, which may fluctuate to reflect the policies of a new administration or congress. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulation we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 64 percent of our total 2008 segment revenues derived from operations outside of the united states and from u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (primarily the commercial businesses) where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency 11 table of contents fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, our operating margins may also be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for cross border transactions. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our revenues are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses is transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the united states is incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro and the canadian dollar). for operating units with u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar revenues. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. our international sales

no. 141 (revised 2007), business combinations, which, among other things, requires companies to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. 12 table of contents we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of

to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, litigation concerning product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign export laws, competition laws and sales and trading practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such litigation. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts. independently, failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges. while we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. for non-income tax risks, we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. for a description of current legal proceedings, see part i, item 3, legal proceedings, in this form 10-k. for income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts. for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50% likelihood that such tax benefit will be sustained, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements. subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previously-recognized benefit which could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such event occurs or on our cash flows in the period in which the ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority occurs. 13 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 17 quantitative and qualitative

throughout 2009, including widespread recessionary conditions, record levels of unemployment, significant distress of financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address extreme financial and economic conditions that include severely restricted credit and declines in real estate values. in recent months, certain indices and economic data have begun to show first signs of improvement and stabilization in the macroeconomic environment. however, there can be no assurance that these improvements will be broad-based and sustainable, or that they will affect markets relevant to us. further, there can be no assurance that we will not experience further adverse effects that may be material to our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and ability to access capital.

the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. debarment generally does not exceed three years. independently, failure to comply with u.s. laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the united states could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges. in addition, we are also sensitive to u.s. military budgets, which may fluctuate to reflect the policies of a new administration or congress. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulation we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 59% of our total 2009 segment revenues derived from operations outside of the united states and from u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (primarily the commercial businesses) where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, our operating margins may also be negatively impacted by worldwide 11 table of contents currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our revenues are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the united states are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro and the canadian dollar). for operating units with u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar revenues. see note 1 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, russia, south africa and countries in the middle east, that carry high levels of currency, political and economic risk. we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. emerging market operations can present many risks, including civil disturbances, health concerns, cultural differences, such as employment and business practices, volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls. while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products our reliance on suppliers, third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. we engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and may continue to do so in the future. the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in connection with these transactions, apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, and cooperate with our strategic partners. we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, or in managing strategic investments. additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, the recent effectiveness of revisions to accounting for business combinations, which, among other things, require companies to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. these divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results. we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. we regularly invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue 12 table of contents advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of internal and supplier-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; achieving cost and production efficiencies, validation of innovative technologies and the level of customer interest in new technologies and products. these factors involve significant risks and uncertainties. we or our suppliers and subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses, particularly pratt &amp; whitney, sikorsky and hamilton sundstrand, will produce aircraft engines, helicopters, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we are subject to litigation, tax, environmental and other legal compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of litigation tax and legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, litigation concerning product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign export laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such litigation. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts. independently, failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges. as a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. they may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. changes in laws and regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws and regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental laws and regulations could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. in the area of tax, changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. in addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded. while we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. for non-income tax risks, we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. for a description of current legal proceedings, see part i, item 3 legal proceedings, in this form 10-k. for income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts. for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50% likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements. subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previously-recognized benefit which could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such event occurs or on our cash flows in the period in which the ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority occurs. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 16 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for

operations in our 2009 annual report and under the heading foreign exchange and hedging activity in note 1 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 annual report.risk factors 10 risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see the discussion in the business section under the headings other matters relating to our business as a whole and cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results in this form 10-k and in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2010 annual report. our global growth is subject to a number of economic risks the global economy, which experienced a significant downturn throughout 2008 and 2009, including widespread recessionary conditions, record levels of unemployment, significant distress of financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, began showing signs of gradual improvement in 2010. however, while some economic indicators trended positively, the overall rate of global recovery experienced during the course of 2010 has been uneven and uncertainty continues to exist over the stability of the recovery. global gross domestic product growth in 2010 was led by emerging markets. in the developed economies, particularly in europe, where the recovery is sluggish, the unwinding of fiscal stimuli and lingering high unemployment have encouraged the use of expansionary monetary policies to sustain economic recoveries. although consumer confidence in the u.s. has improved since the economic downturn, it still remains low, while unemployment remains high and the housing market remains depressed. there can be 10 table of contents no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad based and sustainable, or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. further, there can be no assurance that we will not experience further adverse effects that may be material to our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition, results of operations, or our ability to access capital. while these economic developments have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations to date, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies. these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. similarly, this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airline customers and business jet operators, and government procurement. strengthening of the rate of exchange for the u.s. dollar against certain major currencies such as the euro, the canadian dollar and other currencies also adversely affects our results. our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 57% of our consolidated net sales in 2010, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, the tightening of the u.s. credit markets and other global and political factors. a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely impact carrier business. in addition to these factors, carrier financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, in its residential business, weather conditions. the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 43% of our consolidated net sales in 2010, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown signs of gradual improvement in 2010, uncertainty continues to exist. as a result, financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, of one or more of the major commercial airlines could result in significant cancellations of orders, reductions in our aerospace sales and losses under existing contracts. in addition, capital spending and demand for aircraft engine and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, worldwide airline profits, airline consolidation, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, and backlog levels, all of which could reduce both the demand for air travel and the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace businesses aftermarket sales and margins. also, since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2011, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. at times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending and u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. our business may be affected by government contracting risks u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more u.s. government investigations relating to certain of our u.s. government contracts. if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any u.s. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages. the u.s. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. debarment generally does not exceed three years. independently, failure to comply with u.s. laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the united states could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges. in addition, we are also sensitive to u.s. military budgets, which may fluctuate to reflect the policies of a new administration or congress. 11 table of contents our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations, economic conditions and changes in local government regulation we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 60% of our total 2010 segment sales derived from international operations, including u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (primarily the commercial businesses) where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay

to manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar sales. see note 1 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2010 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks

health concerns, cultural differences, such as employment and business practices, volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls. while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and

allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. 12 table of contents we engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions, in addition to internal growth. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and may continue to do so in the future. the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in connection with these transactions, apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, and cooperate with our strategic partners. however, our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target previous activities. we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, or in managing strategic investments. additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. these divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on us and could affect our future financial results. we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. the product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier- and internally-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products, and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop. these factors involve significant risks and uncertainties. any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. in addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. we or our suppliers and subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, helicopters, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications. our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the services. to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products. the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse affect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. we are subject to litigation, tax, environmental and other legal compliance risks we are subject to a variety of litigation, tax and legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign export laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts. independently, failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges. as a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. they may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. 13 table of contents in the area of taxes, changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. in addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded. the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. for non-income tax risks, we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. for a description of current legal proceedings, see part i, item 3 legal proceedings, in this form 10-k. for income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts. for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50% likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements. subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previously-recognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the period in which such event occurs or on our cash flows in the period in which the ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority occurs. we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected in order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings. we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated costs reductions or may otherwise harm our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. we depend on our intellectual property, and infringement or failure to protect intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. in addition, our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the united states, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 17 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market

table of contentsrisk factors 11 risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. our global growth is subject to a number of economic risks in 2011, the global economy improved as compared to 2010 and continued to show signs of a gradual recovery from the significant downturn of 2008 and 2009 when the global economy experienced widespread recessionary conditions, record levels of unemployment, significant distress of financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. however, despite positive economic indicators seen in the beginning of 2011, uncertainty continues to exist as to the overall rate and stability of the recovery. global gross domestic product growth continues to be led by emerging markets, particularly in brazil, russia, india and china, while in the developed economies, particularly in europe, the recovery remains uncertain due to persistent high unemployment in the u.s. and europe, a weak u.s. and european housing market, government budget reduction plans the unwinding of fiscal stimuli and concerns over the deepening european sovereign debt crisis. as a result, further disruptions in europe or in other economies could affect our sales or liquidity. 11 table of contents although consumer confidence in the u.s. has improved since the economic downturn, it still remains low, while, as mentioned above, unemployment remains high and the housing market remains depressed. there can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad-based and sustainable, or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. further, there can be no assurance that we will not experience further adverse effects that may be material to our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition, results of operations, or our ability to access capital. while these economic developments have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations to date, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies. these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. similarly, this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. strengthening of the rate of exchange for the u.s. dollar against certain major currencies such as the euro, the canadian dollar and other currencies also adversely affects our results, as the majority of our sales are non-u.s. based. our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 58 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, the tightening of global credit markets and other global and political factors. for example, a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect carrier business. in addition to these factors, carrier financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business, weather conditions. the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 42 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown signs of gradual improvement in 2011, uncertainty continues to exist. as a result, financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, of one or more of the major commercial airlines could result in significant cancellations of orders, reductions in our aerospace sales and losses under existing contracts. in addition, capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, worldwide airline profits, airline consolidation, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, and backlog levels, all of which could reduce the demand for air travel and the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace businesses aftermarket sales and margins. also, since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2012, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. at times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending and u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business may be affected by government contracting risks u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more u.s. government investigations relating to certain of our u.s. government contracts. if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any u.s. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages, and bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of u.s. government contracts. the u.s. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. debarment 12 table of contents generally does not exceed three years. independently, failure to comply with u.s. laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the united states could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges. in addition, we are also sensitive to u.s. military budgets, which may fluctuate based on the policies of a new administration or congress. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations, economic conditions and changes in local government regulation we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 61 percent of our total 2011 segment sales derived from international operations, including u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (primarily the commercial businesses), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, our operating margins may also be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our sales are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the united states are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro, the canadian dollar, and the polish zloty). for operating units with u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar sales. see note 1 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2011 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, mexico, russia, south africa and countries in the middle east, that carry high levels of currency, political and economic risk. we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. emerging market operations can present many risks, including civil disturbances, health concerns, cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls. while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products our reliance on suppliers, third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 13 table of contents we engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and expect to do so in the future. for example, on september 21, 2011, we announced an agreement to acquire goodrich and on october 12, 2011, pratt &amp; whitney announced that rolls-royce will sell its interests in iae to pratt &amp; whitney. further, on october 12, 2011 pratt &amp; whitney and rolls-royce also announced an agreement to form a new joint venture to develop new engines to power the next generation of 120 to 230 passenger mid-size aircraft that will replace the existing fleet of mid-size aircraft currently in service or in development. our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target previous activities. we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, or in managing strategic investments. additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. in addition, the success of our pending acquisition of goodrich and pratt &amp; whitney recently announced transactions with rolls-royce plc will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the proposed transactions, the timing of consummation of the proposed transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure regulatory approvals, and in the case of the goodrich transaction, the approval of goodrich shareholders, in a timely manner. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. these divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on us and could affect our future financial results. we may not complete the goodrich acquisition or complete the acquisition within the time frame we anticipate; the acquired business may underperform relative to our expectations; the transaction may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community; we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated synergies. the goodrich acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions, as described above, and the completion of the transaction is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. the unpredictability of the business and regulatory conditions affecting the industries in which we and goodrich operate, the uncertainty of regulatory approvals, the requirement that the merger agreement be adopted by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of goodrich common stock, and other risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our ability to complete the acquisition or complete the acquisition within the time frame we anticipate. in addition, if the acquisition is consummated, the success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from the integration of goodrich with our existing businesses. the integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of goodrich and realizing our expectations for the acquisition include, among others: failure to implement our business plan for the combined business; unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems; unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators; retaining key customers, suppliers and employees; retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; operating risks inherent in the goodrich business and our business; the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; and other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. 14 table of contents we have outstanding debt and we will incur significant transaction- and acquisition-related costs in connection with financing the acquisition of goodrich; our debt will increase as a result of the acquisition and any incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the acquisition, and will increase if we incur additional debt in the future and do not retire existing debt. we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. as of december 31, 2011, we had approximately $10.3 billion of total debt on a consolidated basis. we anticipate that goodrich will have approximately $1.9 billion of net debt as of the closing of the acquisition of goodrich, and we further anticipate incurring significant additional debt in connection with the financing of the acquisition. our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions; reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. we may incur significantly more debt in the future. if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. our current global and domestic revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on us, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets. our current revolving credit facilities are available for general corporate purposes. there are currently no amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. the product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier- and internally-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop. these factors involve significant risks and uncertainties. any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. in addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. we or our suppliers and subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, helicopters, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications. our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we are subject to litigation, tax, environmental and other legal compliance risks we are subject to a variety of litigation, tax and legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign export laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts. independently, failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges. as a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. they may also change from time to time, as may related 15 table of contents interpretations and other guidance. changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. in the area of taxes, changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. in addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing investigations could be expanded. the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. for non-income tax risks, we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. for a description of current legal proceedings, see part i, item 3 legal proceedings, in this form 10-k. for income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts. for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 percent likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements. subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previously-recognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the period in which any such event occurs or on our cash flows in the period in which the ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority occurs. we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected in order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings. we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business disruptions our business may be impacted by disruptions, including information technology attacks or failures, threats to physical security, as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. we depend on our intellectual property, and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. we also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents 16 table of contents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. in addition, our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the united states, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. we may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures. cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency. any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 20 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information concerning market risk sensitive instruments, see discussion under the heading market risk and risk management in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2011 annual report and under the heading foreign exchange and hedging activity in note 1 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2011 annual report.risk factors 12 risk factors our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. our global growth is subject to a number of economic risks. over the past few years, market and economic conditions in the u.s. and globally have been highly challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth. the u.s. economy has experienced a recession and faces continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions such as the growing u.s. deficit, high energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and an unstable real estate market. in 2012, the global economy improved as compared to 2011 and continued to show signs of a gradual recovery from the significant downturn of 2008 and 2009 when the global economy experienced widespread recessionary conditions, record levels of unemployment, significant distress of financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. however, despite positive economic indicators seen since the beginning of 2011, uncertainty continues to exist as to the overall rate and stability of the recovery. despite a recent slowdown in growth rates in china and other emerging economies, global gross domestic product growth continues to be led by emerging markets, particularly brazil, russia, india and china. in the developed economies, particularly in europe, recovery remains uncertain due to persistent high unemployment in the u.s. and europe, a slow recovery of the u.s. and european housing markets, government budget reduction plans, the unwinding of fiscal stimuli, and concerns over the continuing european sovereign debt crisis. further disruptions in europe or in other economies could affect our sales or liquidity. although consumer confidence in the u.s. has improved since the economic downturn, it still remains low, while, as mentioned above, unemployment remains high and the housing market remains depressed. there can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad-based and sustainable, or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. further, there can be no assurance that we will not experience further adverse effects that may be material to our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition, results of operations, or our ability to access capital. while these economic developments have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations to date, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies. these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. similarly, this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. strengthening of the rate of exchange for the u.s. dollar against certain major currencies such as the euro, the canadian dollar and other currencies also adversely affects our results, as the majority of our sales are non-u.s. based. 12 table of contents our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. the results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 51 percent of our consolidated sales in 2012, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, the tightening of global credit markets and other global and political factors. for example, a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate, controls &amp; security. in addition, the financial performance of utc climate, controls &amp; security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business, weather conditions. the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 49 percent of our consolidated sales in 2012, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown signs of gradual improvement since 2011, uncertainty continues to exist. as a result, financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, of one or more of the major commercial airlines could result in significant cancellations of orders, reductions in our aerospace sales and losses under existing contracts. in addition, capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, worldwide airline profits, airline consolidation, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, and backlog levels, all of which could also reduce the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. other factors, including future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could also dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel, which could negatively impact the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. additionally, because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2013, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. at times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program. in addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment, continued pressure on u.s. and global defense spending and u.s. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our business may be affected by government contracting risks. u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. if terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. we are now, and believe that in light of the current u.s. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more u.s. government investigations relating to certain of our u.s. government contracts. if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any u.s. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the u.s. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new u.s. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. if convicted or found liable, the u.s. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages, and bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of u.s. government contracts. the u.s. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. the u.s. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. debarment generally does not exceed three years. we are also sensitive to u.s. military budgets, which may be impacted by numerous economic and political factors and which may fluctuate based on the policies of the current administration or congress. in addition, the specific government programs in which we participate, or in which we may seek to participate in the future, compete with other programs for consideration during the budget formulation and appropriation processes. one or more of the programs that we currently support could be phased-out or terminated. reductions in these existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations, economic conditions and changes in local government regulation. we conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 60 percent of our 2012 consolidated sales derived from international operations, including u.s. export sales. changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-u.s. operations (primarily the commercial businesses), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay 13 table of contents suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, our operating margins may also be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-u.s. operating units are translated into u.s. dollars. given that the majority of our sales are non-u.s. based, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in u.s. dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the u.s. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the euro, the canadian dollar, and the polish zloty). for operating units with u.s. dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. to manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with u.s. dollar sales. see note 1 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2012 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies. our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. for example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. in addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including argentina, brazil, china, india, mexico, russia, south africa and countries in the middle east, that carry high levels of currency, political and economic risk. we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. emerging market operations can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls. while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses, and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. our reliance on suppliers, third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. in many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of divested businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures. we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. in the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and expect to do so in the future. for example, on june 29, 2012, pratt &amp; whitney acquired rolls-royce ownership and collaboration interests in iae, and on july 26, 2012, we completed our acquisition of goodrich. further, on october 12, 2011 pratt &amp; whitney and rolls-royce announced an agreement, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions, to form a new joint venture to develop new engines to power the next generation of 120 to 230 passenger mid-size aircraft that will replace the existing fleet of mid-size aircraft currently in service or in development. our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target previous activities. we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, or in 14 table of contents managing strategic investments. additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. for example, on december 13, 2012, we completed the sale of the legacy hamilton sundstrand industrial businesses to bc partners and the carlyle group. our divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on us and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. the acquired goodrich business may underperform relative to our expectations; the transaction may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community; we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated synergies. the success of the goodrich acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from the integration of goodrich with our existing businesses. the integration process is complex, costly and time-consuming. the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of goodrich and realizing our expectations for the acquisition include, among others: failure to implement our business plan for the combined business; unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems; unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; operating risks inherent in the goodrich business and our business; retaining key customers, suppliers and employees; retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators; and the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. our debt has increased as a result of the goodrich acquisition and will increase if we incur additional debt in the future and do not retire existing debt. we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. we have incurred substantial additional debt as a result of the goodrich acquisition. as of december 31, 2012, we had approximately $23.2 billion of total debt on a consolidated basis. our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including, among others: requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions; reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. we may incur significantly more debt in the future. if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. our global and domestic revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on us, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets. our revolving credit facilities are available for general corporate purposes. there are currently no amounts outstanding under these credit facilities. our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. 15 table of contents we design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. we seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. the product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier- and internally-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop. for example, certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers. these systems and end products may incorporate additional advanced technologies manufactured by third parties that involve additional risks and uncertainties. as a result, the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace. any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. in addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. we, or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. in particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, helicopters, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications. our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require a license from the u.s. department of state, the u.s. department of commerce or the u.s. department of the treasury. as an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the u.s. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. in the u.s., these laws include, among others, the u.s. export administration regulations (ear) administered by the u.s. department of commerce, bureau of industry and security, the international traffic in arms regulations (itar) administered by the u.s. department of state, directorate of defense trade controls (dtcc), and trade sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the u.s. department of treasury, office of foreign assets control. certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the itar, or represent so-called dual use items governed by the ear. as a result, these products require individual validated licenses in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions. any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties. as previously disclosed, on june 28, 2012 we entered into a consent agreement with the dtcc and a deferred prosecution agreement with the u.s. department of justice regarding separate but related export licensing compliance violations, both of which impose significant continuing obligations. any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products. the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we are subject to litigation, tax, environmental and other legal compliance risks. we are subject to a variety of litigation, tax and other legal compliance risks. these risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with u.s. and foreign laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. if convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). as a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. they may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to 16 table of contents new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. in the area of taxes, changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. in addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing investigations could be expanded. the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. for non-income tax risks, we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. for a description of current legal proceedings, see part i, item 3 legal proceedings, in this form 10-k. for income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts. for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 percent likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements. subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previously-recognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the period in which any such event occurs or on our cash flows in the period in which the ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority occurs. in addition, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-u.s. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. the fcpa applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. under the fcpa, u.s. companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded u.s. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. certain of our customer relationships outside of the u.s. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents. as a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected. in order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings. we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 17 table of contents our financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business disruptions. our business may be impacted by disruptions, including information technology attacks or failures, threats to physical security, as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. we depend on our intellectual property, and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. we also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. in addition, our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the u.s., which could have a negative impact on sales volume. we may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 22 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information concerning
