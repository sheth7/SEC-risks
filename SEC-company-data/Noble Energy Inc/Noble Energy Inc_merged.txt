(2) other international includes ecuador, china and argentina. oil and gas operating costs increased $29 million, or 11%, from 2006 to 2007. the increase is primarily the result of expanded operations in equatorial guinea and the north sea. oil and gas operating costs increased $66 million, or 33%, from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of our expanded operations. three new deepwater gulf of mexico development projects came online between december 2005 and april 2006. fiscal year 2006 represented a full year of patina operations, and we acquired u.s. exploration in 2006. in addition, the high commodity price environment resulted in higher service, contract labor and fuel costs. insurance costs were also higher in 2006 due in part to increased rates for property damage coverage combined with the added costs of providing business interruption coverage on deepwater gulf of mexico assets. workover and repair expense decreased $24 million during 2007 as compared with 2006. the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in hurricane-related repair expense, which totaled $30 million in 2006 and $1 million in 2007. workover and repair expense increased $33 million during 2006 as compared with 2005. expense for 2006 included $30 million ($0.45 per boe) of hurricane-related repair expense. 43 table of contents production and ad valorem tax expense increased $5 million, or 4%, during 2007 as compared with 2006 and increased $30 million, or 38%, during 2006 as compared with 2005. the increase reflects additional production from u.s. exploration and patina properties. these properties have proportionately more production subject to such taxes. transportation expense increased $23 million, or 81%, during 2007 as compared with 2006. the increase was due primarily due to changes in the terms of certain sales contracts for northern region production and increased production in the north sea. transportation expense increased $12 million, or 70%, during 2006 as compared with 2005. the increase was primarily due to a full year of patina operations and u.s. exploration. selected expenses on a per boe of sales volume basis were as follows: year ended december 31, 2007 2006 2005 oil and gas operating costs $ 4.29 $ 4.14 $ 3.94 workover and repair expense 0.33 0.72 0.27 lease operating costs 4.62 4.86 4.21 production and ad valorem taxes 1.63 1.67 1.52 transportation expense 0.74 0.44 0.33 total production costs (1) (2) $ 6.99 $ 6.97 $ 6.06 (1) consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and costs attributable to equity method investees. (2) sales volumes include natural gas sales to an lng facility in equatorial guinea that began late first quarter of 2007. the inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $0.51 per boe for 2007. the unit rates of total production costs per boe, converting gas to oil on the basis of six mcf per barrel, have been increasing year-over-year since 2005. the increases are due to rising third-party costs, including insurance, hurricane-related repair expense, and higher production taxes. 44 table of contents oil and gas exploration expense exploration expense was as follows: united west north other int'l/ total states africa sea israel corporate (1) (in thousands) year ended december 31, 2007 dry hole expense $ 90,210 $ 49,473 $ 40,399 $ 5 $ - $ 333 unproved lease amortization 16,013 15,176 - 103 - 734 seismic 64,856 55,258 939 8,184 691 (216 ) staff expense 45,030 11,900 2,106 8,318 645 22,061 other 2,973 2,423 100 340 82 28 total exploration expense $ 219,082 $ 134,230 $ 43,544 $ 16,950 $ 1,418 $ 22,940 year ended december 31, 2006 dry hole expense $ 70,325 $ 66,150 $ 46 $ 4,129 $ - $ - unproved lease amortization 18,836 18,823 - 13 - - seismic 37,676 29,320 4,204 685 3 3,464 staff expense 38,861 12,710 2,887 4,816 250 18,198 other 2,226 1,083 192 879 33 39 total exploration expense $ 167,924 $ 128,086 $ 7,329 $ 10,522 $ 286 $ 21,701 year ended december 31, 2005 dry hole expense $ 98,015 $ 95,678 $ 1,403 $ 932 $ 2 $ - unproved lease amortization 17,855 17,855 - - - - seismic 21,761 11,631 316 1,544 - 8,270 staff expense 34,945 16,255 3,760 2,690 189 12,051 other 5,850 4,974 (16 ) 819 32 41 total exploration expense $ 178,426 $ 146,393 $ 5,463 $ 5,985 $ 223 $ 20,362 (1) other international includes ecuador, china, argentina and surname. exploration expense increased $51 million, or 30% during 2007 as compared with 2006. us dry hole expense decreased $17 million due to a reduction in the number of dry holes drilled during 2007. dry hole expense increased $40 million in west africa and included amounts related to a dry exploratory well in equatorial guinea and expense related to a secondary target of an exploration well in cameroon in which commercial hydrocarbons were not found. seismic expense increased a net $27 million during 2007 as compared with 2006, primarily due to increases in us seismic expense incurred in support of the 2007 central gulf of mexico outer continental shelf sale. staff expense increased a net $6 million primarily due to new venture activity. exploration expense decreased $11 million, or 6% during 2006 as compared with 2005. us dry hole expense was $30 million less due to the reduction in the number of dry holes drilled. us seismic expense increased $18 million due primarily to the expansion of our deepwater gulf of mexico 3d seismic database. in addition, other international staff expense increased $6 million due to new venture activity. exploration expense included stock-based compensation expense of $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in 2006. 45 table of contents depreciation, depletion and amortization expense dd&amp;a expense was as follows: year ended december 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) united states $ 574,001 $ 543,431 $ 311,153 west africa 25,315 23,620 27,121 north sea 79,450 8,123 9,888 israel 17,842 13,947 11,188 other international, corporate, and other 31,373 33,487 31,194 total dd&amp;a expense $ 727,981 $ 622,608 $ 390,544 unit rate of dd&amp;a per boe (1) (2) $ 10.43 $ 9.54 $ 7.55 (1) consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and costs attributable to equity method investees.

(noble energy, we or us) is a delaware corporation, formed in 1969, that has been publicly traded on the new york stock exchange (nyse) since 1980. we are an independent energy company that has been engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, production and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (ngls) since 1932. in this report, unless otherwise indicated or where the context otherwise requires, information includes that of noble energy and its subsidiaries. we operate primarily in the rocky mountains, mid-continent, and deepwater gulf of mexico areas in the us, with key international operations offshore israel and west africa. our aim is to achieve growth in earnings and cash flow through exploration success and the finding and development of a high quality portfolio of assets that is balanced between us and international projects. exploration success, along with additional capital investment, in us and international locations such as equatorial guinea and israel, have resulted in substantial growth in the last several years. in addition, occasional strategic acquisitions such as patina oil &amp; gas corporation (patina) in 2005 and u.s. exploration holdings, inc. (u.s. exploration) in 2006, combined with the sale of non-core assets, have allowed us to achieve a strategic objective of enhancing our asset portfolio, resulting in a company with assets and capabilities that include major us basins coupled with a significant portfolio of international properties. see item 6. selected financial data for additional financial and operating information for fiscal years 2005-2009. in the current commodity and economic environment, our focus has remained on positioning noble energy for the future. in january 2009, we announced a significant discovery at tamar, offshore israel, the largest discovery in our history. also during 2009, we made substantial progress on our significant portfolio of long-term growth projects, including the sanctioning of the oil development projects at aseng (formerly benita) offshore equatorial guinea and at isabela/santa cruz (which we refer to collectively as galapagos) in the deepwater gulf of mexico, as well as making important progress on our plans for the tamar discovery. these and other major development projects typically offer long life, sustained cash flows after investment and attractive financial returns. we also have significant remaining exploration potential, primarily in the deepwater gulf of mexico and offshore west africa and israel. major development project inventory our exploration success has provided us with a number of significant development projects on which we are moving forward. these projects will require significant capital investments over the next several years. our major projects include the following: galapagos (deepwater gulf of mexico); aseng (offshore west africa); tamar (offshore israel); gunflint (deepwater gulf of mexico); belinda (offshore west africa); and diega/carmen (offshore west africa). these projects are discussed in more detail in the sections below. see also item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

reserves reporting requirements. we adopted the new rules as of december 31, 2009. see proved reserves disclosures, below, for additional disclosures provided in accordance with the sec's rules for modernization of oil and gas reporting and item 8. financial statements and supplementary data supplemental oil and gas information (unaudited) for definitions of proved oil and gas reserves, proved developed oil and gas reserves and proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves. crude oil and natural gas properties and activities we search for crude oil and natural gas properties, seek to acquire exploration rights in areas of interest and conduct exploratory activities. these activities include geophysical and geological evaluation and exploratory drilling, where appropriate, on properties for which we have acquired exploration rights. our properties consist primarily of interests in developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas leases and concessions. we also own natural gas processing plants and natural gas gathering and other crude oil and natural gas related pipeline systems which are primarily used in the processing and transportation of our crude oil, natural gas and ngl production. exploration activities we primarily focus on organic growth from exploration and development drilling, concentrating on basins or plays where we have strategic competitive advantage and which we believe offer superior returns. we have had substantial exploration success in the deepwater gulf of mexico, west africa and the eastern mediterranean resulting in a significant portfolio of major development projects. we have a numerous exploration opportunities remaining in these areas and are engaged in new venture activity in other international locations as well. appraisal, development and exploitation activities we assess our exploration successes for potential development as demonstrated in our growing inventory of major projects. in 2009, we sanctioned the isabela and aseng projects and are progressing toward sanctioning the tamar, belinda and gunflint projects during 2010 and/or 2011.we support a significant portion of the capital needs of these major projects with our long-lived inventory of low-risk development and exploitation projects. low-risk development and exploitation projects, such as the wattenberg field in our north america operations, also provide diversification and balance to our worldwide portfolio. acquisition and divestiture activities we maintain an ongoing portfolio optimization program. accordingly, we may engage in acquisitions of additional crude oil or natural gas properties and related assets through either direct acquisitions of the assets or acquisitions of entities owning the assets. we may also divest non-core assets in order to optimize our property portfolio. pending asset acquisition in january 2010, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the us rocky mountain assets of petro-canada resources (usa) inc. and suncor energy (natural gas) america inc. for $494 million. we estimate total proved reserves to be 53 mmboe, 45% of which are liquids and 80% are within the liquid-rich wattenberg field, where our largest onshore us asset is located. the acquisition will add approximately 10 mboepd, or 46 mmcf of natural gas and 2.5 mbbls of liquids to our daily production base, starting from the closing date, for 2010 and will provide significant growth potential. included in the purchase are 340,000 total net acres, nearly 200,000 of which are located in the greater denver-julesberg (dj) basin. the acquisition is expected to close late in the first quarter 2010 and is subject to customary closing conditions. see united states - northern region discussion below. 3 table of contents mid-continent acquisition in 2008, we acquired producing properties in western oklahoma for $292 million. properties acquired cover approximately 15,500 net acres. the total purchase price was allocated to the proved and unproved properties acquired based on fair values at the acquisition date. approximately $254 million was allocated to proved properties and $38 million to unproved properties. sale of argentina assets in 2008, we closed on the sale of our producing property interest in argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million, effective july 1, 2007. the $24 million gain on sale was deferred until 2009 when approval was obtained from the argentine government. our crude oil reserves for argentina totaled 7 mmbbls at december 31, 2007. sale of gulf of mexico shelf properties in 2006, we sold all of our significant gulf of mexico shelf properties except for the main pass area, which required repairs related to hurricane damage at the time. as of the effective date of the sale, proved reserves for the gulf of mexico properties sold totaled approximately 7 mmbbls of crude oil and 110 bcf of natural gas. the deepwater gulf of mexico remains a core area and is more aligned with our long-term business strategies. u.s. exploration acquisition in 2006, we acquired u.s. exploration, a privately held corporation, for $412 million plus liabilities assumed. u.s. exploration's reserves and production were located primarily in colorado's wattenberg field. this acquisition significantly expanded our operations in one of our core areas. proved reserves of u.s. exploration at the time of acquisition were approximately 234 bcfe, of which 38% were proved developed and 55% natural gas. proved crude oil and natural gas properties were valued at $413 million and unproved properties were valued at $131 million. in addition, we recorded $34 million of goodwill. patina merger in 2005, we acquired patina through merger (patina merger) for a total purchase price of $4.9 billion. patina's long-lived crude oil and natural gas reserves provided a significant inventory of low-risk opportunities that balanced our portfolio. patina's proved reserves at the time of acquisition were estimated to be approximately 1.6 tcfe, of which 72% were proved developed and 67% natural gas. proved crude oil and natural gas properties were valued at $2.6 billion and unproved properties were valued at $1.1 billion. in addition, we recorded $875 million of goodwill. united states we have been engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities throughout onshore us since 1932 and in the gulf of mexico since 1968. the patina merger and the acquisition of u.s. exploration significantly increased the breadth of our onshore operations, especially in the rocky mountains and mid-continent areas. these two acquisitions, along with other acquisitions of producing and non-producing properties, have provided us with a multi-year inventory of exploitation and development opportunities. we expect to close on a purchase of additional us rocky mountain assets in first quarter 2010, which will further increase our operations and project inventory in this area. in 2009, we were awarded 22 new leases in the deepwater gulf of mexico. us operations accounted for 56% of our 2009 consolidated sales volumes and 56% of total proved reserves at december 31, 2009. approximately 55% of the proved reserves are natural gas and 45% are crude oil, condensate and ngls. our onshore us portfolio at december 31, 2009 included 956,000 net developed acres and 1.3 million net undeveloped acres. we currently hold interests in 103 offshore blocks in the gulf of mexico. sales of production and estimates of

gulf of mexico 2 11 other 32 1,180 total 34 1,191 total united states 634 14,044 locations of our us onshore operations in the wattenberg field, mid-continent area and other significant areas are shown on the map below: northern region the northern region consists of our operations in the rocky mountain area, which includes the dj (wattenberg field), piceance, san juan, and wind river basins, as well as the niobrara (tri-state) and bowdoin fields. the rocky mountain area is one of our core operating assets. the northern region also includes the mid-continent area, consisting of properties in the texas panhandle, oklahoma and kansas. wattenberg field the wattenberg field (approximately 96% operated working interest), located in the dj basin of north central colorado, is our largest onshore us field and continues to grow. we acquired working interests in the wattenberg field through the patina merger in 2005 and acquisition of u.s. exploration in 2006. the wattenberg field held 57% of our us proved reserves at december 31, 2009. one of the most attractive features of the field is the presence of multiple productive formations, which include the codell, niobrara, and j-sand formations, as well as the d-sand, dakota and the shallower shannon, sussex and parkman formations. drilling in the wattenberg field is considered lower risk from the perspective of finding crude oil and natural gas reserves. 5 table of contents our current field activities are focused primarily on the improved recovery of reserves through drilling new wells or deepening within existing wellbores, recompleting the codell formation within existing j-sand wells, refracturing or trifracturing existing codell wells and refracturing or recompleting the niobrara formation within existing codell wells. a refracture consists of the restimulation of a producing formation within an existing wellbore to enhance production and add incremental reserves. a trifracture is effectively a refracture of a refracture. these projects and continued success with our production enhancement program, which includes well workovers, reactivations, and commingling of zones, allow us to increase production and add proved reserves to what is considered a mature field. due to economic conditions, our 2009 program decreased from 2008 levels. in 2009, we drilled or participated in 424 gross wattenberg field development wells, with a 100% success rate. three of these wells were horizontal wells targeting the niobrara formation. we added approximately 36 mmboe of proved reserves, approximately 49% of which were natural gas. at year-end, we were running five drilling rigs and 17 completion units in the field. we have experienced significant growth in production from the wattenberg field, from an average of 33 mboepd at year-end 2005 to approximately 45 mboepd for fourth quarter 2009. expansion of field boundaries has resulted in a large increase in our crude oil and ngl stream since year-end 2005. as a result, year-end 2009 production included approximately 20 mbpd of liquids. sales of wattenberg field production accounted for 41% of total us sales volumes in 2009. the infrastructure in this area is improving and expanding. oil transport alternatives improved in 2009 with the start up of a new interstate crude oil transportation pipeline system running from weld county, colorado, where the wattenberg field is located, to cushing, oklahoma. the pipeline, in which we own a small equity interest, provides another option for the marketing of our crude oil. we have a five-year throughput agreement with the pipeline. we continue to acquire acreage in the area and held interests in approximately 350,000 net acres at year-end 2009. we are planning an active capital program in 2010 and expect to increase the program from 2009 levels, drilling approximately 500 wells, with continued focus on new wells in the codell/niobrara formations. we will have the flexibility with short-term drilling rig contracts to decrease activity if economic conditions decline. additionally, we have a substantial project inventory remaining and plan to continue steady refracture, trifracture, and recompletion programs in 2010. as discussed under acquisition and divestiture activities pending asset acquisition above, we expect to close on an acquisition of additional us rocky mountain assets late in the first quarter 2010. we have identified several thousand projects associated with the assets being acquired, including over 2,000 codell/niobrara drilling locations in wattenberg. we plan to add two rigs to our wattenberg program in 2010 as a result of the transaction. we expect this activity to grow net production, with a focus on increasing liquids contribution . mid-continent area the mid-continent area includes properties in the texas panhandle, oklahoma and kansas. significant areas of activity have been in the cleveland sandstone area of western oklahoma (89% operated working interest). we drilled or participated in 31 development wells in 2009, 97% of which were successful. in 2009, we continued drilling in the cleveland sandstone formation in western oklahoma, on acreage we acquired in 2008. cleveland sandstone is a tight gas play characterized by low-permeability rock. we drilled 20 wells (included in the count above) using horizontal drilling techniques, all of which were successful, and recent wells have come on line with greater than 40% liquids production. we currently have one rig operating and expect to drill approximately the same number of wells in 2010 as we drilled in 2009. other northern region other northern region areas of activity are as follows: piceance basin the piceance basin in western colorado (approximately 89% operated working interest) is a major north america natural gas basin and is characterized by low-porosity rock. the primary productive formation is the mesaverde williams fork formation. multiple wells are drilled from individual drilling pads to reduce rig mobilization costs in mountainous terrain and to minimize environmental impact on the surface area. well spacing is approximately ten acres per well. as in the wattenberg field, piceance basin drilling time per well has been reduced due to our increased use of improved drilling technology. in the piceance basin, we are using new fit-for-purpose rigs which include design innovations and technology improvements that capture incremental time savings during all phases of the well drilling process, including moving between wells. fit-for-purpose rigs can drill multiple wells from one location and are particularly useful in developing hydrocarbon reserves in tight-gas areas such as the piceance basin. in 2009, we drilled or participated in 48 development wells and one exploratory well, 100% of which were successful. successful drilling activity in recent years has led to significant volume growth; production has grown from 2 mmcfepd in 2005 to 54 mmcfepd for fourth quarter 2009. we have assembled a significant acreage position in the piceance basin and currently hold interests in approximately 20,000 net acres providing a large inventory of future projects. at this time, we plan to operate a single-rig drilling program in 2010. tri-state area (niobrara) our operations in the tri-state area (eastern colorado, extending into kansas and nebraska) center primarily around the development of the niobrara trend (approximately 96% operated working interest). the niobrara formation is an important shallow natural gas producer. since 2006, we have expanded our acreage position to over 580,000 net acres. we have a substantial future project inventory, including niobrara infill and exploitation drilling along with gathering system and compressor station additions to develop reserves and deliver new production. in 2009, we drilled or participated in 64 development wells, 100% of which were successful, and we plan to continue our niobrara drilling program in 2010. 6 table of contents wind river basin at iron horse in the wind river basin (88% operated working interest) located in central wyoming, we drilled 18 development wells during 2009 with a 94% success rate. we plan to continue our drilling program here during 2010 and expect to drill approximately 20 new wells. bowdoin and san juan we are also active in the bowdoin field (approximately 63% operated working interest), located in north central montana and the san juan basin (approximately 82% operated working interest), located in northwestern new mexico and southwestern colorado. in 2009, activity was reduced in these areas as we focused most of our capital spending on the core development fields of wattenberg, piceance and western oklahoma. we drilled or participated in a total of 13 development wells in the bowdoin field and san juan basin, 100% of which were successful, and one unsuccessful exploratory well. southern region the southern region includes the deepwater gulf of mexico and onshore areas primarily in texas and louisiana. deepwater gulf of mexico the deepwater gulf of mexico is one of our core areas and accounted for 19% of 2009 us sales volumes and 7% of us proved reserves at december 31, 2009. we currently hold leases on 103 deepwater gulf of mexico blocks, representing approximately 390,000 net acres. we operate approximately 86% of the leases. locations of our deepwater gulf of mexico developments are shown on the map below: we continue to expand our deepwater gulf of mexico operations primarily through an active exploration program, expansion of our 3-d seismic database, and lease acquisition. our exploration activities have led to discoveries at gunflint, a 2008 discovery which is our largest deepwater gulf of mexico discovery to date; isabela; redrock/raton; and, most recently, santa cruz. during 2009, we moved forward with development plans for some of our recent discoveries, as discussed below, and continued our exploratory program. we participated in central gulf of mexico lease sale 208 and were awarded 22 new deepwater gulf of mexico blocks which will complement our growing inventory of exploration opportunities. we currently have an inventory of over 30 identified prospects, with a combination of both large stand-alone prospects as well as a number of smaller, tie-back opportunities. our exploration efforts continued during december 2009 as drilling began on two significant test wells at the deep blue prospect (green canyon block 723; 33.75% operated working interest) and one at the double mountain prospect (green canyon block 556; 30% non-operated working interest). 7 table of contents our most significant deepwater gulf of mexico properties and current development plans are discussed in more detail below: gunflint ( mississippi canyon block 948; 37.5% operated working interest and mississippi canyon block 949; 43.75% operated working interest) we announced the gunflint crude oil discovery, our largest deepwater gulf of mexico discovery to date, in october 2008. we have acquired additional seismic information and are preparing to drill one or two appraisal wells in 2010. we are the operator of the development. galapagos development project including isabela (mississippi canyon block 562, 33% non-operated working interest) and santa cruz (mississippi canyon blocks 519/563, 23.25% operated working interest) during third quarter 2009, we approved the galapagos development project, which consists of our 2007 discovery, isabela, and our 2009 discovery on adjacent acreage, santa cruz. the phased development plan includes completion of the isabela and santa cruz wells during second and third quarter 2010, and then connecting them to nearby infrastructure via subsea tiebacks. initial production is expected in 2011. during the first half of 2010, we also plan to drill the santiago exploration well (23.25% operated working interest) which is a separate prospect in the same offshore block as santa cruz. if the santiago well is successful, it will be completed in 2010, with production expected in 2011. redrock/raton (mississippi canyon blocks 204, 248 and 292; 66.67 % working interest) redrock was a 2006 natural gas/condensate discovery and raton was a 2006 natural gas discovery. the south raton appraisal well was also drilled in 2006. in 2007, we successfully sidetracked and completed the raton discovery well and it was tied back and came on production in late 2008. in 2008, we drilled a successful sidetrack-appraisal well at south raton and we currently expect it to be tied back to a host facility. redrock is currently considered a co-development candidate to the completed sidetrack well at south raton. we are the operator of redrock/raton. swordfish (viosca knoll blocks 917, 961 and 962; 85% working interest) swordfish was a 2001 discovery and began producing in 2005. during 2009, a swordfish gas well watered out. we sidetracked the well into an oil zone, and production began in january, 2010. the swordfish project currently includes three producing wells connected to a third-party production facility through subea tiebacks. we are the operator of swordfish. ticonderoga (green canyon block 768; 50% working interest) ticonderoga is a non-operated 2004 crude oil discovery and began producing in 2006. the project currently includes three producing wells connected to existing infrastructure through subea tiebacks. in september 2008, ticonderoga was shut-in as a result of hurricane damage to third-party processing and pipeline facilities. it remained shut-in until august 2009 when it was returned to full production. onshore east texas and north louisiana this is an emerging area for us. recent acquisitions have increased our leasehold acreage to approximately 17,000 gross acres. our 2009 drilling program targeted the haynesville shale (approximately 60% working interest), and we completed our first horizontal east texas haynesville shale well with an initial thirty-day average production rate of over 11 mmcfpd, gross. we drilled a second exploration well in fourth quarter 2009 that was completed in late january 2010 and is being tested. we plan to drill approximately 10 to 11 haynesville wells on our operated acreage in 2010 and participate in another seven to eight haynesville wells operated by others. international international operations are significant to our business, accounting for 44% of consolidated sales volumes in 2009 and 44% of total proved reserves at december 31, 2009. international proved reserves are approximately 64% natural gas and 36% crude oil. operations in equatorial guinea, ecuador, china and suriname are conducted in accordance with the terms of production sharing contracts. in cameroon, we operate in accordance with the terms of a production sharing contract and a mining concession. operations in the north sea, israel and other foreign locations are conducted in accordance with concession agreements or licenses. 8 table of contents sales of production and estimates of proved reserves for our

(equatorial guinea and cameroon) west africa is one of our core operating areas. crude oil and natural gas sales volumes accounted for 61% of 2009 consolidated international sales volumes and 70% of international proved reserves at december 31, 2009. at december 31, 2009, we held approximately 53,000 net developed acres and 212,000 net undeveloped acres in equatorial guinea and 563,000 net undeveloped acres in cameroon. 9 table of contents alba field we began investing in west africa in the early 1990's. activities center around our 34% non-operated working interest in the alba field, offshore equatorial guinea, which is one of our most significant assets. operations include the alba field and related production and condensate facilities, a methanol plant, and an onshore lpg processing plant (both located on bioko island) where additional condensate is produced. the methanol plant is capable of producing up to 3,000 mtpd gross. we sell our share of natural gas production from the alba field to the lpg plant, the methanol plant and an unaffiliated lng plant. the lpg plant is owned by alba plant llc (alba plant), in which we have a 28% interest accounted for by the equity method. the methanol plant is owned by atlantic methanol production company, llc (ampco), in which we have a 45% interest accounted for by the equity method. the methanol plant purchases natural gas from the alba field under a contract that runs through 2026. ampco subsequently markets the produced methanol to customers in the us and europe. alba plant sells its lpg products and condensate at our marine terminal at prevailing market prices. we sell our share of condensate produced in the alba field and from the lpg plant under short-term contracts at market-based prices. blocks o and i, yoyo and tilapia during the past several years, we have conducted a successful exploration and appraisal drilling program in the douala basin in west africa, centering around blocks o and i, offshore equatorial guinea, and the yoyo mining concession and tilapia production sharing contract offshore cameroon, where we have an interest in over 1.1 million gross acres. we are the operator in cameroon (50% working interest) and the technical operator on block o (45% working interest) and block i (40% working interest). our first discovery occurred in october 2005, when we announced successful test results from the o-1 (belinda) exploration well offshore equatorial guinea. in 2007, we drilled seven wells, resulting in three new discoveries and three successful appraisal wells. in 2008, we announced successful results from the i-5 benita oil appraisal well on block i; the felicita, a condensate and natural gas discovery on block o; and the diega, a gas condensate and oil discovery on block i. in february 2009, we announced a successful oil discovery on block o at the carmen prospect. in december 2008, we submitted a plan of development for the aseng field (formerly known as benita) to the government of equatorial guinea. on july 22, 2009, we announced that it had been sanctioned by us, our partners, and the ministry of mines, industry, and energy of the republic of equatorial guinea. initial development of the aseng field will include multiple subsea wells flowing to a floating production, storage and offloading vessel (fpso) where the production stream will be separated. the oil will be stored on the fpso until sold, while the natural gas and water will be reinjected into the reservoir to maintain pressure and maximize oil recoveries. the fpso is designed with capacity to process 120 mbpd of liquids, including 80 mbpd of oil. in addition, the vessel will be capable of reinjecting 170 mmcfpd of natural gas. storage on the vessel will be approximately 1.6 mmbbls of liquids. the vessel is designed to act as an oil production hub, and as a liquids storage and offloading hub with capabilities to support future subsea oil field developments, and capabilities to take on board, independently from the production train, stabilized condensate from gas condensate fields in the area. first production from the aseng field is estimated to commence by mid-year 2012 at 50 mbpd of oil gross (16.5 mbpd net). the fpso and subsea equipment contracts were awarded in 2009, and construction activities have begun on the fpso. we have two rigs contracted to assist in field development. drilling and completion activities have commenced. we have evaluated the potential for additional liquids and gas projects, and expect that the next development will be at the belinda field. we are engaged in geologic and reservoir feed (front end engineering design) work at belinda, targeting liquid production from this gas condensate field. we currently anticipate drilling subsea wells which will be tied to a production facility that would remove liquids and reinject gas for future use pending further development at belinda. the liquids would be transported to the fpso at aseng for storage and sales. belinda project sanction is currently scheduled to occur in 2010 with production beginning in 2013. we are also evaluating future oil projects at diega and carmen and currently scheduling first production for 2014. in 2010, we expect to resume exploration activities offshore equatorial guinea and acquire a 3-d seismic survey over yoyo and portions of tilapia in cameroon. eastern mediterranean (israel and cyprus ) another core operating area is located offshore israel. natural gas sales volumes in israel accounted for 21% of 2009 consolidated international sales volumes and natural gas reserves accounted for 11% of international proved reserves at december 31, 2009. at december 31, 2009, we held approximately 29,000 net developed acres and 796,000 net undeveloped acres located between 10 and 90 miles offshore israel in water depths ranging from 700 feet to 6,500 feet. our leasehold position in israel includes four leases and 17 licenses. we are the operator of the properties. we also hold a license covering approximately 795,000 net undeveloped acres offshore cyprus. mari-b field we have been operating in the mediterranean sea, offshore israel, since 1998, and the mari-b field (47% working interest) is one of our core international assets. the mari-b field is the first offshore natural gas production facility in israel and currently has a peak deliverability of approximately 500 mmcfpd from five wells. in 2008, we commissioned a permanent onshore receiving terminal in ashdod for distribution of natural gas from the mari-b field to purchasers. during 2009, we moved forward on a compression project that we expect will recover additional reserves and extend the field's peak deliverability. we also began mobilizing equipment to drill two development wells planned in the first half of 2010. together with the completion of the compression work, these new wells will provide substantial, additional near-term gas deliverability and serve as injection wells for natural gas storage in the future. 10 table of contents natural gas sales began in 2004 and have increased steadily as israel's natural gas infrastructure has developed. average sales volumes have risen from 48 mmcfpd in 2004 to a record high of 139 mmcfpd in 2008 and were 114 mmcfpd in 2009. the natural gas market in israel continues to be robust. the israel electric corporation limited (iec), our largest purchaser, has continued to convert power plants to use natural gas as fuel. in 2009, the iec power plant at hagit began consuming natural gas purchased from us and in december 2009 we initiated natural gas sales to a new customer, israel chemicals ltd. during third quarter 2009, we signed a new natural gas sales contract with our primary customer, iec, under the terms of which they will purchase the majority of our remaining undedicated mari-b field gas at prices expected to be significantly higher than what we have been receiving under the original contract. the actual price received is tied to a blend of liquids prices and a producer price index. in addition, it was agreed that all sales from the mari-b field going forward will be proportionately allocated between the two contracts regardless of the total volume sold. this is a major change from the past arrangement wherein only excess volumes above a threshold level received premium prices. in addition, we have signed a letter of intent (loi) with iec, under which iec expects to purchase natural gas to establish a strategic inventory reserve at mari-b. the mari-b partners would provide iec with injection, storage and withdrawal capabilities for this inventory under a related service agreement. competing imports of natural gas from egypt to israel began in 2008. however, there is still opportunity for significant new sales in the future as the israeli infrastructure and markets continue to expand. tamar and dalit during 2009, our exploratory program resulted in two significant discoveries. in january 2009, we announced a very significant natural gas discovery at the tamar-1 well at the tamar prospect (36% working interest), offshore northern israel, and in february 2009, we announced a successful test of production flow rates at the location. then in march 2009, we announced another natural gas discovery at the dalit prospect (36% working interest) followed by a successful well test in april 2009. we then drilled a tamar appraisal well (tamar-2), the results of which increased our estimate of the size of the reservoir and confirmed its high quality and extent. tamar is the largest discovery in our history. we are moving forward with tamar development plans, and expect project sanction and recording of proved reserves in the first half of 2010, with first production projected for 2012. in fourth quarter 2009, we signed an loi to sell natural gas from the tamar field to dalia power energies (dalia). dalia, a privately-owned electricity company, has a license to build a natural gas-fired power plant in israel with operations planned to commence in 2013. according to terms of the loi, we and our partners will deliver natural gas volumes of approximately 200 bcf to dalia under a 17-year supply agreement. sales volumes under the loi may be increased to 700 bcf depending upon the final size of the power plant and extent of operations. we also signed an loi to sell natural gas from the tamar field to iec. iec expects to purchase at least 95 bcf of natural gas per year with the potential to procure significantly higher quantities for a period of 15 years beginning at the startup of tamar. we continue to remain focused on the vast exploration potential remaining offshore israel. the successes at tamar and dalit opened up a substantial new natural gas basin, the levantine. a 3-d seismic program is underway to collect additional data over several leads on our acreage in the levantine. based on results from the seismic program, we are planning to drill an exploratory well in the area in the second half of 2010. other north sea we have been conducting business in the north sea (the netherlands and the uk) since 1996 and currently have working interests in 18 licenses with working interests ranging from 7% to 40%. we are the operator of one block. the north sea accounted for 8% of 2009 consolidated international sales volumes and 7% of international proved reserves at december 31, 2009. at december 31, 2009, we held approximately 6,000 net developed acres and 44,000 net undeveloped acres. most of our production is from the non-operated dumbarton field (30% working interest) in blocks 15/20a and 15/20b in the uk sector of the north sea. we also produce from the macculloch, hanze, cook and other fields. the dumbarton development, which began production in 2007, includes a subsea tie-back to the gp iii, an fpso in which we own a 30% interest. additional development (30% working interest) began in 2008, and two new wells were brought on line. during 2009, our field optimization work continued. dumbarton now has eight horizontal producers and two water injection wells. the dumbarton field experienced a controlled shut-down in august 2009, due to a malfunctioning swivel on the fpso. production was deferred for essentially all of september and october. we also participated in the development of the nearby lochranza discovery in block 15/20a (30% working interest). during 2009, the first lochranza horizontal well was completed and tied back to dumbarton's subsea facilities. production began in fourth quarter 2009. we expect a second horizontal well to be completed and come on line in the first quarter of 2010. 11 table of contents we have also participated in the flyndre project (22.5% working interest) and selkirk project (30.5% working interest), both located in the uk sector of the north sea. at flyndre, we successfully completed an exploratory appraisal well in 2007. we are currently working with the project operator and other partners to finalize the field development plan and relevant operating agreements. at selkirk, we participated in the drilling of an appraisal well which was sidetracked to the original discovery well location, to ensure presence of effective reservoir, and suspended as a future producer. we are currently working with our partners on development options. in 2009, we conducted a market test of our wholly-owned subsidiary noble energy (europe) limited, which holds our interests in the netherlands and the uk, and received bids. however, we have not committed to a plan to sell these assets. ecuador operations in ecuador accounted for 5% of 2009 consolidated international sales volumes and 8% of international proved reserves at december 31, 2009. the concession covers approximately 12,000 net developed acres and 849,000 net undeveloped acres. we have been operating in ecuador since 1996. we utilize natural gas from the amistad field (in shallow water offshore ecuador) to generate electricity through a 100%-owned natural gas-fired power plant, located near the city of machala. the machala power plant, which began operating in 2002, is a single cycle generator with a capacity of 130 mw from twin turbines. it is the only natural gas-fired commercial power generator in ecuador and currently one of the lowest cost producers of thermal power in the country. the machala power plant connects to the amistad field via a 40-mile pipeline. in 2009, power generation totaled 902 gw hours. see risk factors our operations and investment in ecuador may be adversely affected by the country's unsettled economic and political environment and item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations current conditions in ecuador . china we have been engaged in exploration and development activities in china since 1996, with production beginning in 2003. we have a 57% working interest in the cheng dao xi (cdx) field, which is located in the shallow water of the southern bohai bay. during fourth quarter 2009, we drilled one horizontal well from our existing platform at the cdx field and commenced drilling a second well. the rig will initiate a program to pre-drill a number of production and injection wells designed to be connected to a second platform at the field. this is part of the ongoing expansion project with plans to install the second platform and connect the additional wells in late 2010. china accounted for 5% of 2009 consolidated international sales volumes and 4% of international proved reserves at december 31, 2009. at december 31, 2009, we held approximately 4,000 net developed acres and no undeveloped acres. additional international locations we hold approximately four million net undeveloped acres in other international locations including suriname, nicaragua, and india. proved reserves disclosures recent sec rule-making activity in december 2008, the sec announced that it had approved revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements. the most significant amendments to the requirements included the following: commodity prices economic producibility of reserves and discounted cash flows are now based on a 12-month average commodity price unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used. disclosure of unproved reserves probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis. proved undeveloped reserves guidelines reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. reserves estimation using new technologies reserves may be estimated through the use of reliable technology in addition to flow tests and production history. reserves personnel and estimation process additional disclosure is required regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the reserves estimation process. we are also required to provide a general discussion of our internal controls used to assure the objectivity of the reserves estimate. disclosure by geographic area reserves in foreign countries or continents must be presented separately if they represent more than 15% of our total oil and gas proved reserves. non-traditional resources the definition of oil and gas producing activities has expanded and focuses on the marketable product rather than the method of extraction. we adopted the rules effective december 31, 2009. effect of adoption application of the new reserve rules resulted in the use of lower prices at december 31, 2009 for both oil and gas than would have resulted under the previous rules. use of new 12-month average pricing rules at december 31, 2009 resulted in a decrease in proved reserves of approximately 27 mmboe. use of the old year-end prices rules would have resulted in an increase in proved reserves of approximately 34 mmboe at december 31, 2009. therefore, the total impact of the new price methodology rules resulted in negative reserves revisions of 61 mmboe. in addition to the new pricing methodology rules, the new proved undeveloped reserves rules, which limit puds to those scheduled to be drilled within the next five years, resulted in an additional reduction of proved reserves of approximately 18 mmboe. 12 table of contents internal controls over reserves estimates our policies regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves estimates requires reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance and prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering principles. responsibility for compliance in reserves bookings is delegated to our corporate reservoir engineering group and requires that reserves estimates be made by the regional reservoir engineering staff and reviewed by the regional reservoir engineering supervisor. qualified petroleum engineers in our houston, denver and london offices prepare all reserves estimates for our different geographical regions. these reserves estimates are reviewed and approved by regional management and senior engineering staff with final approval by the vice president - strategic planning, environmental analysis &amp; reserves (vice president reserves) and certain members of senior management. our vice president reserves is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. our vice president reserves has a bachelor of science degree in engineering and over 20 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and evaluations. the vice president reserves reports directly to our chief executive officer. we engage a third-party petroleum consulting firm to audit a significant portion of our reserves. see third-party reserves audit below. technologies used in reserves estimation the sec's new rules expanded the technologies that a company can use to establish reserves. the sec now allows use of techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. we used a combination of production and pressure performance, wireline wellbore measurements, simulation studies, offset analogies, seismic data and interpretation, wireline formation tests, geophysical logs and core data to calculate our reserves estimates, including the material additions to the 2009 reserves estimates. third-party reserves audit in each of the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, we retained netherland, sewell &amp; associates, inc. (nsai), independent, third-party reserves engineers, to perform reserves audits of proved reserves. the reserves audit for 2009 included a detailed review of 20 of our major international, deepwater gulf of mexico and us onshore fields, which covered approximately 78% of us proved reserves and 96% of international proved reserves (86% of total proved reserves). the reserves audit for 2008 included a detailed review of 18 of our major fields and covered approximately 86% of total proved reserves. the reserves audit for 2007 included a detailed review of 16 of our major fields and covered approximately 81% of total proved reserves. in connection with the 2009 reserves audit, nsai prepared its own estimates of our proved reserves. in order to prepare its estimates of proved reserves, nsai examined our estimates with respect to reserves quantities, future producing rates, future net revenue, and the present value of such future net revenue. nsai also examined our estimates with respect to reserves categorization, using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in the recently updated regulation s-x rule 4-10(a) and subsequent sec staff interpretations and guidance. in the conduct of the reserves audit, nsai did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production. however, if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of nsai which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, nsai did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. nsai determined that our estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the sec, including the criteria of reasonable certainty, as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years, under existing economic and operating conditions, consistent with the definition in rule 4-10(a)(2) of regulation s-x. nsai issued an unqualified audit opinion on our proved reserves at december 31, 2009, based upon its evaluation. the nsai opinion concluded that our estimates of proved reserves were, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. nsai's report is attached as exhibit 99.2 to this annual report on form 10-k. the fields audited by nsai are chosen in accordance with company guidelines and result in the audit of a minimum of 80% of our total proved reserves. the fields are chosen by the vice president reserves and are reviewed by senior management and the board of directors. when compared on a field-by-field basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than the estimates of nsai. given the inherent uncertainties and judgments that go into estimating proved reserves, differences between internal and external estimates are to be expected. on a quantity basis, the nsai field estimates ranged from one mmboe above to 16 mmboe below as compared with our estimates. on a percentage basis, the nsai field estimates ranged from 9% above our estimates to 20% below our estimates. differences between our estimates and those of nsai are reviewed for accuracy but are not further analyzed unless the aggregate variance is greater than 10%. reserves differences at december 31, 2009 were, in the aggregate, approximately 21 mmboe, or 3%. 13 table of contents proved undeveloped reserves (puds) as of december 31, 2009, our puds totaled 142 mmbbls of crude oil and 769 bcf of natural gas, for a total of 270 mmboe. pud locations approximately 70% of our puds at year-end 2009 were associated with our major development areas in the wattenberg field (onshore us) and the alba field (offshore equatorial guinea). an additional 17% of puds at year-end 2009 were associated with major development projects at the aseng field (offshore equatorial guinea) and the galapagos project (deepwater gulf of mexico). all of these projects will have puds convert from undeveloped to developed as these projects begin production and/or production facilities are expanded or upgraded. changes in puds changes in puds that occurred during the year were due to: conversion of approximately 23 mmboe puds into proved developed reserves; reclassification of approximately 18 mmboe puds that were not scheduled to be developed within five years from proved to probable reserves; and negative revisions of approximately 23 mmboe in puds due to changes in commodity prices. the majority of the reserves reclassified from proved reserves to probable reserves were associated with the wattenberg field, where we maintain an extensive multi-year development program. development costs costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately $440 million in 2009, $528 million in 2008 and $390 million in 2007. estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately $900 million in 2010, $800 million in 2011, and $500 million in 2012. drilling plans all pud drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2014. puds associated with projects other than drilling (such as compression projects) are also expected to be converted to proved developed reserves prior to the end of 2014. initial production from these puds is expected to begin between 2010 to 2015. we have 7 mmboe of puds associated with an international discovery that has been booked for longer than five years. development planning is proceeding on this project, and drilling is expected to begin in the next two years. the only other puds that have been booked for longer than five years are associated with compression projects. in those cases, the reserves are expected to be recovered from existing wells. for more information see the following: item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations proved reserves for a discussion of changes in proved reserves;

(2) average crude oil sales prices reflect reductions of $2.13 per bbl (2009), $22.06 per bbl (2008), and $13.68 per bbl (2007) from hedging activities. average natural gas sales prices reflect increases of $0.23 per mcf (2008), and $1.12 per mcf (2007) from hedging activities. the effect of hedging activities on the average realized natural gas price for 2009 was de minimis. (3) average crude oil sales prices reflect reductions of $5.57 per bbl (2009), $7.59 per bbl (2008), and $2.19 per bbl (2007) from hedging activities. natural gas is under contract for $0.25 per mmbtu to a methanol plant, an lpg plant and an lng plant. sales to these plants are based on a btu equivalent and then converted to a dry gas equivalent volume. the methanol and lpg plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. the volumes produced by the lpg plant are included in the crude oil information. (4) volumes represent sales of condensate and lpg from the lpg plant in equatorial guinea. (5) we sold our argentina assets in february 2008. 15 table of contents revenues from sales of crude oil and natural gas have accounted for 90% or more of consolidated revenues for each of the last three fiscal years. at december 31, 2009, our operated properties accounted for approximately 60% of our total production. being the operator of a property improves our ability to directly influence production levels and the timing of projects, while also enhancing our control over operating expenses and capital expenditures. productive wells the number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which we held an interest at december 31, 2009 was as follows: crude oil wells natural gas wells total gross net gross net gross net united states northern region 7,825 6,119.0 5,028 3,637.9 12,853 9,756.9 southern region 799 593.0 392 175.0 1,191 768.0 equatorial guinea 4 1.7 20 7.7 24 9.4 israel - - 5 2.4 5 2.4 north sea 22 4.7 8 1.0 30 5.7 ecuador - - 3 3.0 3 3.0 china 15 8.6 1 0.6 16 9.2 total 8,665 6,727.0 5,457 3,827.6 14,122 10,554.6 productive wells are producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production. a gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. the number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. the number of net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. wells with multiple completions are counted as one well in the table above. developed and undeveloped acreage developed and undeveloped acreage (including both leases and concessions) held at december 31, 2009 was as follows: developed acreage undeveloped acreage gross net gross net (thousands) united states onshore 1,625 956 1,603 1,262 offshore 134 84 524 362 total united states 1,759 1,040 2,127 1,624 international equatorial guinea 140 53 523 212 cameroon - - 1,125 563 israel 62 29 1,790 796 north sea (1) 50 6 229 44 ecuador 12 12 849 849 china 7 4 - - suriname - - 3,087 1,389 nicaragua - - 1,977 1,977 cyprus - - 1,136 795 india - - 694 347 total international 271 104 11,410 6,972 total (2) 2,030 1,144 13,537 8,596 (1) the north sea includes acreage in the uk and the netherlands.

(2) we sold our assets in argentina in february 2008. a productive well is an exploratory, development or extension well that is not a dry well. a dry well (hole) is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well. as defined in the rules and regulations of the sec, an exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. a development well is part of a development project, which is defined as the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically producible. the number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned. in addition to the wells drilled and completed in 2009 included in the table above, at december 31, 2009, we were in the process of drilling or completing 152 gross (113.2 net) wells in the northern region of our us operations, two gross (0.7 net) onshore wells in the southern region of our us operations, two gross (0.6 net) wells in the deepwater gulf of mexico, one gross (0.3 net) well in the north sea, and one gross (0.6 net) well in china. marketing activities we seek opportunities to enhance the value of our us natural gas production by marketing directly to end-users and aggregating natural gas to be sold to natural gas marketers and pipelines. we sell our natural gas production at both market-based and fixed prices. in 2009, approximately 28% of natural gas sales were made pursuant to long-term contracts under either fixed or market-based prices. crude oil, condensate and ngls produced in the us and foreign locations are generally sold under short-term contracts at market-based prices adjusted for location and quality. in china, we sell crude oil into the local market under a long-term contract at market-based prices. in israel, we sell natural gas under long-term contracts at negotiated prices. crude oil and condensate are distributed through pipelines and by trucks or tankers to gatherers, transportation companies and refineries. 17 table of contents delivery commitments some of our natural gas sales contracts specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity of product. we have commitments to deliver approximately 220 bcf of natural gas, net to our interest, to various customers in israel through the year 2022. approximately 90% of this amount will be delivered by 2015. we expect to fulfill the delivery commitments with proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves from the mari-b and other nearby fields in israel and we d o not expect any shortfall. see international eastern mediterranean (israel and cyprus). significant purchaser glencore energy uk ltd (glencore) was the largest single non-affiliated purchaser of 2009 production and purchased our share of production from the alba field in equatorial guinea under a short-term sales contract, subject to renewal. sales to glencore accounted for 25% of 2009 crude oil sales, or 16% of 2009 total oil and gas sales. no other single non-affiliated purchaser accounted for 10% or more of crude oil and natural gas sales in 2009. we believe that the loss of any one purchaser would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since there are numerous potential purchasers of our production. hedging activities commodity prices were volatile in 2009 and prices for crude oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. we have used derivative instruments, and expect to do so in the future, in order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas. for additional information, see item 1a. risk factors hedging transactions may limit our potential gains and we are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables, hedging transactions, and cash investments , item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, and item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 6. derivative instruments and hedging activities. termination of contracts see item 1a. risk factors our operations and investment in ecuador may be adversely affected by the country's unsettled economic and political environment, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating outlook current conditions in ecuador, and item 8. financial statements and supplementary data 3. impairments. regulations government regulation exploration for, and production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas are extensively regulated at the international, federal, state and local levels. crude oil and natural gas development and production activities are subject to various laws and regulations (and orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto) governing a wide variety of matters, including, among others, allowable rates of production, transportation, prevention of waste and pollution and protection of the environment. laws affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion and frequently increase the regulatory burden on companies. our ability to economically produce and sell crude oil and natural gas is affected by a number of legal and regulatory factors, including federal, state and local laws and regulations in the us and laws and regulations of foreign nations. many of these governmental bodies have issued rules and regulations that are often difficult and costly to comply with, and that carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. these laws, regulations and orders may restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist in the absence of such laws, regulations and orders. the regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases our costs of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. see item 1a. risk factors we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks that may cause us to incur substantial costs. examples of us federal agencies with regulatory authority over our exploration for, and production and sale of, crude oil and natural gas include: the bureau of land management (blm) and the minerals management service (mms), which under laws such as the federal land policy and management act, endangered species act, national environmental policy act and outer continental shelf lands act have certain authority over our operations on federal lands, particularly in the rocky mountains and deepwater gulf of mexico; the us environmental protection agency (epa) and the occupational safety and health administration, which under laws such as the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, as amended, the resource conservation and recovery act, as amended, the oil pollution act of 1990, the clean air act, the clean water act, the occupational safety and health act and the recent final mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule have certain authority over environmental, health and safety matters affecting our operations as discussed below; the federal energy regulatory commission, which under laws such as the energy policy act of 2005 has certain authority over the marketing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas we produce onshore and from the deepwater gulf of mexico; the department of transportation, which has certain authority over the transportation of products, equipment and personnel necessary to our us onshore and deepwater gulf of mexico operations; and other federal agencies with certain authority over our business, such as the internal revenue service and the sec, as well as the nyse upon which shares of our common stock are traded. in january 2010, the blm announced that it will be issuing a new draft oil and gas leasing policy that will require, among other things, a more detailed environmental review prior to leasing oil and natural gas resources, increased public engagement in the development of master leasing and development plans prior to leasing areas where intensive new oil and gas development is anticipated, and a comprehensive parcel review process. as the policy has not yet been released, we are not able to determine the impact these potential leasing policy changes may have on our business. 18 table of contents most of the states within which we operate have separate agencies with authority to regulate related operational and environmental matters. examples of such regulation on the operational side include the greater wattenberg area special well location rule 318a, which was adopted by the colorado oil and gas conservation commission to address oil and gas well drilling, production, commingling and spacing in the wattenberg field, and the same commission's december 10, 2008 approval of a comprehensive update to statewide rules governing oil and gas operations in colorado. these rules were reviewed by the colorado legislature in its 2009 session and became effective in the second quarter of 2009, addressing areas such as public drinking water protection, monitoring and disclosure of chemicals used in drilling operations, erosion management and environment and wildlife protection. on the environmental side, colorado regulation seven and requirements for storm water management plans were adopted by the colorado department of environmental quality, under delegation from the epa, to regulate air emissions, water protection and waste handling and disposal relating to our oil and gas exploration and production. some of the counties and municipalities within which we operate have adopted regulations or ordinances that impose additional restrictions on our oil and gas exploration and production. an example is garfield county, colorado, which provides local land and road use restrictions affecting our piceance basin operations and requires us to post bonds to secure any restoration obligations. our international operations are subject to legal and regulatory oversight by energy-related ministries of our host countries, each having certain relevant energy or hydrocarbons laws. examples of these ministries include the ecuador ministry of nonrenewable natural resources, the equatorial guinea ministry of mines, industry and energy, the israel ministry of national infrastructures, and the uk department of energy and climate change. an example of a law affecting our international operations is the uk finance act of 2006, which increased the income tax rate on our uk operations effective january 1, 2006. environmental matters as a developer, owner and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. we must take into account the cost of complying with environmental regulations in planning, designing, drilling, operating and abandoning wells. in most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. under state and federal laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by us or prior owners or operators in accordance with current laws or otherwise, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas, or to perform remedial well plugging operations or cleanups to prevent future contamination. the epa and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. the owner and operator of a site, and persons that treated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site, may be liable, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. the epa, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, third parties are authorized to take actions in response to threats to human health or the environment and to seek to recover from responsible classes of persons the costs of such action. furthermore, certain wastes generated by our crude oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and, therefore, be subject to considerably more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements. see item 1a. risk factors we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks that may cause us to incur substantial costs . federal and state occupational safety and health laws require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in our operations. certain portions of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. we are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in federal workplace standards. certain state or local laws or regulations and common law may impose liabilities in addition to, or restrictions more stringent than, those described herein. we have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with environmental requirements. we do not believe that we have, to date, expended material amounts in connection with such activities or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. although such requirements do have a substantial impact on the crude oil and natural gas industry, they do not appear to affect us to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry. competition the crude oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. we encounter competition from other crude oil and natural gas companies in all areas of operations, including the acquisition of seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. our competitors include major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies and numerous independent crude oil and natural gas companies, individuals and drilling partnership programs. many of our competitors are large, well established companies. such companies may be able to pay more for seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. see item 1a. risk factors we face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources . 19 table of contents geographical data we have operations throughout the world and manage our operations by country. information is grouped into five components that are all primarily in the business of crude oil, natural gas and ngl exploration, development and production: united states, west africa, eastern mediterranean, north sea, and other international, corporate and marketing. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 15. segment information. employees our total number of employees increased from 1,571 at december 31, 2008 to 1,630 at december 31, 2009. the 2009 year-end employee count includes 154 foreign nationals working as employees in ecuador, israel, the uk, equatorial guinea and cameroon. we regularly use independent contractors and consultants to perform various field and other services. offices our principal corporate office, including our offices for us and international operations, is located at 100 glenborough drive, suite 100, houston, texas 77067-3610. we maintain additional offices in ardmore, oklahoma and denver, colorado and in china, cameroon, ecuador, equatorial guinea, israel and the uk. title to properties we believe that our title to the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with generally accepted industry standards, subject to exceptions that would not materially detract from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. in addition, interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments, net profits interest, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, development obligations under crude oil and natural gas leases or capital commitments under production sharing contracts or exploration licenses. available

additional risks that are not presently material or known. you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k. if any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. in addition, the current global economic environment intensifies many of these risks. future economic conditions in the us and key international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results. the us and other world economies are slowly recovering from a recession which began in 2008 and extended into 2009. growth has resumed, but is modest. there are likely to be significant long-term effects resulting from the recession and credit market crisis, including a future global economic growth rate that is slower than what was experienced in recent years. in addition, more volatility may occur before a sustainable, yet lower, growth rate is achieved. global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. a lower future economic growth rate will result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which will reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability. 20 table of contents crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and a substantial reduction in these prices could adversely affect our results and the price of our common stock. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production. historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. for example, the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2009 ranged from a high of $81.37 per barrel to a low of $33.98 per barrel. the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2009 ranged from a high of $6.07 per mmbtu to a low of $2.51 per mmbtu. the markets and prices for crude oil and natural gas depend on factors beyond our control. these factors include demand for crude oil and natural gas, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil and natural gas; actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations; political conditions and events (including instability or armed conflict) in crude oil or natural gas producing regions; the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories; the price and level of imported foreign crude oil and natural gas; the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels; the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure; the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity; weather conditions; electricity generation; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and the overall economic environment. significant declines in crude oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business: limiting our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and operations; reducing the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically; causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects; reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows; or limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt. in addition, significant declines in the forward commodity price curves may result in the following: a reduction in the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties; or a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill. we recorded asset impairment charges during 2009. if commodity prices decline during 2010, there could be additional impairments of our oil and gas assets or other investments or an impairment of goodwill. market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility. during 2009, credit markets recovered but remain vulnerable to unpredictable shocks should weaker than expected economic growth persist. we have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. we and our partners will need to seek financing in order to fund these or other activities. our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. this could significantly delay development of our property interests. failure to fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect our properties. our exploration, development, and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures especially in the case of our active drilling programs, such as the wattenberg field, and o ur significant exploration and development programs in the deepwater gulf of mexico, west africa and israel. significant capital investments on our inventory of major development p rojects will start next year and are estimated to be approximately $1 billion per year in 2010 and 2011. first production from these projects is not expected until 2011 and thereafter. historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, our revolving bank credit facility and debt issuances. future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of crude oil and natural gas, and our success in finding, developing and producing new reserves. if revenues were to decrease as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or decreased production, and our access to debt or capital were limited, we would have a reduced ability to replace our reserves, resulting in a decrease in production over time. if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our obligations and fund our capital budget, we may not be able to access capital markets on an economic basis to meet these requirements. if we are not able to fund our capital expenditures, interests in some properties might be reduced or forfeited as a result. 21 table of contents indebtedness may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility. as of december 31, 2009, we had long-term indebtedness of $2 billion (excluding unamortized discount), with $382 million drawn under our bank credit facility. our indebtedness represented 25% of our total book capitalization at december 31, 2009. our indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including the following: a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and future indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, pay dividends and make certain investments and may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry; additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants; additional financing in the future is likely to have higher costs due to the negative impact of the credit market crisis which restricted access to the bond markets; changes in the credit ratings of our debt may negatively affect the cost, terms, conditions and availability of future financing, and lower ratings will increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility; and we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions. we may incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration, development and acquisition activities such as our pending acquisition of additional us rocky mountain assets. a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our liquidity may become impaired and we default on our debt obligations. our ability to meet our debt obligations and reduce our level of indebtedness depends on future performance. general economic conditions, crude oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. hedging transactions may limit our potential gains. in order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we enter into crude oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. our hedges, consisting of a series of contracts, are limited in duration, usually for periods of one to three years. while intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains if crude oil and natural gas prices rise over the price established by the arrangements. global commodity price fluctuation has been significant in 2009. such volatility disrupts our ability to forecast and, as a result, we may become even more reliant on our hedging program. in trying to manage our exposure to commodity price risk, we may end up hedging too much or too little, depending upon how our crude oil or natural gas volumes and our production mix fluctuate in the future. in addition, hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which our production is less than expected; there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement; the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts crude oil or natural gas prices. we cannot assure that our hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of volatility in crude oil or natural gas prices. 22 table of contents we are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables, hedging transactions and cash investments. we are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, and other receivables. we sell our crude oil, natural gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers. in addition, we are the operator on large joint venture development projects such as aseng in equatorial guinea and tamar in israel. as operator of the joint ventures, we pay joint venture expenses and bill our nonoperating partners for their respective shares of joint venture costs. some of our purchasers and joint venture partners are not as creditworthy as we are and may experience liquidity problems. credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the way of parental guarantees or letters of credit, including our largest international crude oil purchaser; however, not all of our trade credit is protected through guarantees or credit support. nonperformance by a trade creditor or joint venture partner could result in significant financial losses. we also monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. however, disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty's liquidity, which could impair their ability to perform under the terms of the hedging contract. we are unable to predict sudden changes in financial market conditions or a counterparty's creditworthiness or ability to perform. even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. to mitigate counterparty credit risk we conduct our hedging activities with a diverse group of major financial institutions. we use master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. if we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net settled at the time of election. net settlement refers to a process by which all transactions between counterparties are resolved into a single amount owed by one party to the other. during periods of falling commodity prices, such as in late 2008 and first quarter 2009, our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our counterparty exposure. if the creditworthiness of our counterparties, which are major financial institutions, deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss. we have over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. during the first half of 2009, we shortened the duration of our bank deposits and held over 50% of our cash and cash equivalents in us treasury securities. we maintained this investment posture well into the third quarter of 2009 before we started to reduce our us treasury holdings in favor of reinvestment back into money market funds and time deposits with highly rated banks. we monitor the creditworthiness of the banks and financial institutions with which we invest and review the securities underlying our investment accounts. however, we are unable to predict sudden changes in solvency of our financial institutions. in the event of a bank failure, we could incur a significant loss. we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure. exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other unfortuitous events such as blowouts, cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. our international operations are also subject to political risk. in accordance with industry practices, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential perils confronting our operations and in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economic. consistent with that profile, our insurance program is structured to provide us financial protection from unfavorable loss severity resulting from damages to or the loss of physical assets or loss of human life, liability claims of third parties, and business interruption (loss of production) attributed to certain assets. although we believe the coverages and amounts of insurance carried are adequate, we may not have sufficient protection against some of the risks we face, because we chose not to insure certain risks, insurance is not available on commercially reasonable terms or actual losses exceed coverage limits. if an event occurs that is not covered by insurance or not fully protected by insured limits, it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. failure to effectively execute our major development projects could result in significant delays and/or cost over-runs, damage to our reputation, limitations on our growth and negative effects on our operating results. we currently have an extensive inventory of major development projects, several of which will take years before first production, including the aseng oil project, tamar, gunflint, and others. some of these projects, such as oil and gas projects in west africa, have a great deal of complexity. this level of development will require significant effort from our management and technical personnel as well as place additional burden on our financial resources and internal financial controls. we may not be able to attract and retain personnel with the skills necessary to bring complicated projects to successful conclusions. in addition, we will have increased dependency on third-party technology and service providers and other vendors for these complex projects. significant delays in delivery of essential items or performance of services, cost overruns, vendor insolvency, or other critical supply failure, could adversely affect development of our projects. we may not be able to manage these and other risks effectively. 23 table of contents we may be unable to make attractive acquisitions, integrate acquired businesses and/or assets, or adjust to the effects of divestitures, causing a disruption to our business. one aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement or expand our current business, such as our patina merger in 2005, our purchase of u.s. exploration in 2006 and the pending acquisition of additional us rocky mountain assets. this may present greater risks for us than those faced by peer companies that do not consider acquisitions as a part of their business strategy. we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. even if we do identify attractive opportunities, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the acquisition due to capital market constraints, even if such capital is available on commercially acceptable terms. if we acquire another business, we could have difficulty integrating its operations, systems, management and other personnel and technology with our own, or could assume unidentified or unforeseeable liabilities, resulting in a loss of value. we also engage in portfolio rationalization, such as the sale of our interest in argentina in 2008, and the majority of our gulf of mexico shelf properties in 2006. these transactions can also result in changes in operations, systems, or management and other personnel. organizational modifications due to acquisitions, divestitures or portfolio rationalizations, or other strategic changes can alter the risk and control environments, disrupt ongoing business, distract management and employees, increase expenses and adversely affect results of operations. even if these difficulties could be overcome, we cannot provide assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, divestiture or other strategic change would be realized. estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are not precise. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value, including factors that are beyond our control. reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. in accordance with the sec's revisions to rules for oil and gas reserves reporting, which we adopted effective december 31 , 2009, our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. the estimates depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including: historical production from the area compared with production from other areas; the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including the impact of the sec's new oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements; assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices; future operating costs; severance and excise taxes; development costs; and workover and remedial costs. for these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates. additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. in addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. a change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved. exploration, development and production risks and natural disasters could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues. our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including: pipeline ruptures and spills; fires; explosions, blowouts and cratering; formations with abnormal pressures; equipment malfunctions; hurricanes, such as gustav and ike in 2008, which could affect our operations in areas such as the gulf coast and deepwater gulf of mexico, and cyclones, which could affect our operations offshore china; and other natural disasters. any of these can result in loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others. 24 table of contents exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves. we do not always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our drilling operations. the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically, and area well data and other data may be limited or less-developed in some of the international areas in which we explore. the cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. our efforts will be unprofitable if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough reserves to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or other irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions; compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment. the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and other oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget. our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. during these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater and their availability may be limited, particularly in areas of high activity and demand in which we concentrate, such as the rocky mountains and deepwater gulf of mexico, and in some international locations that typically have more limited availability of equipment and personnel, such as ecuador, israel and west africa. during periods of increasing levels of exploration and production in response to strong demand for crude oil and natural gas, the demand for oilfield services and the costs of these services increase. additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. in the current economy, even though commodity prices have fallen from the high levels experienced in 2008, the costs of drilling rigs, equipment and supplies, though somewhat reduced, have not decreased to the levels that existed before the run-up in commodity prices that occurred in the first half of 2008. if drilling costs decline significantly, our long-term drilling rig contracts may require us to pay rates higher than the current market. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations for additional information on drilling rig contracts. as a result, an increase in profits may be more dependant on cost reduction than in previous years. exploration and development in the deepwater gulf of mexico involves significant financial risks . much of the deepwater gulf of mexico area lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure necessary for production. as a result, development of a deepwater discovery, such as gunflint, may be a lengthy process and require substantial capital investment. we participate in certain other projects, such as isabela and double mountain, for which we are not the operator. if we are not the operator of a project, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the project or its costs. this could prevent the realization of targeted return on capital or lead to unexpected future losses. in addition, there is limited availability of suitable drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure, qualified operating personnel, and deepwater drilling rigs are typically subject to long-term contracts. this can lead to difficulty and delays in consistently obtaining drilling rigs and other equipment and services at acceptable rates, which, in turn, may lead to projects being delayed or increased costs. this also makes it difficult to estimate the timing of production. we face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources. we operate in the highly competitive areas of crude oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation, acquisition and production. we face intense competition from a large number of independent, technology-driven companies as well as both major and other independent crude oil and natural gas companies in a number of areas such as: seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration; marketing our crude oil and natural gas production; seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop properties; and attracting and retaining employees with certain skills. 25 table of contents many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us. for example, in the deepwater gulf of mexico we compete with major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies and in international locations such as the north sea we compete with major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies as well as state-controlled multinational companies. in addition, the economic recession has increased competitive pressures. crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, as well as service and drilling companies, are striving to improve efficiency and profitability, primarily through cost reduction. this highly competitive environment could have an adverse impact on our business. the marketability of our rocky mountain and gulf of mexico production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control. the marketability of our production from the rocky mountain area and the deepwater gulf of mexico depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. we deliver crude oil and natural gas produced from these areas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. the lack of availability of capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through some firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, or may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us. any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our international operations may be adversely affected by economic and political developments. we have significant international crude oil and natural gas operations compared to companies we consider to be our peers, with approximately 44% of our 2009 consolidated sales volumes coming from international operations. these operations may be adversely affected by political and economic developments, including the following: war, terrorist acts, civil disturbances, or territorial disputes, such as may occur in regions that encompass our operations, including ecuador, israel and west africa; loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of actions taken by foreign crude oil and natural gas producing nations, such as expropriation or nationalization of assets and renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts, such as may occur pursuant to the hydrocarbons law enacted in 2006 by the government of equatorial guinea; changes in taxation policies, such as the uk finance act of 2006, which increased the income tax rate on our uk operations effective january 1, 2006, and the china petroleum special profits tax enacted in 2006, which imposed an excise tax on crude oil produced in the country; laws and policies of the us and foreign jurisdictions affecting foreign investment, taxation, trade and business conduct; foreign exchange restrictions; international monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the us dollar as compared with the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business, such as the uk; and other hazards arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which we conduct operations. we may not have enough insurance to cover any loss of property resulting from these risks. our operations and investment in ecuador may be adversely affected by the country's unsettled economic and political environment. the economic and political environment in ecuador has become increasingly unsettled. we are aware that the government of ecuador is taking steps to renegotiate contracts or, in some cases, remove international oil and gas companies from its borders. we continue to have significant delinquent accounts and unpaid invoices related to electricity sales from our machala power plant, and we recently entered into independent power purchase agreements for such sales, the long-term effect of which on payment is unknown. on august 24, 2009, we became aware that our proposed plan of development for the amistad field (offshore ecuador), which had been submitted to ecuador's national bureau of hydrocarbons, had been rejected. in addition, on december 31, 2009, ecuador's state oil company (petroecuador) requested that ecuador's minister of nonrenewable natural resources commence termination of our production sharing contract. on february 11, 2010, the minister notified us of petroecuador's request by delivering to us a copy of a letter of non-compliance dated december 31, 2009. the minister provided us with 60 business days to respond to the allegations contained in the letter. we are uncertain as to the potential outcome of this matter, resolution of which could ultimately lead to a further reduction in the value of our investments in ecuador which, as of december 31, 2009, had a net book value of approximately $72 million. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 3. asset impairments. 26 table of contents we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks that may cause us to incur substantial costs. from time to time, in varying degrees, political developments and federal and state laws and regulations affect our operations. in particular, price controls, taxes and other laws relating to the crude oil and natural gas industry, changes in these laws and changes in administrative regulations have affected and in the future could affect crude oil and natural gas production, operations and economics. we cannot predict how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect these adoptions and interpretations may have on our business or financial condition. our business is subject to laws and regulations promulgated by international, federal, state and local authorities relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas, as well as safety matters. legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. we may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. our operations are subject to complex international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations including, for example, in the case of federal laws, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, as amended, the resource conservation and recovery act, as amended, the oil pollution act of 1990, the clean air act, the clean water act and the occupational safety and health act. environmental laws and regulations change frequently and the implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations could negatively impact our operations. the discharge of natural gas, crude oil, or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation. in addition, we may incur costs and penalties in addressing regulatory agency procedures involving instances of possible non-compliance. increased regulation of business practices could result in increased operating costs. the current trend is toward increased regulation of business practices and additional reporting requirements. for example the epa has recently issued the final mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule, which requires many suppliers of fossil fuels or industrial chemicals, manufacturers of vehicles and engines, and other facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to begin collecting greenhouse gas emissions data under a new reporting system on january 1, 2010 with the first annual report due march 31, 2011. we will be subject to these new reporting requirements, which will result in additional effort on the part of our personnel. in addition, other pending legislation, such as the pending climate change legislation that includes establishing a cap and trade system for restricting greenhouse gas emissions in the us, or pending hydraulic fracturing legislation that would subject the process of hydraulic fracturing to regulation under the safe drinking water act, if enacted, will require an unprecedented compliance effort on the part of companies in the oil and gas industry. we may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with additional reporting requirements. the proposed us federal budget for fiscal year 2011 includes certain provisions that, if passed as originally submitted, will have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. on february 1, 2010, the obama administration released its proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2011. the proposed budget would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and impose new taxes. the provisions include: elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; increases in the taxation of foreign source income; levy of an excise tax on gulf of mexico oil and gas production; repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies; increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers; and implementation of a fee on non-producing leases located on federal lands. if these proposals are enacted, our taxes will increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. this could also reduce our drilling activities. since none of these proposals have yet to be voted on or become law, we do not know the ultimate imp act they may have on our business. the adoption of pending climate change legislation could result in increased operating costs, create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities, and reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. in june 2009, the house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of 2009, also known as the waxman-markey bill. the senate's version, the clean energy jobs and american power act, or the boxer-kerry bill, has been introduced, but has not passed. although these bills include several differences that require reconciliation before becoming law, both bills contain the basic feature of establishing a cap and trade system for restricting greenhouse gas emissions in the us. under such system, certain sources of greenhouse gas emissions would be required to obtain greenhouse gas emission allowances corresponding to their annual emissions of greenhouse gases. the number of emission allowances issued each year would decline as necessary to meet overall emission reduction goals. as the number of greenhouse gas emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly. the ultimate outcome of this legislative initiative remains uncertain. in addition to the pending climate legislation, the epa has issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect january 1, 2010, and require reporting by regulated facilities by march 2011 and annually thereafter. beyond measuring and reporting, the epa issued an endangerment finding under section 202(a) of the clean air act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. the epa has proposed regulation that would require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities, and may issue final rules this year. since approximately 60% of our 2009 crude oil production and 51% of our 2009 natural gas production derive from the us, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of us greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. 27 table of contents federal hydraulic fracturing legislation could increase our costs and restrict our access to oil and gas reserves. several proposals are before congress that, if implemented, would subject the process of hydraulic fracturing to regulation under the safe drinking water act. hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production. we find that the use of hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas from many reservoirs. such legislation could have a significant impact on our development of the wattenberg field, our largest onshore us field. although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay our ability to develop oil and gas reserves. derivatives regulation could restrict our ability to execute commodity derivative instruments as a hedge against fluctuating commodity prices. various measures are being proposed by committees of congress, the us treasury department, and other agencies to restrict the use of over-the-counter (otc) derivative instruments. these proposals include, but are not limited to, requiring cash collateral on all otc derivatives and requiring all otc derivatives to be executed and settled through an exchange system. although we do not currently know the exact form any final legislation or rule-making activity will take, any restriction on the use of otc instruments could have a significant impact on our business. limits on the use of otc instruments could significantly reduce our ability to execute strategic price hedges to reduce price uncertainty and to protect cash flows. in addition, cash collateral requirements could create significant liquidity issues and exchange system trades may restrict our ability to execute derivative instruments to fit our strategic needs. healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us. on november 7, 2009, the house of representatives passed its healthcare reform bill, the affordable health care for america act, h.r. 3962. among other initiatives, this bill authorizes the creation of a national public plan that would negotiate rates with providers and would be offered through a new national health insurance exchange market. on december 24, 2009, the senate passed its own version of a healthcare reform bill, the patient protection and affordable care act, h.r. 3590. the senate bill contains no provision for a public plan but does authorize the creation of at least two multi-state plans. at this time, it remains unclear how or when the differences between the two bills will be resolved, or if a final bill ultimately will be enacted. various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. we cannot predict what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. however, an expansion in government's role in the us healthcare industry could have a significant impact on our employment benefits and related costs. we face various risks associated with the trend toward increased activism against oil and gas development activities. opposition toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing domestically as well as in countries belonging to the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd), an international group of member countries sharing a commitment to democratic government and market economy. companies in the petroleum industry, such as us, are often the target of activist efforts regarding safety, human rights, environmental compliance and business practices. anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain projects such as development of oil shale. future activist efforts could result in the following: delay or denial of drilling permits; shortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size; restrictions on installation or operation of gathering or processing facilities; damaging publicity about us; increased costs of doing business; reduction in demand for our products; and other adverse affects on our ability to develop our properties and expand production our need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 28 table of contents provisions in our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us. under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of our common or preferred stock without approval of our shareholders. issuance of these shares could make it more difficult to acquire us without the approval of our board of directors as more shares would have to be acquired to gain control. in addition, delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. these provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders. disclosure regarding forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k and the documents incorporated by reference in this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. these forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our growth strategies; our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources; anticipated trends in our business; our future results of operations; effect of current volatility in the credit markets; our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration, development, and acquisition activities; market conditions in the oil and gas industry; our ability to make and integrate acquisitions; and the impact of governmental regulation. forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as may, will, expect, anticipate, estimate and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. these forward-looking statements are made based upon management's current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. we caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. you should consider carefully the statements under item 1a. risk factors and other sections of this report, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. 61 quantitative and

energy, inc. (the "company" or "noble energy") is a delaware corporation, formed in 1969, that has been publicly traded on the new york stock exchange ("nyse") since 1980. noble energy is an independent energy company that has been engaged, directly or through its subsidiaries, in the exploration, development, production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas since 1932. in this report, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the "company" or the "registrant" refers to noble energy and its subsidiaries. exploration activities include geophysical and geological evaluation and exploratory drilling on properties for which the company has exploration rights. noble energy operates throughout major basins in the united states including colorado's wattenberg field, the mid-continent region of western oklahoma and the texas panhandle, the san juan basin in new mexico, the gulf coast and the gulf of mexico. noble energy also operates internationally, in equatorial guinea, the mediterranean sea, ecuador, the north sea, china, argentina and suriname. the company is noted for its innovative methods of marketing its international natural gas reserves through projects such as its methanol plant in equatorial guinea and its natural gas-to-power project in ecuador. on may 16, 2005, noble energy completed a merger (the "patina merger") with patina oil &amp; gas corporation ("patina"). noble energy, through its subsidiary noble energy production, inc., acquired the common stock of patina for a total purchase price of approximately $4.9 billion, which was comprised primarily of cash and noble energy common stock, plus liabilities assumed. patina was an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition and development of crude oil and natural gas properties within the continental united states. patina's properties and crude oil and natural gas reserves are principally located in relatively long-lived fields with established production histories. the properties are primarily concentrated in the wattenberg field of colorado's denver-julesburg ("d-j") basin, the mid-continent region of western oklahoma and the texas panhandle, and the san juan basin in new mexico. see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 3 merger with patina oil &amp; gas corporation." throughout this report, all share and per share data except par value have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the company's two-for-one stock split, effected in the form of a stock dividend distributed on september 14, 2005 to shareholders of record as of august 31, 2005. strategy noble energy is a worldwide producer of crude oil and natural gas. the company's strategy is to achieve growth in earnings and cash flow through the development of a high quality portfolio of producing assets that is balanced between domestic and international projects. the patina merger allowed noble energy to achieve a strategic objective of enhancing its u.s. asset portfolio and has resulted in a company with assets and capabilities that include growing u.s. basins, coupled with a significant portfolio of international properties. after the patina merger, noble energy has approximately 36% greater production than 2004 with a reserve base that is balanced between domestic and foreign sources. in addition, the company has been reducing its investment in the gulf of mexico's conventional shallow shelf and shifting its domestic offshore exploration focus to gulf of mexico deepwater areas. noble energy is now a larger, more diversified company with greater opportunities for both domestic and international growth through high upside exploration drilling as well as lower risk exploitation projects. 3 current developments pending purchase of u.s. exploration holdings, inc. in february 2006, noble energy announced that it had agreed to purchase u.s. exploration holdings, inc. ("u.s. exploration"), a privately held corporation located in billings, montana, for $411.0 million. the acquisition will expand noble energy's operations in its core wattenberg field, where the company currently owns 218,000 net acres. proved reserves of u.s. exploration are estimated to be 248 billion cubic feet equivalent (bcfe), of which 41% are proved developed and 55% are natural gas. u.s. exploration's reserves and production are located on approximately 65,000 net acres in the d-j basin's wattenberg field. the majority of the acreage operated by u.s. exploration lies within the scope of amendments to colorado oil and gas conservation commission rule 318a, which allow for increased density drilling in the field to 20-acre spacing. u.s. exploration currently owns interests in 512 active wells. capital spending on the u.s. exploration properties will be focused on accelerating production and reserve development. in 2006, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $100 million. subject to customary conditions, the transaction is scheduled to close on or before march 29, 2006. upon closing, noble energy will pay $411.0 million in cash for the common stock of u.s. exploration. prior to closing, u.s. exploration will retire all company debt, terminate its commodity hedges and make all severance payments. noble energy has executed hedges on its own production volumes from march 2006 through 2010 that are equivalent to just over 50% of u.s. exploration's expected volumes. the hedges are in the form of collars. the average floors on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are $6.23 per mmbtu and $58.74 per bbl. the average ceilings on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are $9.17 mmbtu and $72.52 per bbl. the natural gas hedges are priced at the cig index and thereby include basis differentials to henry hub. crude oil and natural gas operations for more information regarding noble energy's crude oil and natural gas properties, see "item 2. properties crude oil and natural gas properties" of this form 10-k. exploration and development activities north america noble energy has been engaged directly or through its subsidiaries in exploration, exploitation and development activities onshore north america since 1932 and in the gulf of mexico since 1968. the patina merger significantly increased the breadth of the company's onshore operations. the company's onshore portfolio at december 31, 2005 included 1,267,048 gross developed acres and 812,750 gross undeveloped acres, of which 642,035 gross developed acres and 500,423 gross undeveloped acres were acquired in the patina merger. onshore production was derived from 10,410 gross wells (7,641 net wells). in the gulf of mexico, noble energy holds interests in 278 blocks. at december 31, 2005 offshore production was derived from 343 gross wells (188 net wells). international equatorial guinea noble energy began its investment in the alba field (34% working interest in one block) offshore equatorial guinea in the early 1990's. natural gas production from the alba field is sold to a methanol plant on bioko island under a contract that runs through 2026. the methanol plant is owned by atlantic methanol production company, llc ("ampco"), in which the company has a 45% interest. ampco markets the methanol in europe and the u.s. natural gas production is also sold to a liquid petroleum gas ("lpg") plant, in which the company has a 28% interest. noble energy's share of condensate produced in the alba field and from the lpg plant is being sold under a short-term contract at market-based prices. the company has entered into an additional natural gas sales contract, which runs through 2023, with an unaffiliated liquefied natural gas ("lng") plant, which is currently under 4 construction. the lng plant is expected to begin production in 2008. noble energy has expanded its activities in equatorial guinea with exploration activities in blocks "o" and "i" (45% and 40% working interest, respectively) on which it is the technical operator. israel noble energy has been operating in the mediterranean sea, offshore israel, since 1998. the company has a 47% working interest under an exploration agreement covering three licenses and two leases and is the operator. natural gas is produced from the mari-b field, the first offshore natural gas production facility in the state of israel. natural gas sales began in 2004 and have been increasing as a purchaser of the company's production, the israel electric corporation limited, developed its capacity to take natural gas at its eshkol power station. additionally, noble energy commenced sales of natural gas to the bazan oil refinery located in ashdod in the fourth quarter of 2005. noble energy has also contracted to sell mari-b natural gas to other industrial users including a desalinization plant and a paper mill. sales to these facilities are currently expected to begin in 2007. north sea noble energy has been engaged in exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties in the north sea (the netherlands and the united kingdom) since 1996. the company has working interests in 17 licenses with working interests ranging from 6.5% to 100%. noble energy is the operator of three blocks. ecuador noble energy has been operating in ecuador since 1996. the company is currently utilizing the natural gas from the amistad field (offshore ecuador) to generate electricity through its 100%-owned natural gas-fired power plant, located near the city of machala. the machala power plant, which began operating in 2002, is a single cycle generator with a daily capacity of 130 mw from twin turbines. it is the only natural gas-fired commercial power generator in ecuador and currently one of the lowest cost producers of thermal power in the country. china noble energy has been engaged in exploration and development activities in china since 1996. the company developed the cheng dao xi oil field in bohai bay and production began in 2003. noble energy's share of crude oil production is sold into the domestic chinese market pursuant to a long-term contract at market-based prices. argentina noble energy has had a presence in argentina since 1996 and is currently participating in an expansion of the el tordillo field in the san jorge basin. suriname in 2005, noble energy entered into a participation agreement on block 30 in offshore suriname, a country located on the northern coast of south america. a seismic program is currently underway. production activities revenues from sales of crude oil and natural gas and from gathering, marketing and processing have accounted for 90% or more of consolidated revenues for each of the last three fiscal years. at december 31, 2005, noble energy operated properties accounting for approximately 59% of the company's total production. being the operator of a property allows the company to manage production and to control timing and amounts of operating expenses and capital expenditures. acquisition and disposition activities the company maintains an ongoing portfolio optimization program. the company may engage in acquisitions of additional crude oil or natural gas properties, additional interests in its existing assets or entities owning crude oil and natural gas properties or related assets. the company may also divest non-core assets in order to maintain a balanced portfolio with high-quality, core properties. on may 16, 2005 noble energy completed the patina merger. values preliminarily allocated to proved and unproved properties acquired were $2.6 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. patina's long-lived crude oil and natural gas reserves provide a significant inventory of low-risk opportunities that balance noble energy's portfolio. the preliminary allocation of the purchase price included $874.8 million of goodwill. 5 during 2005, 2004 and 2003, the company spent approximately $0.6 million, $85.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, on the acquisition of proved crude oil and natural gas properties (excluding patina properties), and, during 2005, 2004 and 2003, spent approximately $16.9 million, $44.7 million, and $10.2 million, respectively, on acquisitions of unproved properties (excluding patina properties). these properties were acquired through various offshore lease sales, domestic onshore lease acquisitions and international concession negotiations. during 2004, the company completed a significant asset disposition program that had begun in 2003. the asset disposition program included five domestic property packages, representing estimated reserves of 24.2 mmboe. the sales price for the five packages of properties totaled $130 million. 2006 budget the company has budgeted capital expenditures of approximately $1.26 billion for 2006. approximately 23% of the 2006 capital budget has been allocated to exploration opportunities and 77% has been allocated to production, development and other projects. domestic spending is budgeted for $860 million (68% of the 2006 capital budget), international expenditures are budgeted for $380 million (30%) and corporate expenditures are budgeted for $20 million (2%). the 2006 budget does not include the impact of possible asset purchases, including the previously announced pending purchase of u.s. exploration as well as anticipated development costs associated with u.s. exploration. marketing activities marketing stranded gas with major projects in equatorial guinea, ecuador and israel, noble energy has substantial natural gas reserves that, until recently, had no market. in equatorial guinea, noble energy and its partners constructed an lpg plant and a low-cost methanol plant. the recently completed phase 2a and 2b expansion projects have increased gross lpg and condensate production. in ecuador, noble energy's amistad field had no market until the company constructed a natural gas-fired power plant near machala. the machala power plant is one of the lowest cost thermal power producers in ecuador. offshore israel, noble energy discovered natural gas in the mari-b field. while israel has not traditionally been a consumer of natural gas and has no other significant domestic hydrocarbon sources, noble energy has negotiated contracts to provide natural gas to the israel electric corporation limited, bazan oil refinery and other industrial users. natural gas marketing natural gas produced by the company in the united states is sold under short-term or long-term contracts at market-based prices. in equatorial guinea and israel, noble energy sells natural gas to end-users under long-term contracts at negotiated prices. at december 31, 2005, approximately 28% of noble energy's natural gas sales were made pursuant to long-term contracts. crude oil and condensate marketing crude oil and condensate produced by the company in the united states and foreign locations is generally sold under short-term contracts at market-based prices adjusted for location and quality. crude oil and condensate are distributed through pipelines and by trucks or tankers to gatherers, transportation companies and end-users. noble energy marketing, inc. noble energy markets portions of its domestic natural gas production through noble energy marketing, inc. ("nemi"), a wholly-owned subsidiary. nemi seeks opportunities to enhance the value of the company's domestic natural gas production by marketing directly to end-users and aggregating natural gas to be sold to natural gas marketers and pipelines. nemi also engages in the purchase and sale of third-party crude oil and natural gas production. such third-party production may be purchased from non-operators who own working interests in the company's wells or from other producers' properties in which the company owns no interest. noble energy has a long-term natural gas sales contract with nemi, whereby the company receives an index price for all natural gas sold to nemi. the contract does not specify scheduled quantities or delivery points and expires on may 31, 2009. the company sold approximately 55% of its domestic natural gas production to nemi in 2005. 6 significant purchasers glencore energy u.k., ltd. ("glencore") was the largest single non-affiliated purchaser of noble energy's 2005 production. glencore was a purchaser of the company's share of condensate from the alba field in equatorial guinea. sales to glencore accounted for approximately 24% of 2005 crude oil sales, or approximately 11% of 2005 total oil and gas sales and royalties. no other single non-affiliated purchaser accounted for 10% or more of noble energy's 2005 oil and gas sales and royalties. the company believes that the loss of any one purchaser would not have a material effect on the company's financial position or results of operations since there are numerous potential purchasers of the company's production. hedging activities commodity prices remained volatile during 2005. prices for crude oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors that are beyond the company's control. noble energy has used derivative instruments, and expects to do so in the future, to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing its exposure to commodity price fluctuations. for additional information, see "item 1a. risk factors hedging transactions may limit our potential gains ", "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk", and "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 12 derivative instruments and hedging activities." regulations governmental regulation exploration for, and production and sale of, crude oil and natural gas are extensively regulated at the international, national, state and local levels. crude oil and natural gas development and production activities are subject to various laws and regulations (and orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto) governing a wide variety of matters, including, among others, allowable rates of production, prevention of waste and pollution and protection of the environment. laws affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion and frequently increase the regulatory burden on companies. noble energy's ability to economically produce and sell crude oil and natural gas is affected by a number of legal and regulatory factors, including federal, state and local laws and regulations in the united states and laws and regulations of foreign nations. many of these governmental bodies have issued rules and regulations that are often difficult and costly to comply with, and that carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. these laws, regulations and orders may restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist in the absence of such laws, regulations and orders. the regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases its costs of doing business and consequently affects the company's profitability. environmental matters as a developer, owner and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. we must take into account the cost of complying with environmental regulations in planning, designing, drilling, operating and abandoning wells. in most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. under state and federal laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by us or prior owners or operators in accordance with current laws or otherwise, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas, or to perform remedial well plugging operations or cleanups to prevent future contamination. the environmental protection agency and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. the owner and operator of a site, and persons that treated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site, may be liable, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. the environmental protection agency, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, third parties are authorized to take actions in response to threats to human health or the environment and to seek to recover from responsible classes of persons the costs of such action. furthermore, certain wastes generated by our crude oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes 7 may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and, therefore, be subject to considerably more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements. see "item 1a. risk factors we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks that may cause us to incur substantial costs ." federal and state occupational safety and health laws require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in our operations. certain portions of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. we are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in federal workplace standards. certain state or local laws or regulations and common law may impose liabilities in addition to, or restrictions more stringent than, those described herein. the company has made and will continue to make expenditures in its efforts to comply with environmental requirements. the company does not believe that it has, to date, expended material amounts in connection with such activities or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the company. although such requirements do have a substantial impact upon the energy industry, they do not appear to affect the company any differently, or to any greater or lesser extent, than other companies in the industry. insurance the company maintains various types of insurance coverages as are customary in the industry that include directors and officers liability, general liability, well control, pollution, acts of terrorism, physical damage insurance and business interruption insurance for certain international locations. the company self-insures, is a shareholder in an industry mutual insurance company and purchases policies from third party insurance providers to cover various risks. the company believes the coverages and types of insurance are adequate. the company self-insures the medical and dental coverage provided to certain of its employees, certain workers' compensation and the first $1.0 million of its general liability coverage. liabilities are accrued for self-insured claims, or when estimated losses exceed coverage limits, and when sufficient information is available to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. competition the crude oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. the company encounters competition from other crude oil and natural gas companies in all areas of operations, including the acquisition of seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. the company's competitors include major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies and numerous independent crude oil and natural gas companies, individuals and drilling and income programs. many of the company's competitors are large, well established companies. such companies may be able to pay more for seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. the company's ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon its ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. see "item 1a. risk factors we face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources ." geographical data the company has operations throughout the world and manages its operations by country. information is grouped into five components that are all primarily in the business of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production: united states, equatorial guinea, north sea, israel, and other international, corporate and marketing. for more information, see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 15 geographical data." 8 employees the total number of employees of the company increased during the year from 559 at december 31, 2004 to 1,171 at december 31, 2005, primarily due to the patina merger. the 2005 year-end employee count includes 108 foreign nationals working as employees of the company in equatorial guinea, the united kingdom, ecuador and israel. available information the company's website address is www.nobleenergyinc.com. available on this website under "investor relations investor relations menu sec filings," free of charge, are noble energy's annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k, forms 3, 4 and 5 filed on behalf of directors and officers and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission ("sec"). also posted on the company's website, and available in print upon request by any stockholder to the investor relations department, are charters for the company's audit committee; compensation, benefits and stock option committee; corporate governance and nominating committee; and environment, health and safety committee. copies of the code of business conduct and ethics, and the code of ethics for chief executive and senior financial officers (the "codes") are also posted on the company's website under the "corporate governance" section. within the time period required by the sec and the nyse, as applicable, the company will post on its website any modifications to the codes and any waivers applicable to senior officers as defined in the applicable code, as required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 ("sarbanes-oxley"). in 2005, the company submitted the annual certification of its chief executive officer regarding the company's compliance with the nyse's corporate governance listing standards, pursuant to section 303a.12(a) of the nyse listed company manual. item 1a. risk factors. crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and a substantial reduction in these prices could adversely affect our results and the price of our common stock. our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production. historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. the markets and prices for crude oil and natural gas depend on factors beyond our control. these factors include demand for crude oil and natural gas, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil and natural gas; actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations; political conditions and events (including instability or armed conflict) in crude oil-producing or natural gas-producing regions; the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories; the price and level of foreign imports; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of alternative fuels; the availability of pipeline capacity; the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity; weather conditions; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and the overall economic environment. 9 significant declines in crude oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business: limiting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations; reducing the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically; causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects; reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flow; reducing the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties; or limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt. failure to fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect our properties. if revenues substantially decrease as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, we may have limited ability to spend the capital necessary to replace our reserves or to maintain production at current levels, resulting in a decrease in production over time. we expect to continue to make capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves. historically, we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations and proceeds from debt and equity financings. however, if cash flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy capital expenditure requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing or other sources of capital to meet these requirements. if we are not able to fund our capital expenditures, then interests in some properties might be reduced or forfeited. we may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses and/or assets, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business. one aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement or expand our current business. we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. even if we do identify attractive candidates, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the acquisition of them or do so on commercially acceptable terms. additionally, if we acquire another business, we could have difficulty integrating its operations, systems, management and other personnel and technology with our own. these difficulties could disrupt ongoing business, distract management and employees, increase expenses and adversely affect results of operations. even if these difficulties could be overcome, we cannot provide assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition would be realized. estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are not precise. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value, including many factors that are beyond our control. reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. the estimates depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including: historical production from the area compared with production from other areas; the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices; future operating costs; severance and excise taxes; development costs; and workover and remedial costs. for these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the 10 same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. accordingly, reserve estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates. additionally, because most of our reserve estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. in addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. lack of certainty with respect to development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved. exploration, development and production risks and natural disasters could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues. our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including: pipeline ruptures and spills; fires; explosions, blowouts and cratering; formations with abnormal pressures; equipment malfunctions; hurricanes; and other natural disasters. any of these can result in loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others. exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves. we do not always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our drilling operations. the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. the cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. our efforts will be unprofitable if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough reserves to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions; compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment. the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and other oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget. our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. during these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially 11 greater and their availability may be limited. as a result of increasing levels of exploration and production in response to strong prices of crude oil and natural gas, the demand for oilfield services has risen and the costs of these services are increasing, while the quality of these services may suffer. additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure. as protection against operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses, including the loss of wells, blowouts, pipeline leakage or other damage, certain costs of pollution control and physical damages on certain assets. our insurance coverage includes crude oil and natural gas properties and construction insurance, marine cargo insurance and third party and comprehensive general liability insurance. except for our operations in israel and equatorial guinea, we do not carry business interruption insurance. we may not have sufficient coverage for some of the risks we face, either because insurance is not available on commercially reasonable terms or because of single event limitations by our insurer. if an event occurs that is not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance, it could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, we cannot fully insure against pollution and environmental risks. we face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources. we operate in the highly competitive areas of crude oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation, acquisition and production. we face intense competition from a large number of independent, technology-driven companies as well as both major and other independent crude oil and natural gas companies in a number of areas such as: seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration; marketing our crude oil and natural gas production; and seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop properties. many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us. this highly competitive environment could have an adverse impact on our business. we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks that may cause us to incur substantial costs. from time to time, in varying degrees, political developments and federal and state laws and regulations affect our operations. in particular, price controls, taxes and other laws relating to the crude oil and natural gas industry, changes in these laws and changes in administrative regulations have affected and in the future could affect crude oil and natural gas production, operations and economics. we cannot predict how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect of these adoptions and interpretations may have on our business or financial condition. our business is subject to laws and regulations promulgated by international, federal, state and local authorities, relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas, as well as safety matters. legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. we may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. our operations are subject to complex international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, as amended, the resource conservation and recovery act, as amended, the oil pollution act of 1990 and the clean water act. environmental laws and regulations change frequently, and the implementation of new, or the modification of existing laws or regulations could harm us. the discharge of natural gas, crude 12 oil, or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation. our international operations may be adversely affected by economic and political developments. we have significant international crude oil and natural gas operations. as a result, those operations may be adversely affected by political and economic developments, including war, terrorism and other instability, expropriation or nationalization, royalty and tax increases, and other laws or policies in these countries, as well as united states policies affecting trade, taxation, and investment in other countries. significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves. our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, our revolving bank credit facility and debt and equity issuances. future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of crude oil and natural gas, and our success in developing and producing new reserves. if revenue were to decrease as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or decreased production, and our access to capital were limited, we would have a reduced ability to replace our reserves. if our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet our obligations and fund our capital expenditure budget, we may not be able to access debt, equity or other methods of financing on an economic basis to meet these requirements. our level of indebtedness may limit our financial flexibility. as of december 31, 2005, we had long-term indebtedness of $2.035 billion, with $1.28 billion drawn under our bank credit facility. our long-term indebtedness represented 40% of our total book capitalization at december 31, 2005. our level of indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including the following: a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and future indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, pay dividends and make certain investments and may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry; additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants; changes in the credit ratings of our debt may negatively affect the cost, terms, conditions and availability of future financing, and lower ratings will increase the interest rate and fees we pay on our revolving credit facility; and we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions. we may incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration and development activities. a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. our ability to meet our debt obligations and reduce our level of indebtedness depends on future performance. general economic conditions, crude oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. many of these factors are beyond our control and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. 13 hedging transactions may limit our potential gains. in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we enter into crude oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. our hedges, consisting of a series of contracts, are limited in duration, usually for periods of one to four years. however, in connection with acquisitions, sometimes our hedges are for longer periods. while intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains if crude oil and natural gas prices rise over the price established by the arrangements. in trying to manage our exposure to price risk, we may end up hedging too much or too little, depending upon how our crude oil or natural gas volumes and our production mix fluctuate in the future. in addition, hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which our production is less than expected; there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement; the counterparties to our future contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts crude oil or natural gas prices. we cannot assure you that our hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in crude oil or natural gas prices. provisions in our certificate of incorporation, stockholder rights plan and delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us. under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of our common or preferred stock without approval of our stockholders. issuance of these shares could make it more difficult to acquire us without the approval of our board of directors as more shares would have to be acquired to gain control. we also have a stockholder rights plan, commonly known as a "poison pill," that entitles our stockholders to acquire additional shares of our company, or a potential acquirer of our company, at a substantial discount from market value in the event of an attempted takeover without the approval of our board. finally, delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. these provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our stockholders. disclosure regarding forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k and the documents incorporated by reference in this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. these forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our growth strategies; our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources; anticipated trends in our business; our future results of operations; our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities; market conditions in the oil and gas industry; our ability to make and integrate acquisitions; and the impact of governmental regulation. forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate" and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. these forward-looking statements are made based upon management's current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. we caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward- 14 looking statements. you should consider carefully the statements under item 1a. risk factors and other sections of this report, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

costs, from continuing operations, consisting of lease operating expense, workover expense, production and ad valorem taxes and transportation costs increased $112.4 million, or 56%, in 2005 compared to 2004. the increase was due to higher production volumes attributed to newly-acquired patina properties and to higher per-unit production and ad valorem taxes. production costs increased $39.3 million, or 24%, in 2004 compared to 2003. the increase was due to new operations in israel, increased production from the ramp-up of phase 2a in equatorial guinea and new production in the gulf of mexico. other factors affecting operations expense included increased service costs and workovers. the table below includes the crude oil and natural gas production costs from continuing operations by

depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in 2005, dd&amp;a expense from continuing operations increased $82.4 million, or 27%, due to higher production from patina properties and in equatorial guinea. in 2005, dd&amp;a expense includes $11.3 million of abandoned assets expense and $14.2 million of dd&amp;a related to capitalized asset retirement costs. the dd&amp;a rate for 2005 has decreased primarily due to increasing low-cost volumes in equatorial guinea and israel. in 2004, dd&amp;a expense from continuing operations remained flat versus 2003. although production increased during 2004, unit rates decreased primarily due to increased low-cost volumes in equatorial guinea and israel. in 2004, dd&amp;a expense includes $15.4 million of abandoned assets expense and $16.3 million of dd&amp;a related to capitalized asset retirement costs. included in dd&amp;a for 2003 is $20.6 million of abandoned assets expense and $20.2 million of dd&amp;a related to capitalized asset

exploration expense $ 148,818 $ 94,691 $ 134 $ 10,503 $ 7,825 $ 35,665 (1) other international includes ecuador, china and argentina. exploration expense increased $61.4 million, or 52%, during 2005 as compared with 2004. the increase was due to increased dry hole expense in the u.s. where a total of 36.8 net wells were classified as dry holes and expensed during the year. exploration expense declined $31.8 million, or 21%, in 2004 compared with 2003. costs related to 18.2 net wells were included in dry hole expense for 2004. exploration expense for 2003 included a pre-tax charge of $20.2 million ($5.9 million after tax) to write off the company's investment in vietnam. lower dry hole expense also contributed to lower overall exploration expense for 2004. costs related to 23.3 net wells were included in dry hole expense for 2003. impairment of operating assets during 2005, the company recorded $5.4 million of impairments, related to downward reserve revisions on four domestic properties. in 2004, the company recorded $9.9 million of impairments, primarily related to downward reserve revisions on two domestic properties. in 2003, the company recorded $31.9 million of impairments, primarily related to a reserve revision on a gulf of mexico property after recompletion and remediation activities produced less-than-expected results. selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative ("sg&amp;a") expenses increased $38.3 million, or 62%, in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased $6.9 million, or 13%, in 2004 compared to 2003. the increase in sg&amp;a expenses for 2005 reflects additional costs incurred relating to the combined operations of noble energy and patina. the increase in sg&amp;a expenses for 2004 primarily reflects fees associated with the implementation of 48 sarbanes-oxley and increased salaries and bonuses. on a boe basis, sg&amp;a expenses were $1.94, $1.60 and $1.65 for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. interest expense and capitalized interest interest expense totaled $96.2 million, $61.6 million and $61.1 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. capitalized interest totaled $8.7 million, $8.2 million and $13.4 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. interest is capitalized on the company's development projects using an interest rate equivalent to the average rate paid on the company's long-term debt. capitalized interest is included in the cost of oil and gas assets and amortized with other costs on a unit-of-production basis. the majority of the capitalized interest relates to long lead-time projects in the deepwater gulf of mexico and internationally, primarily phase 2a in equatorial guinea. interest expense includes $0.8 million in 2005 and $0.5 million in 2004 related to the reclassification of the deferred hedging loss from aoci related to the settlement of an interest rate lock. the company entered into the interest rate lock in late 2003 to protect against a rise in interest rates prior to the issuance of its $200 million senior unsecured notes in april 2004. at the time of the debt offering, the fair market value of the interest rate lock was a liability of $7.6 million ($4.9 million, net of tax). this amount is included in aoci and is being amortized into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the company's 5 1 / 4 % senior notes due april 2014. deferred compensation adjustment in connection with the patina merger, noble energy acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities related to a deferred compensation plan. the assets of the deferred compensation plan are held in a rabbi trust and include shares of noble energy common stock, which are classified as treasury stock. increases or decreases in the market value of the deferred compensation liability, including the shares of noble energy common stock held by the rabbi trust, are included as deferred compensation adjustments in the company's consolidated statements of operations. the company recorded deferred compensation expense of $17.9 million from the date of the patina merger through december 31, 2005. at december 31, 2005, 69% of the market value of the assets in the rabbi trust related to noble energy common stock. loss on involuntary conversion the net loss on involuntary conversion of assets for 2005 is equal to the amount of the company's insurance deductible related to damage caused by hurricane katrina which primarily consisted of the destruction of the main pass 306d platform. estimated salvage and clean-up expenses are expected to cost $67.0 million. the company has been notified by its insurance carrier that it should expect to recover no more than 50% of its total claim due to submission of total industry claims from katrina damage in excess of a $1 billion ceiling limitation per event. however, the company currently expects to recover sufficient insurance proceeds to cover the expected salvage and clean-up costs and has offset anticipated insurance proceeds against the accrued salvage and clean-up expense except for the $1.0 million deductible. the loss for 2004 is the insurance deductible related to infrastructure damage at main pass 293/305/306 caused by hurricane ivan. the company expects to fully recover through insurance proceeds all salvage and clean-up expenses and a portion of its redevelopment capital. future additional expenditures for redevelopment will be capitalized as development costs, net of any remaining insurance proceeds. as of december 31, 2005, based upon work completed, noble energy has submitted $84.0 million (cumulative) in claims related to hurricane ivan damage, none of which has been disputed, and received $49.0 million (cumulative) in reimbursements. the company received an additional $35.0 million in reimbursements in january 2006. in february 2006, the company received insurance reimbursements of $6.4 million related to hurricane katrina damage. noble energy expects to continue to incur costs, submit claims and receive reimbursements in the normal course of business in 2006 and beyond. the company will adjust the total loss attributable to the involuntary conversions in the period in which the contingencies related to the replacement costs are resolved. the company does not recognize a gain until the insurance 49 reimbursement has been received. the loss of production is not covered by business interruption insurance. pension expense the company recognized an actuarially-computed net periodic benefit expense related to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $11.0 million, $9.1 million and $7.9 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. this expense reflects an expected return on pension plan assets of 8.25%, 8.5% and 8.5% during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. allowance for doubtful accounts the company is exposed to credit risk and takes reasonable steps to protect itself from nonperformance by its debtors, but is not able to predict sudden changes in its debtors' creditworthiness. the company periodically assesses its provision for bad debt allowance. the company had allowances for doubtful accounts as of december 31, 2005 and 2004 of $18.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively. during 2005, the allowance had a net increase of $5.6 million which included an increase of $11.3 million, net of collections, for ecuador power operations, offset by $6.4 million in final write-offs of allowances recorded in prior years. during 2004, the allowance was increased by $5.4 million to reflect additional collection allowances resulting from higher power prices in ecuador and $1.4 million due to various allowances related to the company's domestic business. other expense (income), net as a result of the impacts of hurricanes katrina and rita on the timing of the company's forecasted production during the fourth quarter of 2005, derivative instruments hedging approximately 6,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 40,000 mmbtu per day of natural gas no longer qualified for hedge accounting. accordingly, beginning october 1, 2005 the changes in fair value of these derivative contracts were recognized in the company's results of operations, causing a mark-to-market gain of $20.0 million ($13.0 million, net of tax). in addition, the delay in the timing of the company's production resulted in a loss of $51.8 million in fourth quarter 2005 ($33.7 million, net of tax) related to amounts previously recorded in aoci. both the gain and the loss are included in other expense (income), net on the statements of operations. other expense (income), net for 2004 includes a gain of $4.4 million ($2.9 million, net of tax) from a transaction in which the company exchanged its interests in the tweedsmuir development project and the producing buchan and hannay fields located in the north sea for an interest in the currently producing macculloch field, also located in the north sea. the company received a total of $8.2 million in cash as part of the exchange. other expense (income), net for 2003 includes gains related to the sale of various domestic properties, excluding the properties included in discontinued operations. income taxes income tax expense associated with continuing operations increased to $322.9 million in 2005 from $199.2 million in 2004 due primarily to the increase in income. the effective income tax rate decreased to 33.3% in 2005 from 38.8% in 2004. this decrease is primarily due to the company's ability to claim a foreign tax credit for the income taxes paid by its foreign branch operations, as well as to a benefit realized on the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act. income tax expense associated with continuing operations increased to $199.2 million in 2004 from $50.5 million in 2003 due primarily to the increase in income. this increase in income tax expense was offset by the elimination of the company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to china foreign loss carryforwards. the effective income tax rate increased to 38.8% in 2004 from 36.0% in 2003. this increase is primarily due to the tax benefit of the vietnam write-off in 2003, partially offset by the benefit of the release of the china 50 valuation allowance in 2004 and the greater weighting toward domestic income in 2004 which is taxed at lower rates than income sourced from operations outside the u.s. see "note 8 income taxes." discontinued operations summarized results of discontinued operations are as follows for the years ended december 31: 2004 2003 (in thousands) oil and gas sales and royalties $ 12,575 $ 106,339 write down to market value and realized gain (loss) 14,996

2003 and recognized a non-cash pre-tax charge of $9.0 million ($5.8 million, net of tax) in the first quarter of 2003 as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle due to adoption of this standard. item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. commodity price risk derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes the company is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations. management believes that the company is well positioned with its mix of crude oil and natural gas reserves to take advantage of future price increases that may occur. however, the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, the company has used derivative hedging instruments and may do so in the future as a means of managing its exposure to price changes. such instruments include variable to fixed price swaps and costless collars. as of december 31, 2005, the company had open costless collar positions related to its natural gas and crude oil production as follows: natural gas crude oil average price per mmbtu average price per bbl production period mmbtupd floor ceiling bopd floor ceiling 2006 (nymex) 3,699 $ 5.00 $ 8.00 1,865 $ 29.00 $ 34.93 2007 (brent) 6,748 45.00 70.63 2008 (brent) 4,077 45.00 66.52 2009 (brent) 3,074 45.00 63.04 51 as of december 31, 2005, the company had open fixed price swap positions related to its natural gas and crude oil production as follows: natural gas crude oil production period mmbtupd average price per mmbtu bopd average price per bbl 2006 (nymex) (1) 170,000 $ 6.49 16,600 $ 40.47 2007 (nymex) 170,000 6.04 17,100 39.19 2008 (nymex) 170,000 5.67 16,500 38.23 (1) includes derivative instruments of 40,000 mmbtupd of natural gas and 6,000 bopd of crude oil that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment at december 31, 2005. these derivative instruments were re-designated as cash flow hedges in february 2006. the hedging instruments above represent 27% of the company's expected worldwide natural gas production in 2006, 2007, and 2008, and 22% of the company's expected worldwide crude oil production in 2006, 2007, and 2008. as of december 31, 2005, the company had a net unrealized loss of $1.2 billion (pre-tax) related to crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments entered into for hedging purposes. a net unrealized loss of $763.8, net of tax, is recorded in aoci in the shareholders' equity section of the company's balance sheet and will be recognized in earnings as adjustments to revenue as the individual contracts are settled. in anticipation of the purchase of u.s. exploration, expected to close on or before march 29, 2006, noble energy has executed hedges on its own production volumes. the hedges are for the period march 2006 through 2010 and are equivalent to just over 50% of u.s. exploration's expected volumes. the hedges are in the form of collars. the average floors on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are $6.23 per mmbtu and $58.74 per bbl. the average ceilings on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are $9.17 per mmbtu and $72.52 per bbl. the natural gas hedges are priced at the cig index and thereby include basis differentials to henry hub. the instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges. derivative instruments held for trading purposes nemi, from time to time, employs various derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of production. while most of the purchases are made for an index-based price, customers often require prices that are either fixed or related to nymex. in order to establish a fixed margin and mitigate the risk of price volatility, nemi may convert a fixed or nymex sale to an index-based sales price (such as purchasing a nymex futures contract at the henry hub with an adjoining basis swap at a physical location). due to the size of such transactions and certain restraints imposed by contract and by noble energy guidelines, the company believes it had no material market risk exposure from these derivative instruments as of december 31, 2005. unrealized gains and losses are reflected in earnings as incurred. interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its variable and fixed interest rate debt. as of december 31, 2005, the company had $2.035 billion of debt outstanding of which $650 million was fixed-rate debt. the company believes that anticipated near term changes in interest rates will not have a material effect on the fair value of the company's fixed-rate debt and will not expose the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss. the remainder of the company's debt at december 31, 2005 was variable-rate debt and, therefore, exposes the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. at december 31, 2005, $1.385 billion of variable-rate debt was outstanding. a 10% change in the floating interest rates applicable to the december 31, 2005 balance would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $6.7 million. the company occasionally enters into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. changes in fair value of interest rate swaps or interest rate "locks" used as cash flow hedges are 52 reported in aoci, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. at december 31, 2005, aoci included $4.1 million, net of tax, related to a settled interest rate lock. this amount is being reclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the term of the company's 5 1 / 4 % senior notes due april 2014. foreign currency risk the company has not entered into foreign currency derivatives. the u.s. dollar is considered the primary currency for each of the company's international operations. transactions that are completed in a foreign currency are translated into u.s. dollars and recorded in the financial statements. transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and the company does not believe it is currently exposed to any material risk of loss on this basis. transaction gains or losses are included in other expense (income), net on the statements of operations. 53quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - cautionary statement for purposes of the private securities

spent approximately $81 million in 2001 and $18 million in 2000 on acquisitions of unproved properties. these properties were acquired primarily through various offshore lease sales, domestic onshore lease acquisitions and international concession negotiations. for more information, see item 2. properties crude oil and natural gas of this form 10 -k. marketing nemi seeks opportunities to enhance the value of the company domestic natural gas by marketing directly to end users and aggregating gas to be sold to natural gas marketers and pipelines. during 2002, approximately 83 percent of nemi total sales were to end users. nemi is also actively involved in the purchase and sale of natural gas from other producers. such third-party natural gas may be purchased from non-operators who own working interests in the company wells or from other producers properties in which the company may not own an interest. nemi, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, noble gas pipeline, inc., engages in the installation, purchase and operation of natural gas gathering systems. noble energy has a short-term natural gas sales contract with nemi, whereby the company is paid an index price for all natural gas sold to nemi. the company sold approximately 66 percent of its natural gas production to nemi in 2002. third-party sales, including derivative transactions, are recorded as gathering, marketing and processing revenues. nemi records the amount paid to noble energy and third parties as gathering, marketing and processing costs and expenses. all intercompany sales and expenses are eliminated in the company consolidated financial statements. the company has a small number of long-term natural gas contracts representing less than four percent of its total natural gas sales. crude oil produced by the company is sold to purchasers in the united states and foreign locations at various prices depending on the location and quality of the crude oil. the company has no long-term contracts with purchasers of its crude oil production. crude oil and condensate are distributed through pipelines and by trucks to gatherers, transportation companies and end users. nemi markets approximately 30 percent of the company crude oil production as well as certain third-party crude oil. the company records all of nemi sales as gathering, marketing and processing revenues and records cost of sales in gathering, marketing and processing costs. all intercompany sales and expenses are eliminated in the company consolidated financial statements. 4 crude oil prices are affected by a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the company. the company average crude oil price increased $.68 from $23.30 per bbl in 2001 to $23.98 per bbl in 2002. due to the volatility of crude oil prices, the company, from time to time, has used hedging instruments and may do so in the future as a means of controlling its exposure to price changes. for additional information, see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - cautionary statement for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and other federal securities laws of this form 10 -k. critical accounting policies and practices the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. the company estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are the most significant. all of the reserve data in this form 10 -k are estimates. reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves. the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. as a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. the company accounts for its crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting. under this method, costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized. capitalized costs of producing crude oil and natural gas properties are amortized to operations by the unit-of-production method based on proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves on a property-by-property basis as estimated by company engineers. through december 31, 2002, estimated future restoration and abandonment costs are recorded by charges to depreciation, depletion and amortization ( dd&amp;a ) expense over the productive lives of the related properties. the company generally recognizes revenue when the product is delivered to a third-party purchaser. the company follows the entitlements method of accounting for its natural gas imbalances. natural gas imbalances occur when the company sells more or less natural gas than it is entitled to under its ownership percentage of total natural gas production. any excess amount received above the company share is treated as a liability. if less than the company entitlement is received, the underproduction is recorded as a receivable. the company, directly or through its subsidiaries, from time to time, uses various derivative arrangements in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations. such arrangements include fixed price hedges, costless collars and other contractual arrangements. the company accounts for its derivative arrangements under statement of financial accounting standard ( sfas ) no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and has elected to designate its derivative arrangements as cash flow hedges. other significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment; valuation allowances for receivables, inventories and deferred income tax assets; environmental liabilities; valuation of derivative instruments; and assets and obligations related to employee benefits. actual results could differ from those estimates. management believes it is necessary to understand the company significant accounting policies, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this form 10-k. costs and expenses crude oil and natural gas operations expense, consisting of lease operating expense, workover expenses, production taxes and other related lifting costs, was flat overall, in absolute dollars, in 2002 compared to 2001. in the north sea, operations expense increased 78 percent due to a full year of production operations from the hanze field and the commencement of operations from the hannay field in march 2002. in equatorial guinea, operations expense increased 45 percent due to the increased production from the alba field. domestic operations expense decreased in absolute terms during 2002 offsetting the international increases. crude oil and natural gas operations expense increased 10 percent overall in 2001 from 2000. in the north sea, operations expense increased 16 percent due to the commencement of operations of the hanze field in august 2001. in equatorial guinea, operations expense increased 61 percent due to the commencement of natural gas deliveries to the methanol plant in may 2001. included in operations expense were workover costs of $8.5 million, $15.1 million and $21.1 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. the workovers increased operations expense in such periods by $.04, $.07 and $.10 per mcfe, respectively. in 2002, dd&amp;a expense increased slightly compared to 2001. in the north sea, dd&amp;a expense increased 71 percent due to a full year production of the hanze field. in equatorial guinea, dd&amp;a expense increased 50 percent due to the results of the field expansion, which included a full year of natural gas sales to the methanol plant. the unit rate of dd&amp;a per boe was $7.92 in 2002. in 2001, dd&amp;a expense increased 23 percent overall compared to 2000. in the united states, dd&amp;a expense increased 22 percent due to increased development costs incurred in the gulf of mexico to stabilize production volumes. in the north sea, dd&amp;a expense increased 34 percent due to the commencement of production from the hanze field in august 2001. in equatorial guinea, dd&amp;a expense increased 186 percent due to the commencement of natural gas sales to the methanol plant in may 2001. the unit rate of dd&amp;a per boe was $7.70 in 2001. through december 31, 2002, the company provided for the cost of future liabilities related to restoration and dismantlement costs for offshore facilities. this provision is based on the company best estimate of such costs to be incurred in future years based on information from the company engineers. these estimated costs were provided through charging dd&amp;a expense using a ratio of production divided by reserves multiplied by the estimated costs to dismantle and restore. the company adopted sfas no. 143 on january 1, 2003 and will recognize, as the fair value of asset retirement obligations, $99.7 million related to the united states and $10.0 million related to the north sea. the company accumulated provision for future dismantlement and restoration cost was $84.1 million at 29 december 31, 2002, $80.0 million at december 31, 2001 and $79.7 million at december 31, 2000. the company has not determined the cumulative effect of adoption of this standard. total estimated future dismantlement and restoration costs of $206.6 million, which consists of $188.7 million for the united states and $17.9 million for the north sea, are included in future production and development costs for purposes of estimating the future net revenues relating to the company proved reserves. for more information, seequantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - cautionary statement for purposes of the private securities

risk and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - cautionary statement for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and other federal securities laws of this form 10-k/a. this report contains consolidated financial statements of the company for the years ended december 31, 2001 and 2000. the nature of the restatement adjustments that the company has made to its financial statements for the years ended december 31, 2001 and 2000 are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in this report. the net impact of the adjustments include the following: investment in unconsolidated subsidiary and long-term debt each increased by approximately $125 million as of december 31, 2001. income from investment in unconsolidated subsidiary and interest expense each increased by approximately $12 million for each of the years ended december 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. there was no impact to reported net income in 2001 or 2000. net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities each decreased by approximately $12 million for each of the years ended december 31, 2001 and december 31, 2000. generally, no attempt has been made in the following discussion to modify or update other disclosures, except as required to reflect the effects of the above items. critical accounting policies and practices the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. the company estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are the most significant. all of the reserve data in this form 10-k/a are estimates. reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves. the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. as a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. the company accounts for its crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting. under this method, costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized. capitalized costs of producing crude oil and natural gas properties are amortized to operations by the unit-of-production method based on proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves on a property-by-property basis as estimated by company engineers. through december 31, 2002, estimated future restoration and abandonment costs are recorded by charges to depreciation, depletion and amortization ( dd&amp;a ) expense over the productive lives of the related properties. the company generally recognizes revenue when the product is delivered to a third-party purchaser. the company follows the entitlements method of accounting for its natural gas imbalances. natural gas imbalances occur when the company sells more or less natural gas than it is entitled to under its ownership percentage of total natural gas 13 production. any excess amount received above the company share is treated as a liability. if less than the company entitlement is received, the underproduction is recorded as a receivable. the company, directly or through its subsidiaries, from time to time, uses various derivative arrangements in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations. such arrangements include fixed price hedges, costless collars and other contractual arrangements. the company accounts for its derivative arrangements under statement of financial accounting standard ( sfas ) no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and has elected to designate its derivative arrangements as cash flow hedges. other significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment; valuation allowances for receivables, inventories and deferred income tax assets; environmental liabilities; valuation of derivative instruments; and assets and obligations related to employee benefits. actual results could differ from those estimates. management believes it is necessary to understand the company significant accounting policies, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this form 10-k/a. 18 costs and expenses crude oil and natural gas operations expense, consisting of lease operating expense, workover expenses, production taxes and other related lifting costs, was flat overall, in absolute dollars, in 2002 compared to 2001. in the north sea, operations expense increased 78 percent due to a full year of production operations from the hanze field and the commencement of operations from the hannay field in march 2002. in equatorial guinea, operations expense increased 45 percent due to the increased production from the alba field. domestic operations expense decreased in absolute terms during 2002 offsetting the international increases. crude oil and natural gas operations expense increased 10 percent overall in 2001 from 2000. in the north sea, operations expense increased 16 percent due to the commencement of operations of the hanze field in august 2001. in equatorial guinea, operations expense increased 61 percent due to the commencement of natural gas deliveries to the methanol plant in may 2001. included in operations expense were workover costs of $8.5 million, $15.1 million and $21.1 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. the workovers increased operations expense in such periods by $.04, $.07 and $.10 per mcfe, respectively. in 2002, dd&amp;a expense increased slightly compared to 2001. in the north sea, dd&amp;a expense increased 71 percent due to a full year production of the hanze field. in equatorial guinea, dd&amp;a expense increased 50 percent due to the results of the field expansion, which included a full year of natural gas sales to the methanol plant. the unit rate of dd&amp;a per boe was $7.92 in 2002. in 2001, dd&amp;a expense increased 23 percent overall compared to 2000. in the united states, dd&amp;a expense increased 22 percent due to increased development costs incurred in the gulf of mexico to stabilize production volumes. in the north sea, dd&amp;a expense increased 34 percent due to the commencement of production from the hanze field in august 2001. in equatorial guinea, dd&amp;a expense increased 186 percent due to the commencement of natural gas sales to the methanol plant in may 2001. the unit rate of dd&amp;a per boe was $7.70 in 2001. through december 31, 2002, the company provided for the cost of future liabilities related to restoration and dismantlement costs for offshore facilities. this provision is based on the company best estimate of such costs to be incurred in future years based on information from the company engineers. these estimated costs were provided through charging dd&amp;a expense using a ratio of production divided by reserves multiplied by the estimated costs to dismantle and restore. the company adopted sfas no. 143 on january 1, 2003 and will recognize, as the fair value of asset retirement obligations, $99.7 million related to the united states and $10.0 million related to the north sea. the company accumulated provision for future dismantlement and restoration cost was $84.1 million at december 31, 2002, $80.0 million at december 31, 2001 and $79.7 million at december 31, 2000. the company has not determined the cumulative effect of adoption of this standard. total estimated future dismantlement and restoration costs of $206.6 million, which consists of $188.7 million for the united states and $17.9 million for the north sea, are included in future production and development costs for purposes of estimating the future net revenues relating to the 19 company proved reserves. for more information, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the company is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations. management believes that the company is well positioned with its mix of crude oil and natural gas reserves to take advantage of future price increases that may occur. however, the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, the company, from time to time, has used derivative hedging instruments and may do so in the future as a means of managing its exposure to price changes. during 2002, the company entered into various natural gas costless collars, natural gas costless collar combinations and crude oil costless collar transactions related to its production. the table below depicts the various transactions for 2002. natural gas crude oil hedge mmbtupd 170,274 hedge bpd 5,247 floor price range $2.00 - $3.50 floor price range $23.00 - $24.00 ceiling price range $2.45 - $5.10 ceiling price range $29.30 - $30.10 percent of daily production 44 % percent of daily production 15 % gain (loss) per mcf $.03 gain (loss) per bbl $0 as of december 31, 2002, the company had entered into costless collars related to its natural gas and crude oil production to support the company investment program as follows: natural gas crude oil production period mmbtu per day price per mmbtu floor - ceiling bbls per day price per bbl floor - ceiling 1q 2003 185,000 $3.87 - $4.82 15,000 $23.00 - $28.63 2q 2003 185,000 $3.43 - $4.57 15,000 $23.00 - $28.63 3q 2003 185,000 $3.43 - $4.60 10,000 $23.00 - $27.95 4q 2003 185,000 $3.43 - $4.84 10,000 $23.00 - $27.95 23 the contracts entitle the company (floating price payor) to receive settlement from the counterparty (fixed price payor) for each calculation period in amounts, if any, by which the settlement price for the last scheduled nymex trading day applicable for each calculation period is less than the floor price. the company would pay the counterparty if the settlement price for the last scheduled nymex trading day applicable for each calculation period were more than the ceiling price. the amount payable by the floating price payor, if the floating price is above the ceiling price, is the product of the notional quantity per calculation period and the excess, if any, of the floating price over the ceiling price in respect of each calculation period. the amount payable by the fixed price payor, if the floating price is below the floor price, is the product of the notional quantity per calculation period and the excess, if any, of the floor price over the floating price in respect of each calculation period. during 2001, the company had natural gas costless collars for the fourth quarter of 2001 for 50,000 mmbtu of natural gas per day, with a floor price of $3.25 per mmbtu and a ceiling price of $4.60 per mmbtu. the net effect of this fourth quarter 2001 hedge was a $.02 per mcf increase in the average natural gas price for the year 2001. of the 50,000 mmbtu per day of costless collars, 25,000 mmbtu per day were terminated early, at a gain. as a result, the company recognized an additional $.70 per mmbtu on the 25,000 mmbtu of natural gas per day in 2001. nemi, from time to time, employs hedging arrangements in connection with its purchases and sales of production. while most of nemi purchases are made for an index-based price, nemi customers often require prices that are either fixed or related to nymex. in order to establish a fixed margin and mitigate the risk of price volatility, nemi may convert a fixed or nymex sale to an index-based sales price (such as by purchasing an index-based futures contract obligating nemi for delivery of production). due to the size of such transactions and certain restraints imposed by contract and by company guidelines, as of december 31, 2002, the company had no material market risk exposure from nemi hedging activity. the company has a $400 million credit agreement that exposes the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. the interest rate is based upon a eurodollar rate plus a range of 60 to 145 basis points depending upon the percentage of utilization and credit rating. at december 31, 2002, there was $380 million borrowed against this credit agreement with an interest rate of 2.47 percent and a maturity date of november 30, 2006. a ten percent change in the december 31, 2002 interest rate on this $380 million would result in a change in interest expense of $937,080. all other significant company long-term debt is fixed-rate and, therefore, does not expose the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. for more information, see financial statements and supplementary data note 4 - debt of this form 10-k/a. the company does not enter into foreign currency derivatives. the u.s. dollar is considered the primary currency for each of the company international operations. transactions that are completed in a foreign currency are translated into u.s. dollars and recorded in the financial statements. transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and the company does not believe it is currently exposed to any material risk of loss on this basis. such gains or losses are included in other income on the statement of operations. however, certain sales transactions are concluded in foreign currencies and the company, therefore, is exposed to potential risk of loss based on fluctuation in exchange rates from time to time. cautionary statement for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and other federal securities laws general. noble energy is including the following discussion to generally inform its existing and potential security holders of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect the company and to take advantage of the safe harbor protection for forward-looking statements afforded under federal securities laws. from time to time, the company management or persons acting on management behalf make forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about the company. these statements may include, but are not limited to, projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and the company future: (1) income, (2) crude oil and natural gas production, (3) crude oil and natural gas reserves and reserve replacement and (4) capital spending. 24 forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as estimate, project, predict, believe, expect, anticipate, plan, goal or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. sometimes the company will specifically describe a statement as being a forward-looking statement. in addition, except for the historical information contained in this form 10-k/a, the matters discussed in this form 10-k/a are forward-looking statements. these statements by their nature are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions and will be influenced by various factors. should any of the assumptions underlying a forward-looking statement prove incorrect, actual results could vary materially. noble energy believes the factors discussed below are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made herein or elsewhere by the company or on its behalf. the factors listed below are not necessarily all of the important factors. unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed herein could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of forward-looking statements. noble energy does not intend to update its description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises. the company advises its stockholders that they should: (1) be aware that important factors not described below could affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements, and (2) use caution and common sense when analyzing our forward-looking statements in this document or elsewhere. all of such forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. volatility and level of hydrocarbon commodity prices. historically, natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile. these prices rise and fall based on changes in market supply and demand fundamentals and changes in the political, regulatory and economic climates and other factors that affect commodities markets generally and are outside of noble energy control. some of noble energy projections and estimates are based on assumptions as to the future prices of natural gas and crude oil. these price assumptions are used for planning purposes. the company expects its assumptions may change over time and that actual prices in the future may differ from our estimates. any substantial or extended change in the actual prices of natural gas and/or crude oil could have a material effect on: (1) the company financial position and results of operations, (2) the quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that the company can economically produce, (3) the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to its properties, and (4) the company ability to fund its capital program. production rates and reserve replacement. projecting future rates of crude oil and natural gas production is inherently imprecise. producing crude oil and natural gas reservoirs generally have declining production rates. production rates depend on a number of factors, including geological, geophysical and engineering issues, weather, production curtailments or restrictions, prices for natural gas and crude oil, available transportation capacity, market demand and the political, economic and regulatory climates. another factor affecting production rates is noble energy ability to replace depleting reservoirs with new reserves through exploration success or acquisitions. exploration success is difficult to predict, particularly over the short term, where results can vary widely from year to year. moreover, the company ability to replace reserves over an extended period depends not only on the total volumes found, but also on the cost of finding and developing such reserves. depending on the general price environment for natural gas and crude oil, noble energy finding and development costs may not justify the use of resources to explore for and develop such reserves. reserve estimates. noble energy forward-looking statements are predicated, in part, on the company estimates of its crude oil and natural gas reserves. all of the reserve data in this form 10-k/a or otherwise made by or on behalf of the company are estimates. reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves. projecting future rates of production and timing of future development expenditures is also inexact. many factors beyond the company control affect these estimates. in addition, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. therefore, estimates made by different engineers may vary. the results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may also require a revision of that estimate, and these revisions may be material. as a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. 25 laws and regulations. noble energy forward-looking statements are generally based on the assumption that the legal and regulatory environments will remain stable. changes in the legal and/or regulatory environments could have a material effect on the company future results of operations and financial condition. noble energy ability to economically produce and sell crude oil, natural gas, methanol and power is affected by a number of legal and regulatory factors, including federal, state and local laws and regulations in the u.s. and laws and regulations of foreign nations, affecting: (1) crude oil and natural gas production, (2) taxes applicable to the company and/or its production, (3) the amount of crude oil and natural gas available for sale, (4) the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities, and (5) the marketing of competitive fuels. the company operations are also subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations in the u.s. and laws and regulations of foreign nations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. noble energy forward-looking statements are generally based upon the expectation that the company will not be required, in the near future, to expend cash to comply with environmental laws and regulations that are material in relation to its total capital expenditures program. however, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, the company is unable to accurately predict the ultimate financial impact of compliance. drilling and operating risks. noble energy drilling operations are subject to various risks common in the industry, including cratering, explosions, fires and uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas or well fluids. in addition, a substantial amount of the company operations are currently offshore, domestically and internationally, and subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as loop currents, capsizing, collision, and damage or loss from severe weather. the cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents and adverse weather conditions. competition. the company forward-looking statements are generally based on a stable competitive environment. competition in the industry is intense. noble energy actively competes for reserve acquisitions and exploration leases and licenses, for the labor and equipment required to operate and develop crude oil and natural gas properties and in the gathering and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, methanol and power. the company competitors include the major integrated oil companies, independent crude oil and natural gas concerns, individual producers, natural gas and crude oil marketers and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual consumers, many of whom have greater financial resources than the company. noble energy believes that the location of its properties, its expertise in exploration, drilling and production operations, the experience of its management and the efforts and expertise of its marketing units generally enable it to compete effectively. in making projections with respect to numerous aspects of the company business, noble energy generally assumes that there will be no material adverse change in competitive conditions. 26quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

noble energy spent approximately $1.2 million on the purchase of proved crude oil and natural gas properties. the company spent approximately $8.0 million in 2002 and $97.6 million in 2001 on the acquisition of proved properties. for more information, see item 2. properties crude oil and natural gas of this form 10-k. during 2003, noble energy spent approximately $10.2 million on acquisitions of unproved properties. the company spent approximately $30.6 million in 2002 and $81.3 million in 2001 on acquisitions of unproved properties. these properties were acquired primarily through various offshore lease sales, domestic onshore lease acquisitions and international concession negotiations. for more information, see item 2. properties crude oil and natural gas of this form 10-k. dispositions of oil and gas properties during 2003, the company identified five packages of non-core domestic properties to be sold. the properties held for disposition were reported as discontinued operations. overall, these properties represented approximately six percent of year-end reserves and nine percent of 2003 production. four of the five packages closed in 2003; the fifth 4 is scheduled to close in the first half of 2004. the company received $79.9 million from the sale of the four packages. the estimated reserves associated with these four packages were 17.2 mmboe. during 2002, the company sold approximately 4.1 mmboe of reserves and received approximately $20.4 million from the sale of properties. marketing nemi seeks opportunities to enhance the value of the company domestic natural gas production by marketing directly to end-users and aggregating natural gas to be sold to natural gas marketers and pipelines. during 2003, approximately 86 percent of nemi total sales were to end-users. nemi is also actively involved in the purchase and sale of natural gas from other producers. such third-party natural gas production may be purchased from non-operators who own working interests in the company wells or from other producers properties in which the company may not own an interest. nemi, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, noble gas pipeline, inc., engages in the installation, purchase and operation of natural gas gathering systems. noble energy has a short-term natural gas sales contract with nemi, whereby the company is paid an index price for all natural gas sold to nemi. the contract does not specify scheduled quantities or delivery points and expires on may 31, 2004. the company sold approximately 64 percent of its natural gas production to nemi in 2003. nemi revenues from sales of natural gas, including related derivative financial transactions, less cost of goods sold are reported in gmp. all intercompany sales and expenses are eliminated in the company consolidated financial statements. the company has a small number of long-term natural gas contracts representing approximately four percent of its 2003 natural gas sales. substantial competition in the natural gas marketplace continued in 2003. the company average natural gas price increased $1.24 from $2.89 per mcf in 2002 to $4.13 per mcf in 2003. due to the volatility of natural gas prices, the company, from time to time, has used derivative instruments and may do so in the future as a means of controlling its exposure to commodity price changes. for additional

company domestic natural gas production by marketing directly to end-users and aggregating natural gas to be sold to natural gas marketers and pipelines. during 2004, approximately 79 percent of nemi total sales were to end-users. nemi is also actively involved in the purchase and sale of natural gas from other producers. such third-party natural gas production may be purchased from non-operators who own working interests in the company wells or from other producers properties in which the company may not own an interest. nemi, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, noble gas pipeline, inc., engages in the installation, purchase and operation of natural gas gathering systems. noble energy has a long-term natural gas sales contract with nemi, whereby the company is paid an index price for all natural gas sold to nemi. the contract does not specify scheduled quantities or delivery points and expires on may 31, 2009. the company sold approximately 56 percent of its natural gas production to nemi in 2004. nemi revenues from sales of natural gas, including related derivative transactions, less cost of goods sold, are reported in gmp. all intercompany sales and expenses are eliminated in the company consolidated financial statements. the company has a small number of long-term natural gas contracts with third parties representing approximately 12 percent of its 2004 natural gas sales. substantial competition in the natural gas marketplace continued in 2004. the company average natural gas price from continuing operations, inclusive of the impact of commodity derivatives, increased $.61 from $4.13 per mcf in 2003 to $4.74 per mcf in 2004. due to the volatility of natural gas prices, the company has used derivative instruments and may do so in the future as a means of controlling its exposure to commodity price changes. for additional information, see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market

saltwater disposal and other related lifting costs. (2) other international includes ecuador, china, argentina and suriname. oil and gas operating costs increased $66 million, or 33%, from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of our expanded operations. three new deepwater gulf of mexico development projects came online between december 2005 and april 2006. fiscal year 2006 represented a full year of patina operations, and we acquired u.s. exploration on march 29, 2006. in addition, the current high commodity price environment has resulted in higher service, contract labor and fuel costs. insurance costs were also higher in 2006 due in part to increased rates for property damage coverage combined with the added costs of providing business interruption coverage on deepwater assets facing named windstorm exposure. oil and gas operating costs increased $67 million, or 49% from 2004 to 2005. the 2005 increase primarily reflects expenses associated with properties acquired in the patina merger. workover and repair expense increased $33 million during 2006 as compared with 2005 and decreased $3 million during 2005 as compared with 2004. expense for 2006 includes workover expense of $6 million associated with patina properties and $41 million associated with other north america properties. it also includes $30 million ($0.45 per boe) of hurricane-related repair expense. 51 production and ad valorem tax expense increased $30 million, or 38% during 2006 as compared with 2005 and increased $51 million, or almost tripled, during 2005 as compared with 2004. the 2006 increase reflects additional production from u.s. exploration properties and a full year of patina operations. patina and u.s. exploration properties have proportionately more production subject to such taxes. in addition, crude oil and natural gas revenues generally are taxed at higher rates as commodity prices rise. the 2005 increase primarily reflects increased production and higher realized commodity prices. selected expenses on a per boe basis were as follows: year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 oil and gas operating costs (1) $ 4.14 $ 3.94 $ 3.53 workover and repair expense (2) 0.72 0.27 0.43 lease operating expense 4.86 4.21 3.96 production and ad valorem taxes 1.67 1.52 0.73 transportation expense 0.44 0.33 0.51 total production costs $ 6.97 $ 6.06 $ 5.20 (1) includes domestic business interruption insurance of $0.21 per boe in 2006. (2) includes hurricane-related repair expense of $0.45 per boe in 2006. the unit rates of total production costs per boe, converting gas to oil on the basis of six mcf per barrel, have been increasing year-over-year since 2004. the increases are due to rising third-party costs, including insurance, hurricane-related repair expense, and higher production taxes. oil and gas exploration expense e

exploration expense decreased $11 million, or 6% during 2006 as compared with 2005, and increased $61 million, or 52%, during 2005 as compared with 2004. in 2006, u.s. dry hole expense was $30 million less due to the reduction in the number of dry holes drilled. u.s. seismic expense increased $18 million due primarily to the expansion of our deepwater regional 3d seismic database. in addition, other international staff expense increased $8 million due to new venture activity. exploration expense for 2006 included stock-based compensation expense of $1 million. the 2005 increase was due to higher dry hole expense in the u.s. where a total of 37 net wells were classified as dry holes and expensed during the year. depreciation, depletion and amortization expense dd&amp;a expense was as

increasing since 2004 primarily due to higher production volumes. the increase in the unit rate for 2006 as compared with 2005 was primarily due to the change in the mix of our production volumes. in particular, gulf of mexico deepwater production carries a unit rate which is higher than the company average. as deepwater production has increased from 3,627 boepd, or 3% of 2005 total consolidated production volumes to 25,432 boepd, or 14% of total consolidated production volumes in 2006, the unit rate has increased. during 2005, the unit rate decreased from 2004 due to an increase in low-cost production volumes in equatorial guinea and israel. dd&amp;a expense includes abandoned assets cost of $1 million, $11 million, and $15 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. general and

increase was due to higher salaries and wages and the inclusion of a full year of g&amp;a expense related to patina operations. we are experiencing wage inflation due to the tight labor market which has resulted from the current high commodity price environment. the 2005 increase reflects additional costs incurred relating to the combining of our operations with those of patina. g&amp;a expense for 2006 includes stock-based compensation expense of $11 million (calculated under sfas 123(r)). g&amp;a expense for 2005 and 2004 includes stock-based compensation expense (calculated under apb 25) of $4 million and $1 million, respectively. 53 g&amp;a includes actuarially-computed net periodic benefit expense related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $19 million, $11 million and $9 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. interest expense and capitalized interest interest expense and capitalized interest were as follows: year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) interest expense, net $ 117,045 $ 87,541 $ 53,460 capitalized interest 12,515 8,684 8,168 interest expense, net of capitalized interest, has been increasing due to additional borrowings related to the patina merger and acquisition of u.s. exploration and to increases in the interest rate applicable to the credit facility from 4.82% at december 31, 2005 to 5.69% at december 31, 2006. interest is capitalized on development projects using an interest rate equivalent to the average rate paid on long-term debt. capitalized interest is included in the cost of oil and gas assets and amortized with other costs on a unit-of-production basis. the majority of the capitalized interest in 2006 relates to long lead-time projects in the north sea and deepwater gulf of mexico. the majority of the capitalized interest in 2005 and 2004 relates to long lead-time projects in the deepwater gulf of mexico and internationally, primarily phase 2a in equatorial guinea.

we provide electricity only to meet peak demand. as seasonal rains subside, we experience increasing demand for thermal electricity. electricity generation expense includes $15 million, $11 million and $5 million net increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. these increases have been made to cover potentially uncollectible balances related to the ecuador power operations. certain entities purchasing electricity in ecuador have been slow to pay amounts due us. we are pursuing various strategies to protect our interests including international arbitration and litigation. gathering, marketing and processing nemi, a wholly-owned subsidiary, marketed approximately 43% of our domestic natural gas production in 2006, as well as certain third-party natural gas. nemi sells natural gas directly to end-users, natural gas marketers, industrial users, interstate and intrastate pipelines, power generators and local distribution companies. nemi also markets certain third-party crude oil. gathering, marketing and processing ( gmp ) proceeds are included in other revenues and gmp expenses are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. nemi gross margin from gmp activities was as follows: year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) gmp proceeds $ 27,876 $ 55,261 $ 49,250 gmp expenses 18,664 28,067 37,699 gross margin $ 9,212 $ 27,194 $ 11,551 nemi employs derivative instruments in connection with purchases and sales of third-party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to commodity price risk. most of the purchases made by nemi are on an index basis. however, purchasers in the markets in which nemi sells often require fixed or nymex-related pricing. nemi records gains and losses on derivative instruments using mark-to-market accounting. the net gain related to these contracts totaled $1 million during 2006 and $2 million during 2005. gains (losses) were de minimis for 2004. gmp proceeds for 2005, includes a gain of $11 million for the sale of certain gas sales and transportation contractual assets. deferred compensation expense in connection with the patina merger, we acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities related to a deferred compensation plan. the assets of the deferred compensation plan are held in a rabbi trust and include shares of our common stock. increases or decreases in the market value of the deferred compensation liability, including the shares of our common stock held by the rabbi trust, are included as deferred compensation expense and included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. we recorded deferred compensation expense of $28 million in 2006 and $18 million from the date of the patina merger through december 31, 2005. at december 31, 2006, 35% of the market value of the assets in the rabbi trust related to our common stock. 55 impairment of operating assets we recorded impairments of $9 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005, and $10 million in 2004, primarily related to downward reserve revisions on domestic properties. impairment expense is included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. income taxes the income tax provision was as follows: year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 income tax provision (in thousands) $ 417,789 $ 322,940 $ 199,158 effective rate 38 % 33 % 39 % several factors resulted in an increase in our effective tax rate for 2006. the major factor was the allocation of $100 million of nondeductible goodwill to the sale of the gulf of mexico shelf properties. at december 31, 2005, we had recorded a deferred u.s. tax asset of $55 million for the future foreign tax credits associated with deferred foreign tax liabilities recorded by our foreign branch operations. the valuation allowance with respect to the deferred u.s. tax asset was $41 million at december 31, 2005. the tax asset was decreased to $53 million during 2006, and the valuation allowance was increased to $53 million due to changes in the forecast of limitations on the ability to claim foreign tax credits. there was also an increase in the uk tax rate during 2006. the uk finance act of 2006, enacted on july 19, increased the income tax rate on our uk operations retroactive to january 1, 2006 and increased our income tax provision by approximately $9 million in 2006. partially offsetting these increases was a benefit from the realization of additional income from equity method investees which is a favorable permanent difference in calculating income tax expense. the decrease in the effective rate for 2005 was primarily due to our ability to claim a foreign tax credit for the income taxes paid by foreign branch operations, as well as to a benefit realized on the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004. see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 8 income taxes. discontinued operations during 2004, we completed an asset divestiture program including five domestic property packages. the sales price for the five property packages totaled $130 million. the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods previously presented to reflect the operations of the properties being sold as discontinued operations. summarized results of discontinued operations were as follows: year ended december 31, 2004 (in thousands) oil and gas sales and royalties $ 12,575 realized gain 14,996 income before income taxes 22,862 key statistics: daily production

price risk derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations. management believes that we are well positioned with our mix of crude oil and natural gas reserves to take advantage of future price increases that may occur. however, the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we have used derivative hedging instruments and may do so in the future as a means of managing our exposure to price changes. during the past three years we have entered into variable to fixed price swaps, costless collars, and variable to fixed price basis swaps related to our crude oil and natural gas production as follows: year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 natural gas collars nymex - hedge mmbtupd 12,082 79,932 120,284 floor price range $5.00 - $5.25 $5.00 - $5.75 $3.75 - $5.00 ceiling price range $8.00 -

for non-trading purposes we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes. at december 31, 2011, we had entered into variable to fixed price commodity swaps, two-way and three-way collars and basis swaps related to future crude oil and natural gas sales. our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net payable position with a fair value of $36 million. based on the december 31, 2011 published forward commodity price curves, a price increase of $1.00 per bbl for crude oil would increase the fair value of our net commodity derivative payable by approximately $18 million. a price increase of $0.10 per mmbtu for natural gas would increase the fair value of our net commodity derivative payable by approximately $6 million. our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. if we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net settled at the time of election. see
