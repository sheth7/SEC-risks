disclosures about market risk (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) metal price changes in the market price of gold and copper significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the relative strength of the u.s. dollar and global mine production levels. copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. foreign currency changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar may affect our profitability and cash flow. foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and u.s. currencies and u.s. and foreign country economic conditions. in addition to our operations in the united states, we have assets or operations in australia, peru, indonesia, canada, new zealand, ghana and mexico. our non-u.s. operations sell their metal production based on a u.s. dollar gold price. fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and costs applicable to sales per ounce to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate has had the greatest impact on our costs applicable to sales , as measured in u.s. dollars. however, variations in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate have historically been strongly correlated to variations in the u.s. dollar gold price over the long-term. increases or decreases in costs at australian gold operations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in u.s. dollars for such locations. no assurance can be given that the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the u.s. dollar gold price in the future, or that short-term changes in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on our profitability and cash flow. foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. however, if a sustained weakening of the u.s. dollar in relation to the australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the u.s. dollar gold price or by other factors, profitability, cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced. the extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the u.s. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. for information concerning the sensitivity of our costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see item 7, management discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations and financial condition-results of consolidated operations-foreign currency exchange rates, above. hedging our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in the gold and copper prices by selling our gold and copper production at current market prices. consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper sales. we continue to manage risks associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and foreign currencies using the derivative market. by using derivatives, we are affected by credit risk, market risk and market liquidity risk. credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. we mitigate credit risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of the counterparties. market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange 80 table of contents rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. we manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. we mitigate this risk by establishing trading agreements with counterparties under which we are not required to post any collateral or make any margin calls on our derivatives. our counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative. market liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing an offsetting position. under the terms of our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant breeches, including financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. we generally mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of our derivatives over time. cash flow hedges during the three years ended 2009, we entered into idr/$ fixed forward contracts to hedge a portion of our idr/$ operating expenditure exposure and $/a$ fixed forward contracts in other australia/new zealand and boddington to hedge a portion of our a$ operating expenditure exposure and our a$ capital expenditure exposure related to the construction of boddington. in 2008, we began a similar $/nz$ layered fixed forward contract program to hedge a portion of our nz$ denominated operating expenditures in other australia/new zealand. also in 2008, we implemented a program to hedge a portion of our operating cost exposure related to diesel prices of fuel consumed at our nevada operations. all of the currency and diesel contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of future expenditures, and as such, changes in the market value have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) . given that the fair value of our derivative instruments are based upon market rates and prices and that the volatility of these rates and prices are dependent on many factors subject to fluctuation, we are exposed to liquidity risks related to these contracts. we cash settle the fair value of each contract upon settlement with our counterparties. the settlement values of our contracts could differ significantly from the current fair values. as such, we are exposed to liquidity risk related to unfavorable changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts. we had the following derivative instruments designated as hedges with fair values at december 31, 2009

utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the variability of the us dollar amount of forecasted foreign currency expenditures caused by changes in currency exchange rates. we hedge a portion of our idr, a$, and nz$ denominated operating expenditures each period. the hedging instruments are fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to three years from the date of issue. the principal hedging objective is reduction in the volatility of realized period-on-period foreign exchange rates. beginning in 2010, we will not enter into any additional idr fixed forward contracts. we hedged our a$ denominated capital expenditures related to the construction of boddington. the hedging instruments consisted of a series of fixed forward contracts and bought call option contracts with expiration dates ranging up to one year from the date of issue. the $30 net realized loss associated with the capital expenditure hedge program was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) net of tax and will be recognized in amortization over the life of the related boddington assets. at december 31, 2009, the company had no outstanding hedges for the boddington capital program. all of the foreign currency contracts were designated as cash flow hedges, and as such, the effective portion of unrealized changes in market value have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recorded in earnings during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current

proceeds realized from the bond issuances. the treasury rate locks resulted in $6 and $5 unrealized gains for the 2019 and 2039 notes, respectively. we previously acquired treasury rate locks in connection with the issuance of the 2035 notes that resulted in a $10 unrealized loss. the gains/losses from these contracts are recognized in interest expense, net over the terms of the respective notes. fair value hedges interest rate risk at december 31, 2009, we had $222 fixed to floating swap contracts designated as a hedge against our 8 5 / 8 % senior notes. the interest rate swap contracts assist in management of our targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt. under the hedge contract terms, we receive fixed-rate interest 83 table of contents payments at 8.63% and pay floating-rate interest amounts based on periodic london interbank offered rate ( libor ) settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 7.63%. the interest rate swap contracts were designated as fair value hedges and, as such, changes in fair value have been recorded in income in each period, consistent with recording changes to the mark-to-market value of the underlying hedged liability in income. changes in the mark-to-market value of the effective portion of the interest rate swap contracts are recognized as a component of interest expense, net. the hedge contracts decreased interest expense, net by $4, $2 and $nil during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. during 2009, 2008 and 2007, losses of $3 and gains of $4 and $3 were included in other income, net for the ineffective portion of these swap contracts designated as fair value hedges, respectively. commodity price risk lme copper prices averaged $2.34 per pound during 2009, compared with our recorded average provisional price of $2.53 per pound before mark-to-market gains and treatment and refining charges. the applicable forward copper price at the end of the year was $3.34 per pound. during 2009, increasing copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of $173 ($0.33 per pound). at december 31, 2009, we had copper sales of 160 million pounds priced at an average of $3.34 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. the average london p.m. gold fix was $973 per ounce during 2009, compared with our recorded average provisional gold price of $977 per ounce before mark-to-market gains and treatment and refining charges. the applicable forward gold price at the end of the year was $1,094 per ounce. during 2009, changes in gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of $15 ($2 per ounce). at december 31, 2009, we had gold sales of 85,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,094 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months. fixed and variable rate debt we have both fixed and variable rate debt. 93% and 66% of debt was fixed and 7% and 34% was variable at december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. fixed debt increased primarily due to the issuance of the 2012, 2019 and 2039 notes, which had a combined carrying value of $2,446 at december 31, 2009. variable rate debt decreased primarily due to the decreased borrowings on the corporate revolving credit facility, which was $nil and $757 at december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. we have managed some of our fixed rate debt exposure by entering into interest rate swaps (see interest rate swap contracts above). our fixed rate debt exposure at december 31, 2009 and 2008 is summarized as follows: 2009 2008 carrying value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 4,146 $ 1,961 fair value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 4,470 $ 1,909 pro forma fair value sensitivity of fixed rate debt of a +/ 10 basis point interest rate change (2) $ +/ 38 $ +/ 8 (1) excludes specialized and hybrid debt instruments for which it is not practicable to estimate fair values and pro forma fair values or sensitivities. these instruments include the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant, ptnnt project financing facility, yanacocha project financing and certain capital leases. the estimated fair value quoted above may or may not reflect the actual trading value of these instruments. (2) the pro forma information assumes a +/ 10 basis point change in market interest rates at december 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions. 84 table of contentsquantitative and

provisional copper and gold sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. the host contract is the receivable from the sale of the gold and copper concentrates at the prevailing indices prices at the time of sale. the embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each

we had gold sales of 105,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,411 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months. each $10 change in the price for provisionally priced gold sales would have an approximate $1 effect on our net income attributable to newmont stockholders . fixed and variable rate debt we have both fixed and variable rate debt. 99% and 93% of our debt portfolio was fixed rate debt at december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. the carrying value of fixed rate debt increased primarily due to note discount amortization. variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt decreased primarily due to the full repayment of the ptnnt project financing facility of $219, yanacocha credit facility of $62, and yanacocha senior notes of $100. we may manage our fixed

$33. the maximum period over which hedged forecasted transactions are expected to occur is 3 years. foreign currency contracts we entered into a series of foreign currency contracts to hedge the variability of the us dollar amount of forecasted foreign currency expenditures caused by changes in currency rates. we entered into idr/$ forward purchase contracts to hedge up to 80% of our idr denominated operating expenditures which results in a blended idr/$ rate realized each period. the hedges are forward purchase contracts with expiration dates ranging up to one year from the date of issue which increased batu hijau costs applicable to sales by $2 in 2008, and reduced batu hijau costs applicable to sales by $4 and $11 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. as of december 31, 2008, we have hedged 31% of our expected 2009 idr operating expenditures. during the third quarter of 2007, we began a multi-year systematic, disciplined layered program to hedge up to 85% of our a$ denominated operating expenditures with forward contracts that have expiration dates ranging up to three years from the date of issue. the principal hedging objective is reduction in the volatility of realized period-on-period $/a$ rates. each month, fixed forward contracts are obtained to hedge 1/36th of the forecasted monthly a$ operating cost exposure in the rolling three-year hedge period resulting in a blended $/a$ rate realized. during 2008 and 2007, the a$ operating hedge program increased australia/new zealand costs applicable to sales by $13 and reduced australia/new zealand costs applicable to sales by $1, respectively. as of december 31, 2008, we have hedged 66%, 38% and 12% of our expected 2009, 2010 and 2011 a$ operating expenditures, respectively, which includes our 66.67% ownership in boddington. during the first quarter of 2008, we began a multi-year systematic, disciplined layered program to hedge up to 75% of our nz$ denominated operating expenditures with forward contracts that have expiration dates ranging up to two years from the date of issue. the principal hedging objective is reduction in the volatility of realized period-on-period $/nz$ rates. each month, fixed forward contracts are obtained to hedge 1/24th of the forecasted monthly nz$ operating cost exposure in the rolling two-year hedge period resulting in a blended $/nz$ rate realized. during 2008, the nz$ operating hedge program increased australia/new zealand costs applicable to sales by $2. as of december 31, 2008, we have hedged 53% and 20% of our expected 2009 and 2010 nz$ operating expenditures, respectively. during the fourth quarter of 2007, we began a program to hedge up to 95% of our a$ denominated capital expenditures related to the construction of boddington. the program consists of 83 table of contents a series of fixed forward contracts and bought call option contracts with expiration dates ranging up to one year from the date of issue. the realized gains and losses associated with the capital expenditure hedge program will impact amortization during future periods in which boddington assets are placed into service and affect earnings. as of december 31, 2008, we have hedged 83% of our remaining a$ denominated boddington capital expenditures for our 66.67% ownership. we had the following foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at

hedge up to 66% of our operating cost exposure related to diesel prices of fuel consumed at our nevada operations. the program consists of a series of financially settled fixed forward contracts with expiration dates of up to one year from the date of issue. during 2008, the nevada diesel hedge program increased nevada costs applicable to sales by $4. as of december 31, 2008, we have hedged 34% of our expected 2009 nevada diesel expenditures. 84 table of contents we had the following diesel derivative contracts outstanding at december 31, 2008: expected maturity date fair value total/ at

hedge against a portion of our 8 5 / 8 % debentures. under the hedge contract terms, we receive fixed-rate interest payments at 8.625% and pay floating-rate interest amounts based on periodic london interbank offered rate ( libor ) settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 3.49%. the hedge contracts decreased interest expense, net of capitalized interest by $2, $nil and $nil for the years ended december 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. at december 31, 2008, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was $9, of which $2 was included in other current assets and $7 was included in other long-term assets . at december 31, 2007, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was $4, all of which was included in other long-term assets . provisional copper and gold sales under the long-established structure of sales agreements prevalent in the industry, substantially all of our copper and gold concentrate sales are provisionally priced at the time of shipment. the provisional prices are finalized in a contractually specified future period (generally one to five months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted lme prices (copper) and the london p.m. fix (gold). sales subject to final pricing are generally settled in a subsequent month or quarter. because a significant portion of our copper and gold concentrate sales in any quarterly period usually remain subject to final pricing, the quarter-end forward price is a major determinant of recorded revenues and the average recorded copper price for the period. lme copper prices averaged $3.16 per pound during 2008, compared with our recorded average provisional price of $3.03 per pound. the applicable forward copper price at the end of 2008 was $1.39 per pound. during 2008, declining copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of $48. at december 31, 2008, we had copper sales of 82 million pounds priced at an average of $1.39 per pound, subject to final pricing in the first quarter of 2009. the lme closing settlement price for copper on february 11, 2009 was $1.53 per pound. assuming that the february 11, 2009 year-to-date average pricing of $1.48 per pound and average forward price of $1.59 per pound were applied to the december 31 provisionally priced sales, the weighted-average price for these sales would be approximately $1.51 per pound and would result in an increase to first-quarter 2009 revenues of approximately $10. the average london p.m. fix was $872 per ounce during 2008, compared with our recorded average provisional price of $874 per ounce. the applicable forward gold price at the end of 2008 was $883 per ounce. during 2008, changes in gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of $2. at december 31, 2008, we had gold sales of 9,000 ounces priced at an average of $883 per ounce, subject to final pricing in january 2009. the london p.m. fix on january 30, 2009 was $920 per ounce and the january 30, 2009 year-to-date average pricing was $859 per ounce. the change in the price for the provisionally priced sales at december 31, 2008 will have an insignificant effect on first quarter 2009 revenues. 85 table of contents price-capped forward sales contracts in june 2007, we paid $578 to settle all of the 1.85 million ounce price-capped forward sales contracts which were accounted for as normal sales contracts under fas 133 and fasb statement no. 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities-an amendment to fasb statement no. 133. we reported a $531 pre-tax loss on the early settlement of the contracts, after a $47 reversal of previously recognized deferred revenue in 2007. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. copper collar contracts during 2006, we entered into copper collar contracts to hedge the copper price realized during those periods. final delivery under the copper collar contracts occurred in february 2007. as of december 31, 2006, approximately 13 million pounds of copper were hedged by the copper collar contracts, which had been designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted copper sales. as such, changes in the fair value related to the effective portion of the hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income . fixed and variable rate debt we have both fixed and variable rate debt. 66% and 86% of debt was fixed and 34% and 14% was variable as of december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. we have managed some of our fixed rate debt exposure by entering into interest rate swaps (see interest rate swap contracts above). our fixed rate debt exposure as of december 31, 2008 and 2007 is summarized as follows: 2008 2007 carrying value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 1,961 $ 1,965 fair value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 1,909 $ 2,206 pro forma fair value sensitivity of fixed rate debt of a +/ 10 basis point interest rate change (2) $ +/ 8.4 $ +/ 10.8 (1) excludes specialized and hybrid debt instruments for which it is not practicable to estimate fair values and pro forma fair values or sensitivities. these instruments include the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant, ptnnt project financing facility, yanacocha project financing and certain capital leases. the estimated fair value quoted above may or may not reflect the actual trading value of these instruments. (2) the pro forma information assumes a +/ 10 basis point change in market interest rates as of december 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions. 86 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 110 metal price 110 foreign currency 110 hedging 111 fixed rate debt 115 pension and other benefit plans 115 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk metal price changes in the market price of gold significantly affect newmont profitability and cash flow. gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; and global mine production levels. based on estimates of newmont stand-alone 2004 production and expenses, a $10-per-ounce change in the gold price would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $55 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $50 million in net income. changes in the market price of copper also affect newmont profitability and cash flow from its investment in the batu hijau mine in indonesia and its golden grove mine in australia. copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. based on estimates of newmont stand-alone 2004 production and expenses, a $0.10-per-pound change in the copper price would result in an increase or decrease in net income of approximately $25.2 million (about $0.06 per share). foreign currency changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar may affect newmont profitability and cash flow. foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and u.s. currencies and u.s. and foreign country economic conditions. in addition to its operations in the united states, newmont has operations in australia, peru, indonesia, canada, uzbekistan, turkey, bolivia, new zealand and mexico. the company non-u.s. operations sell their metal production based on a u.s. dollar gold price. fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and total cash costs per ounce to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. since the company february 15, 2002 acquisition of normandy, the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate has had the greatest impact on the company total cash costs, as measured in u.s. dollars. however, variations in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate have historically been strongly correlated to variations in the u.s. dollar gold price over the long-term. increases or decreases in costs at australian gold operations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in u.s. dollars for such locations. no assurance can be given that the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the u.s. dollar gold price in the future, or that 110 table of contents short-term changes in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on the company profitability and cash flow. newmont does not believe that foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar have had a material impact on its determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. however, in the event that a sustained weakening of the u.s. dollar in relation to the australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact the company cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the u.s. dollar gold price or by other factors, the company believes that profitability, cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced. the extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the u.s. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. based on estimates of newmont stand-alone 2004 production and expenses, a $0.01 change in the australian dollar exchange would result in an increase or decrease in total cash costs of approximately $0.85 per ounce. for information concerning the sensitivity of the company cash costs to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see item 7, management discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations and financial condition results of operations foreign currency exchange rates, above. hedging newmont generally sells its production at prevailing market prices. newmont has historically, on a limited basis, entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold production and to manage risks associated with sales contracts, commodities, interest rates and foreign currency. in addition, at the time of normandy acquisition, three of normandy affiliates had a substantial derivative instrument position. these three affiliates are now known as newmont gold treasury pty ltd ( ngt ), newmont nfm, and newmont yandal operations pty ltd ( nyol ). following the normandy acquisition, however, and in accordance with the company unhedged philosophy, efforts to proactively reduce and simplify the normandy hedge positions have been undertaken. accordingly, the normandy gold hedge books have been reduced by approximately 9.4 million ounces since february 2002. gold forward sales contracts and other committed hedging obligations were reduced by 7,547,000 ounces since february 15, 2002 by delivering production into the contracts or through early close outs. similarly, uncommitted contracts for 1,870,000 ounces were either delivered into, lapsed or closed out early. thus, as of december 31, 2003, the newmont nfm gold hedge book has been eliminated, and the ngt gold hedge book has been reduced to zero committed ounces and 528,000 uncommitted ounces. in addition, on may 28, 2003, a wholly-owned subsidiary of newmont offered to acquire all of nyol gold hedge obligations from nyol counterparties. six of seven of these counterparties accepted this offer, receiving $0.50 for each dollar of net mark-to-market liability under their individual hedge contracts, calculated as of may 22, 2003. on july 3, 2003, nyol was placed into voluntary administration (a form of australian insolvency proceeding). on september 10, 2003, nyol emerged from the voluntary administration process, remaining a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of newmont, following acceptance by nyol creditors of an offer from another newmont subsidiary that effectively valued the assets of nyol at more than $200 million. acceptance of this offer by nyol creditors had the effect of extinguishing nyol hedge contract liability. the mark-to-market valuation of the normandy gold hedge book at december 31, 2003, was approximately negative $12 million residing in the entity ngt. this valuation compares to the negative mark-to-market valuation of the normandy gold hedge books at december 31, 2002 broken down as follows: ngt: $122 million; newmont nfm: $23 million; and, nyol: $288 million. newmont is not required to place collateral with respect to commodity instruments and there are no margin calls associated with such contracts. counterparty credit risk is minimized by dealing only with major financial institutions/counterparties. gold commodity contracts the tables below are expressed in thousands of ounces of gold, and prices for contracts denominated in a$ have been translated to u.s.$ at the exchange rate at december 31, 2003 of u.s.$0.75

into transactions that closed out certain call options. the call options were replaced with a series of forward sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. under the terms of the contracts, newmont will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price ranging from $350 per ounce in 2005 to $392 per ounce in 2011. the fair value of the forward sales contracts of $53.8 million was recorded as deferred revenue and will be included in sales revenue as delivery occurs in 2005 through 2011. the forward sales contracts are accounted for as normal sales contracts under sfas 133. newmont had the following price-capped forward sales contracts outstanding at december 31, 2003: expected maturity

u.s.$ bonds were swapped into gold-denominated payments of 600,000 ounces in 2008. newmont australia also received u.s.$ fixed interest payments and paid gold lease rates, which were indexed to market rates. this instrument was marked to market at each period end, with the change reflected in income until the contract was closed out during the nyol buy back transaction (see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). however, the indexed portion of the transaction was held by the one counterparty, which did not take up the offer. this position was extinguished as part of the nyol voluntary administration process (see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). the fair value of this instrument at december 31, 2002 was a negative $87.2 million. other sales contracts, commodity and derivative instruments foreign currency . in addition to the united states, newmont has operations in australia, peru, indonesia, canada, uzbekistan, turkey, bolivia, new zealand and mexico. to the extent that there are fluctuations in local currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar, the devaluation of a local currency is generally economically neutral or beneficial to most operations since local salaries and supply contracts will decrease against the u.s. dollar based revenue stream. the appreciation of non-u.s. dollar currencies against the u.s. dollar can increase 113 table of contents the costs of gold production in u.s. dollar terms at mines located outside the united states, making such mines less profitable. foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) were approximately $97.0 million, $14.0 million and $(5.1) million for the years ended december 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. the year ended december 31, 2003 included a foreign currency translation gain of $97.0 million primarily composed of the following: (i) exchange gains, net of $58.9 million on canadian dollar-denominated intercompany loans with a subsidiary whose functional currency is the canadian dollar, reflecting a strengthening of the canadian dollar during the period from $0.63 to $0.77 per u.s. dollar, (ii) a $27.4 million mark-to-market gain on ineffective foreign currency swaps, (iii) a $27.9 million foreign currency loss on the translation of newmont australia limited financial statements to u.s. dollars due to appreciation of the australian dollar from $0.56 to $0.75 and (iv) other foreign currency gains of $38.6 million. as of december 31, 2003, the company converted a substantial portion of the canadian denominated intercompany loans to long-term notes, as the company does not intend to settle these loans in the foreseeable future. as a result, the company will no longer record foreign currency gains and loses in earnings with respect to the converted long-term notes. newmont acquired certain cross currency swap contracts in the normandy transaction intended to hedge the currency risk on repayment of u.s. dollar-denominated debt. these contracts were closed out during the quarter ended june 30, 2002 for net proceeds of $50.8 million. the contracts were accounted for on a mark-to-market basis until closed out, resulting in a loss to income of $8.5 million for the period from february 15, 2002 through december 31, 2002. newmont also acquired currency swap contracts to receive australian dollars and pay u.s. dollars designated as hedges of a$-denominated debt. the a$-denominated debt was repaid during the quarter ended june 30, 2002 and the contracts are currently undesignated. the contracts are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis with the change recorded in earnings. at december 31, 2003, newmont had the following foreign currency contracts outstanding. prices for contracts

debentures and its $200 million 8.375% debentures, (see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). these transactions resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $6.9 million, $5.9 million and $0.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. the fair value of the derivative assets was $5.3 million at december 31, 2003 and the fair value of the hedge portion was $7.7 million and $16.9 million at december 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 114 table of contents fixed rate debt newmont has both fixed and variable rate debt. without considering the specialized $145 million prepaid forward sales obligation , 94% and 82% of debt was fixed and 6% and 18% was variable at december 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the company has managed some of its fixed rate debt exposure by entering into interest rate swaps (see interest rate swap contracts above). the company fixed rate debt exposure at december 31, 2003 and 2002 is summarized as follows: 2003 2002 (in millions) carrying value of fixed rate debt* $ 569 $ 976 fair value of fixed rate debt* $ 639 $ 1,075 pro forma fair value sensitivity of fixed rate debt of a +/ 10 basis point interest

include the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant, prepaid forward sales obligation, yanacocha trust certificates and certain capital leases. the estimated fair value quoted above may or may not reflect the actual trading value of these instruments. ** the pro forma information assumes a +/ 10 basis point change in market interest rates at december 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions. pension and other benefit plans pension and other benefit plan costs can be impacted by actual results that differ from assumptions selected. these differences are reflected in financial results over future periods. actual returns (losses) on pension assets were $29.4 million, $(11.1) million and $0.9 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, compared to expected returns of $12.1 million, $14.4 million and $15.5 million for the same periods. if the difference between expected returns and actual results related to plan assets, combined with the gains or losses resulting from the projected benefit obligation, fall outside certain limits, the difference will be amortized into future earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining working life of

plan employs two independent multi-product investment firms who invest the assets of the plan in certain approved funds that correspond to the specific asset classes and associated target allocations designated by the board of directors of the company. depending upon actual sector performance, the assets in the plan are periodically rebalanced to match the established target levels for the asset classes. this rebalancing may be accomplished through actual transfer of funds between asset classes and managers, or through targeted cash contributions and/or distributions. the goal of the pension fund investment program is to achieve expected rates of return consistent with the investment risk associated with the approved investment portfolio. the investment performance of the plan and that of the individual investment firms is measured against recognized market indices. this performance is monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of the company management, which in turn, is advised by an independent investment consultant. the performance of the plan is 115 table of contents reviewed annually with the audit committee of the company board of directors. contributions to the pension plans were $24.9 million, $12.3 million and $11.3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. funding in 2004 is expected to be approximately $38 million. a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate assumptions (to 6.00%) would increase pension expense by $1.4 million and other benefits expense $0.5 million for 2004 if such a rate had been determined as the appropriate rate to use. such a change would have no impact on future pension funding requirements.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 91 metal price 91 foreign currency 92 hedging 92 fixed rate debt 94 pension and other benefit plans 95 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk metal price changes in the market price of gold significantly affect newmont profitability and cash flow. gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the strength of the u.s. dollar and global mine production levels. changes in the market price of copper also affect newmont profitability and cash flow from its investment in the batu hijau mine in indonesia and its golden grove mine in australia. copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. 91 table of contents foreign currency changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar may affect newmont profitability and cash flow. foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and u.s. currencies and u.s. and foreign country economic conditions. in addition to its operations in the united states, newmont has operations in australia, peru, indonesia, canada, uzbekistan, bolivia, new zealand and mexico. the company non-u.s. operations sell their metal production based on a u.s. dollar gold price. fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and total cash costs per ounce to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. since the company february 15, 2002 acquisition of normandy, the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate has had the greatest impact on the company total cash costs, as measured in u.s. dollars. however, variations in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate have historically been strongly correlated to variations in the u.s. dollar gold price over the long-term. increases or decreases in costs at australian gold operations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in u.s. dollars for such locations. no assurance can be given that the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the u.s. dollar gold price in the future, or that short-term changes in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on the company profitability and cash flow. newmont does not believe that foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar have had a material impact on its determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. however, in the event that a sustained weakening of the u.s. dollar in relation to the australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact the company cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the u.s. dollar gold price or by other factors, the company believes that profitability, cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced. the extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the u.s. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. for information concerning the sensitivity of the company cash costs to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see item 7, management discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations and financial condition results of operations foreign currency exchange rates, above. hedging newmont generally avoids hedging. newmont philosophy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes to gold prices by selling its gold production at market prices. newmont has, on a limited basis, entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold and copper production and to manage risks associated with sales contracts, commodities, interest rates, and foreign currency. newmont is not required to place collateral with respect to commodity instruments and there are no margin calls associated with such contracts. during the year ended december 31, 2004, newmont entered into copper option collar contracts, u.s.$/idr forward purchase contracts and australian dollar net zero-cost option collar contracts. approximately 459 million pounds of copper are hedged by the copper option collar contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted copper sales, and as such, changes in the fair value related to the effective portion of the hedges have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income . the remainder of the copper option collar contracts are currently undesignated and are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis currently through earnings. the u.s.$/idr forward purchase contracts and australian dollar net zero-cost option collar contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of future idr and australian dollar expenditures, respectively, and as such, changes in the market value have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income . for the years ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, a net gain of $2.3 million, $28.3 million and a net loss of $18.3 million, respectively, were included in net income for the ineffective portion of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and a net loss of zero million, $5.4 million and a net loss of $21.5 million, respectively, for the change in fair value of gold commodity contracts that do not qualify as hedges (included in gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net ). the amount to be reclassified from accumulated other

forward contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2004, although a position did exist as of december 31, 2003. these positions were closed during july 2004. the fair value of these contracts as of december 31, 2003 was positive $7.7 million. provisional copper and gold sales for the years ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, batu hijau recorded gross revenues, before smelting and refining charges, of $324.8 million, $95.7 million and $65.7 million for base metals, respectively, and $28.5 million, zero and zero for gold, respectively, which were subject to final pricing adjustments. the 93 table of contents average realized price adjustment for base metals was 13.77%, 5.07% and 1.98% for the years ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and 0.86%, 1.13% and 0.83% for gold for the same periods. price-capped sales contracts in 2001, newmont entered into transactions that closed out certain call options. the options were replaced with a series of forward sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. under the terms of the contracts, newmont will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price ranging from $350 per ounce in 2005 to $392 per ounce in 2011. the initial fair value of the forward sales contracts of $53.8 million was recorded as deferred revenue from sale of future production and will be included in sales revenue as delivery occurs in 2005 through 2011. as of december 31, 2004, the current portion of $7.0 million has been reclassified to other current liabilities . the forward sales contracts are accounted for as normal sales contracts under sfas no. 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no. 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities-an amendment to sfas no. 133. newmont had the following price-capped forward sales contracts outstanding at december 31,

and its $200 million 8 3 / 8 % debentures. the company receives fixed-rate interest payments at 8.625% or 8.375% and pays floating-rate interest amounts based on periodic london interbank offered rate ( libor ) settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 4.25%. the notional principal amount of these transactions was $200 million at december 31, 2004. effective april 1, 2004, the company redesignated $150 million of these contracts as new fair value hedges against portions of the 8 5 / 8 % notes and 8 3 / 8 % debentures. the remaining $50 million of these contracts have not been designated and changes in their fair value are recorded currently in income. half of these contracts expire in july 2005 and half expire in may 2011. these transactions resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $5.5 million, $6.9 million and $5.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the fair value of the ineffective portions accounted for as derivative assets were $3.7 million and $5.2 million at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and the fair value of the effective portions accounted for as fair value hedges were $5.0 million and $7.7 million at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. fixed rate debt newmont has both fixed and variable rate debt. without considering the specialized $145 million prepaid forward sales obligation , 48% and 94% of debt was fixed and 52% and 6% was variable at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. the company has managed some of its fixed rate debt exposure by entering into interest rate swaps (see interest rate swap contracts above). the company fixed rate debt exposure at december 31, 2004 and 2003 is summarized as follows: 2004 2003 (in millions) carrying value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 414 $ 569 fair value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 463 $ 639 pro forma fair value sensitivity of fixed rate debt of a +/ 10 basis point interest rate change (2) $ +/ 1.4 $ +/ 2.2 94 table of contents (1) excludes specialized and hybrid debt instruments for which it is not practicable to estimate fair values and pro forma fair values or sensitivities. these instruments include the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant, prepaid forward sales obligation, ptnnt project financing facility, ptnnt partner loan and certain capital leases. the estimated fair value quoted above may or may not reflect the actual trading value of these instruments. (2) the pro forma information assumes a +/ 10 basis point change in market interest rates at december 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions. pension and other benefit plans pension and other benefit plan costs can be impacted by actual results that differ from assumptions selected. these differences are reflected in financial results over future periods. actual returns (losses) on pension assets were $19.3 million, $29.4 million and $(11.1) million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, compared to expected returns of $13.5 million, $12.1 million and $14.4 million for the same periods. if the difference between expected returns and actual results related to plan assets, combined with the gains or losses resulting from the projected benefit obligation, fall outside certain limits, the difference will be amortized into future earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining working life of the participants (currently 13.8 years). the following table

plans were $12, $38 and $22 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. the company is currently planning to contribute at a minimum, $30, to its retirement benefit programs in 2006. however, during the course of the year, consideration may be given to making additional contributions toward the company retirement benefit programs depending on various factors, including changes to regulations governing the funding of pensions, the company business and operating environment and forecasted cash flows. 80 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 77 metal

fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and u.s. currencies and u.s. and foreign country economic conditions. in addition to its operations in the united states, newmont has operations in australia, peru, indonesia, canada, uzbekistan, bolivia, new zealand and mexico. the company non-u.s. operations sell their metal production based on a u.s. dollar gold price. fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and total cash costs per ounce to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. since the company february 15, 2002 acquisition of normandy, the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate has had the greatest impact on the company total cash costs, as measured in u.s. dollars. however, variations in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate have historically been strongly correlated to variations in the u.s. dollar gold price over the long-term. increases or decreases in costs at australian gold operations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in u.s. dollars for such locations. no assurance can be given that the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the u.s. dollar gold price in the future, or that short-term changes in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on the company profitability and cash flow. foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar have not had a material impact on newmont determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. however, if a sustained weakening of the u.s. dollar in relation to the australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact the company cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the u.s. dollar gold price or by other factors, profitability, cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced. the extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the u.s. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. for information concerning the sensitivity of the company cash costs to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see item 7, management discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations and financial condition-results of operations-foreign currency exchange rates, above. hedging newmont generally avoids hedging its gold production. newmont philosophy is to provide shareholders with leverage to gold prices by selling its gold production at market prices. newmont has, entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold and copper production and to manage risks associated with sales contracts, commodities, interest rates, and foreign currency. newmont is not required to place collateral with respect to derivative contracts and there are no margin calls associated with such contracts. during 2005, newmont entered into copper net zero-cost option collar contracts and $/idr forward purchase contracts. as of december 31, 2005, approximately 360 million pounds of copper are hedged by the copper option collar contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted copper sales, and as such, changes in the fair value related to the effective portion of the hedges have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income . approximately 130 million pounds of the copper option collar contracts are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis currently through earnings. the $/idr forward purchase contracts and australian 77 table of contents dollar net zero-cost option collar contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of future idr and australian dollar expenditures, respectively, and as such, changes in the market value have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income . for 2005, 2004 and 2003, net gains of $2, $2 and $28, respectively, were included in net income for the ineffective portion of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and a net loss of $5 for 2003, for the change in fair value of gold commodity contracts that do not qualify as hedges (included in gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net ). the amount to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , net of tax to income for derivative instruments during the next 12 months is a gain of approximately $41. the maximum period over which hedged forecasted transactions are expected to occur is 6 years. certain hedge positions were eliminated in connection with the voluntary administration of newmont yandal operations pty ltd.

(2) the pro forma information assumes a +/ 10 basis point change in market interest rates at december 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions. pension and other benefit plans pension and other benefit plan costs can be impacted by actual results that differ from assumptions selected. these differences are reflected in financial results over future periods. actual returns on pension assets were $18, $19 and $29 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, compared to expected returns of $21, $14 and $12 for the same periods. if the difference between expected returns and actual results related to plan assets, combined with the gains or losses resulting from the projected benefit obligation, fall outside certain limits, the difference will be amortized into future earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining working life of the participants (currently 13.7 years). the following table provides details of the pension plans asset mix at december 31, 2005:

specific asset classes with associated target allocations. depending upon actual sector performance, the assets in the plan are periodically rebalanced to match the established target levels for the asset classes. this rebalancing may be accomplished through actual transfer of funds between asset classes and managers, or through targeted cash contributions and/or distributions. the goal of the pension fund investment program is to achieve expected rates of return consistent with the investment risk associated with the approved investment portfolio. the investment performance of the plan and that of the individual investment firms is measured against recognized market indices. this performance is monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of the company management, which in turn, is advised by an independent investment consultant. the performance of the plan is reviewed annually with the audit committee of the company board of directors. contributions to the pension plans were $12, $38 and $22 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. the company is currently planning to contribute at a minimum, $30, to its retirement benefit programs in 2006. however, during the course of the year, consideration may be given to making additional contributions toward the company retirement benefit programs depending on various factors, including changes to regulations governing the funding of pensions, the company business and operating environment and forecasted cash flows. 80 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 77 metal

other benefit plans as of december 31, 2006, the company adopted the provisions of fasb statement no. 158, employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no. 87, 88, 106, and 132(r) ( fas 158 ). fas 158 required employers that sponsor one or more defined benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position, (ii) recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position, and (iv) disclose in the notes to the financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. the impact of adopting fas 158 on the consolidated balance sheets was as follows: before application of fas 158 adjustment after application of fas 158 other long-term assets $ 193 $ (15 ) $ 178 total assets $ 15,616 $ (15 ) $ 15,601 employee pension and other benefits $ 229 $ 27 $ 256 deferred income taxes $ 717 $ (14 ) $ 703 accumulated other comprehensive income $ 700 $

decreased post-retirement project benefit obligations by $8 in 2006. yield curves matching our benefit obligations were derived using a cash flow analysis under the citigroup pension discount curve. the citigroup pension discount curve shows the relationship between interest rates and duration for hypothetical zero coupon investments. under this approach, treasury par curve data is used to set the shape of the yield curve and calculate the aa corporate spot yield at each maturity. the resulting curve was used to identify a discount rate for the company of 5.9% and 5.75% in 2006 and 2005, respectively, based on the timing of future benefit payments. the decision to use 8% as the expected long-term return on plan assets was made based on an analysis of the actual plan asset returns over multiple time horizons and review of assumptions used by other u.s. corporations with defined benefit plans of similar size and investment strategy. the average actual return on plan assets during the 18 years ended december 31, 2006 approximated 10%. pension and other benefit plan costs can be impacted by actual results that differ from assumptions selected. these differences are reflected in financial results over future periods. actual returns on pension assets were $28, $18 and $19 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, compared to expected returns of $32, $21 and $14 for the same periods. if the difference between expected returns and actual results related to plan assets, combined with the gains or losses resulting from the projected benefit obligation, fall outside certain limits, the difference will be amortized into future earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining working life of the participants (currently 13.1 years). the following table provides

our gold production at market prices. we have, however, entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold and copper production and to manage risks associated with commodities, interest rates and foreign currencies. by using derivatives, we are affected by credit risk, market risk and market liquidity risk. credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. we mitigate credit risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of the counterparties. market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. we manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. we mitigate this risk by establishing trading agreements with counterparties under which we are not 75 table of contents required to post any collateral or make any margin calls on our derivatives. our counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative. market liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing an offsetting position. under the terms of our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant breeches, including financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. we generally mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of our derivatives over time. during 2007, 2006, and 2005, we entered into idr/$ forward purchase contracts to hedge a portion of our idr/$ operating expenditure exposure. in 2007, we entered into two programs in australia/new zealand to hedge a portion of our a$ operating expenditure exposure and our a$ capital expenditure exposure related to the construction of the boddington project. all of the currency contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of future expenditures, and as such, changes in the market value have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income . during 2005 and 2006, we entered into copper option collar contracts to hedge the copper price realized during those periods. final delivery under the copper collar contracts occurred in february 2007. as of december 31, 2006, approximately 13 million pounds of copper were hedged by the copper collar contracts, which had been designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted copper sales, and as such, changes in the fair value related to the effective portion of the hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income . as of december 31, 2006, approximately 89 million pounds of copper option collar contracts were accounted for on a mark-to-market basis currently through earnings. for 2007, 2006 and 2005, net gains (losses) of $4, ($60) and $2, respectively, were included in other income, net for the ineffective portion of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. the amount to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , net of tax to income for derivative instruments during the next 12 months is a gain of approximately $8. the maximum period over which hedged forecasted transactions are expected to occur is 4 years. foreign currency contracts we had the following foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2007: expected maturity date fair

fixed to floating swap contracts designated as a hedge against a portion of its $275 8 5 / 8 % debentures expiring in 2011. in 2001, newmont entered into contracts to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk exposure on a portion of its $275 8 5 / 8 % debentures expiring in 2011 and its $200 8 3 / 8 % debentures which expired in 2005. under the $275 8 5 / 8 % debentures hedge contract terms, we receive fixed-rate interest payments at 8.625% and pay floating-rate interest amounts based on periodic london interbank offered rate ( libor ) settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 3.49%. prior to expiration of the $200 8 3 / 8 % debentures and associated hedge contracts, newmont received fixed-rate interest payments of 8.375% and paid floating-rate interest amounts based on periodic libor settings, plus a spread, ranging from 3.41% to 4.25%. these transactions resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $nil, $nil and $3 for the years ended december 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. the fair value of the interest rate swaps was $4 and $1 at december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. provisional copper and gold sales our sales based on a provisional sales price contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. the host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward london metal exchange price at the time of sale. the embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement. as of december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, we had embedded copper derivatives on 113 million pounds and 186 million pounds, recorded at an average price of $3.02 and $2.87 per pound, respectively. as of december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, we had embedded gold derivatives on 8,000 ounces and 69,000 ounces, recorded at an average price of $827.70 and $637.96 per ounce, respectively. for 2007, 2006 and 2005, batu hijau recorded the following gross revenues before treatment and refining charges, which were subject to final price adjustments as of december 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, as follows:

accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities-an amendment to sfas no. 133. the company reported a $531 pre-tax loss on the early settlement of the contracts, after a $47 reversal of previously recognized deferred revenue in 2007. see note 3 for additional details. 77 table of contents copper collar contracts during 2005 and 2006, newmont entered into copper option collar contracts to hedge the copper price realized during those periods. final delivery under the copper collar contracts occurred in february 2007. as of december 31, 2006, approximately 13 million pounds of copper were hedged by the copper option collar contracts, which had been designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted copper sales. as such, changes in the fair value related to the effective portion of the hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income . as of december 31, 2006, approximately 89 million pounds of copper option collar contracts were accounted for on a mark-to-market basis through earnings, and the fair value of the copper collar contracts at december 31, 2006 was $(173). fixed and variable rate debt we have both fixed and variable rate debt. 86% and 74% of debt was fixed and 14% and 26% was variable as of december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. we have managed some of our fixed rate debt exposure by entering into interest rate swaps (see interest rate swap contracts above). our fixed rate debt exposure as of december 31, 2007 and 2006 is summarized as follows: 2007 2006 carrying value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 1,965 $ 934 fair value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 2,206 $ 919 pro forma fair value sensitivity of fixed rate debt of a / 10 basis point interest rate change (2) $ / 10.8 $ / 8.2 (1) excludes specialized and hybrid debt instruments for which it is not practicable to estimate fair values and pro forma fair values or sensitivities. these instruments include the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant, ptnnt project financing facility, ptnnt partner loan, yanacocha project financing and certain capital leases. the estimated fair value quoted above may or may not reflect the actual trading value of these instruments. (2) the pro forma information assumes a / 10 basis point change in market interest rates as of december 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions. 78 table of contentsquantitative and

market risk (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) metal price changes in the market price of gold and copper significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the relative strength of the u.s. dollar and global mine production levels. copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. 86 table of contents newmont mining corporation foreign currency changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar may affect our profitability and cash flow. foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and u.s. currencies and u.s. and foreign country economic conditions. in addition to our operations in the united states, we have assets or operations in australia, peru, indonesia, ghana, mexico, new zealand and canada. all of our operations sell their metal production based on u.s. dollar gold and copper prices. fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and costs applicable to sales per ounce to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate has had the greatest impact on our costs applicable to sales , as measured in u.s. dollars. however, variations in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate have historically been strongly correlated to variations in the u.s. dollar gold price over the long-term. increases or decreases in costs at australian gold operations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in u.s. dollars for such locations. no assurance can be given that the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the u.s. dollar gold price in the future, or that short-term changes in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on our profitability and cash flow. foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. however, if a sustained weakening of the u.s. dollar in relation to the australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the u.s. dollar gold price or by other factors, profitability, cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced. the extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the u.s. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. for information concerning the sensitivity of our costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see item 7, management discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations and financial condition-results of consolidated operations-foreign currency exchange rates, above. hedging our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in gold and copper prices by selling our production at spot market prices. consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper sales. we have and will continue to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and foreign currencies using the derivative market. by using derivatives, we are affected by credit risk, market risk and market liquidity risk. credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. we

maturity of our derivatives over time. 87 table of contents newmont mining corporation cash flow hedges we utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the variability of the us dollar amount of forecasted foreign currency expenditures caused by changes in exchange rates. we hedge a portion of our a$ and nz$ denominated operating expenditures which results in a blended rate realized each period. the hedging instruments are fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to five years from the date of issue. the principal hedging objective is reduction in the volatility of realized period-on-period $/a$ and $/nz$ rates, respectively. we also utilize foreign currency contracts to hedge a portion of the company a$ denominated capital expenditures related to the construction of the akyem project in africa and the tanami mine shaft in australia. the hedging instruments are fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to three years. we use diesel contracts to reduce the variability of our operating cost exposure related to diesel prices of fuel consumed at our nevada operations. we utilize forward starting swap contracts to hedge against adverse movements in interest rates related to an expected debt issuance. all of the currency, diesel and forward starting swap contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of future expenditures, and as such, changes in the market value have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income . gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings .

2011, we entered into forward starting swap contracts with a total notional value of $2,000. these contracts hedge movements in treasury rates related to an expected debt issuance. subsequent to entering into the forward starting swap contracts, we revised our expected debt issuance date to the first half of 2012 and extended the terms of the forward starting swap contracts resulting in the recognition of a $15 charge related to hedge ineffectiveness. at december 31, 2011, the hedge contracts were in a liability position of $399. the proceeds from the expected debt issuance will be adjusted by the fair value of the swap contracts at the time of issuance. if the anticipated debt issuance does not proceed, we will be required to cash settle the swap contracts with the full amount of the payment charged against earnings. treasury rate lock contracts in connection with the 2019 and 2039 notes issued in september 2009, we acquired treasury rate lock contracts to reduce the variability of the proceeds realized from the bond issuances. the treasury rate locks resulted in $6 and $5 unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive income for the 2019 and 2039 notes, respectively. we previously acquired treasury rate locks in connection with the issuance of the 2035 notes that resulted in a $10 unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income . the gains/losses from these contracts are recognized in interest expense, net over the terms of the respective notes. fair value hedges interest rate risk we had $222 fixed to floating swap contracts designated as a hedge against debt which matured in may 2011. the fair value of the interest rate swaps was $3 at december 31, 2010. provisional copper and gold sales our provisional copper and gold sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. the host contract is the receivable from the sale of the gold and copper concentrates at the prevailing indices prices at the time of sale. the embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement. the average lme copper price was $4.00 per pound during 2011, compared with the company recorded average provisional price of $4.02 before mark-to-market losses and treatment and refining charges. during 2011, decreasing copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of $92 ($0.26 per pound). at december 31, 2011, newmont had copper sales of 79 million pounds priced at an average of $3.43 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. each $0.10 change in the price for provisionally priced sales would have an approximate $3 effect on our net income attributable to newmont stockholders . the average london p.m. fix for gold was $1,572 per ounce during 2011, compared with the company recorded average provisional price of $1,567 per ounce before mark-to-market gains and treatment and refining charges. during 2011, increasing gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of $31 ($5 per ounce). at december 31, 2011, newmont had gold sales of 85,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,576 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months. each $25 change in the price for provisionally priced gold sales would have an approximate $1 effect on our net income attributable to newmont stockholders . 89 table of contents newmont mining corporation fixed and variable rate debt we have both fixed and variable rate debt. 98% and 99% of our debt portfolio was fixed rate debt at december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the carrying value of fixed rate debt slightly decreased primarily due to the repayment of the 2011 8 5/8% debentures, partially offset by note discount amortization. our fixed rate debt exposure at december 31, 2011 and 2010 is summarized as follows: at december 31, 2011 2010

subject to final pricing over the next several months. each $0.10 change in the price for provisionally priced sales would have an approximate $2 effect on our net income attributable to newmont stockholders . the average london p.m. fix for gold was $1,669 per ounce during 2012, compared with the company recorded average provisional price of $1,668 per ounce before mark-to-market adjustments and treatment and refining charges. during 2012, increasing gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of $4 ($1 per ounce). at december 31, 2012, newmont had gold sales of 77,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,665 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months. each $25 change in the price for provisionally priced gold sales would have an approximate $1 effect on our net income attributable to newmont stockholders . fixed and variable rate debt our debt portafolio consisted of 96% and 98% of fixed rate debt at december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the carrying value of fixed rate debt increase primarily due to a two part public offering of $1,500 and $1,000 uncollateralized senior notes in march 2012, partially offset by the maturity of the company 2012 convertible senior notes. our fixed rate debt exposure at december 31, 2012 and 2011 is summarized as follows: at december 31, 2012 2011 carrying value of fixed rate debt $ 6,069 $ 4,059 fair value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 6,820 $ 5,010 pro forma fair value sensitivity of fixed rate debt of a +/ 10 basis point interest rate change (2) $ +/-27 $ +/-36 (1) excludes specialized and hybrid debt instruments for which it is not practicable to estimate fair values and pro forma fair values or sensitivities. these instruments include the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant and certain capital leases. the estimated fair value quoted above may or may not reflect the actual trading value of these instruments. (2) the pro forma information assumes a +/ 10 basis point change in market interest rates at december 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions. 90 table of contents newmont mining

disclosures about market risk (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) metal price changes in the market price of gold significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the strength of the u.s. dollar; inflation, deflation, or other general price instability; and global mine production levels. changes in the market price of copper also affect our profitability and cash flow. copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. foreign currency changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar may affect our profitability and cash flow. foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and u.s. currencies and u.s. and foreign country economic conditions. in addition to our operations in the united states, we have assets or operations in australia, peru, indonesia, ghana, mexico and new zealand. all of our operations sell their metal production based on u.s. dollar gold and copper prices. fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and costs applicable to sales per ounce to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate has had the greatest impact on our costs applicable to sales , as measured in u.s. dollars. however, variations in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate have historically been strongly correlated to variations in the u.s. dollar gold price over the long-term. increases or decreases in costs at australian gold operations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in u.s. dollars for such locations. no assurance can be given that the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the u.s. dollar gold price in the future, or that short-term changes in the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on our profitability and cash flow. foreign currency 94 table of contents newmont mining corporation exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. however, if a sustained weakening of the u.s. dollar in relation to the australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the u.s. dollar gold price or by other factors, profitability, cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced. the extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the u.s. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. for information concerning the sensitivity of our costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see item 7, management discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations and financial condition-results of consolidated operations-foreign currency exchange rates, above. hedging our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in gold and copper prices by selling our production at spot market prices. consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper sales. we have and will continue to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and foreign currencies using the derivative market. by using derivatives, we are affected by credit risk, market risk and market liquidity risk. credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. we mitigate credit risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of the counterparties. market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. we manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. we mitigate this potential risk to our financial condition by establishing trading agreements with counterparties under which we are not required to post any collateral or make any margin calls on our derivatives. our counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative. market liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing an offsetting position. under the terms of our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant breeches, including financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. we further mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of our derivatives over time. cash flow hedges we utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the variability of the us dollar amount of forecasted foreign currency expenditures caused by changes in exchange rates. we hedge a portion of our a$ and nz$ denominated operating expenditures which results in a blended rate realized each period. the hedging instruments are fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to five years from the date of issue. the principal hedging objective is reduction in the volatility of realized period-on-period $/a$ and $/nz$ rates, respectively. we also utilize foreign currency contracts to hedge a portion of the company a$ denominated capital expenditures related to the construction of the akyem project in africa. the hedging instruments are fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to three years. we use diesel contracts to reduce the variability of our operating cost exposure related to diesel prices of fuel consumed at our nevada operations. all of the currency, diesel and forward starting swap contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of future expenditures, and as such, changes in the market value have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income . gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings . 95 table of contents newmont mining corporation foreign currency exchange risk

of $1,000 (30-year notes). as a result, the forward-starting interest rate swaps were settled for $362, of which $349 represented the effective portion of the hedging instrument included in accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in interest expense consistent with the interest incurred on the senior notes issued in 2012. the net proceeds from the debt issuance were adjusted by the settlement amount of the swap contracts and included as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flow fair value hedges interest rate risk we had $222 fixed to floating swap contracts designated as a hedge against debt which matured in may 2011. provisional copper and gold sales our provisional copper and gold sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. the host contract is the receivable from the 96 table of contents newmont mining corporation sale of the gold and copper concentrates at the prevailing indices prices at the time of sale. the embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement. the average lme copper price was $3.32 per pound during 2013, compared with the company recorded average provisional price of $3.30 before mark-to-market adjustments and treatment and refining charges. during 2013, changes in copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of $11 ($0.05 per pound). at december 31, 2013, newmont had copper sales of 61 million pounds priced at an average of $3.34 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. each $0.10 change in the price for provisionally priced sales would have an approximate $2 effect

traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. decreases in the market price of gold and copper can also significantly affect the value of our product inventory, stockpiles and leach pads, and it may be necessary to record a write-down to the nrv. nrv represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. the primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles, leach pads, and product inventory include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. the significant assumptions in determining the stockpile, leach pad and product inventory adjustments for each mine site reporting unit at december 31, 2015 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a short-term and long-term gold price of $1,106 and $1,300 per ounce, respectively, a short-term and long-term copper price of $2.22 and $3.00 per pound, respectively, and an australian to u.s. dollar long-term exchange rate of $0.80. the nrv measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. a high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. foreign currency changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar may affect our profitability and cash

2019 term loan in 2016 . our fixed rate debt exposure at december 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows: at december 31, 2016 2015 carrying value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 4,604 $ 5,576 fair value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 4,882 $ 5,029 pro forma fair value sensitivity of fixed rate debt of a +/- 10 basis point interest rate change (2) $ 36 $ 39 (1) excludes capital leases for which it is not practicable to estimate fair values and pro forma fair values or sensitivities. (2) the pro forma information assumes a +/ 10 basis point change in market interest rates at december 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions . 96 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 91 metal prices 91 foreign currency 91 hedging 92 commodity price exposure 93 fixed and variable rate debt 93 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market ris k (dollars in millions, except per ounce and per pound amounts). metal prices changes in the market price of gold significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the strength of the u.s. dollar; inflation, deflation, or other general price instability and global mine production levels. changes in the market price of copper also affect our profitability and cash flow. copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. decreases in the market price of gold and copper can also significantly affect the value of our product inventory, stockpiles and leach pads, and it may be necessary to record a write-down to the net realizable value. net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. the primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles, leach pads, and product inventory include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. the significant assumptions in determining the stockpile, leach pad and product inventory adjustments for each mine site reporting unit at december 31, 2017 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a short-term and long-term gold price of $1,275 and $1,300 per ounce, respectively, a short-term and long-term copper price of $3.09 and $3.00 per pound, respectively, and a short-term and long-term australian to u.s. dollar exchange rate of $0.77 and $0.80, respectively. the net realizable value measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. a high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. foreign currency changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar may affect our profitability and cash flow. foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and u.s. currencies and u.s. and foreign country economic conditions. in addition to our operations in the united states, we have assets or operations in australia, peru, ghana and suriname. all of our operations sell their metal production based on u.s. dollar gold and copper prices. 91 table of contents fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate has had the greatest impact on our costs applicable to sales , as measured in u.s. dollars. foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in the past; however, if a sustained weakening of the u.s. dollar in relation to the australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the u.s. dollar gold price or by other factors, profitability, cash flows and/or the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. the extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the u.s. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. future reductions of proven and probable reserves could result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased depreciation and amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development ; mineral interests and/or goodwill. for information concerning the sensitivity of our costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see results of consolidated operations and foreign currency exchange rates sections in item 7, management discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations. hedging our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in gold and copper prices by selling our production at spot market prices. consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper sales. we have and may continue to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and foreign currencies using the derivative market. by using hedges, we are affected by credit risk, market risk and market liquidity risk. credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. we mitigate credit risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of the counterparties. market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying commodity prices, interest rates or currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. we manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. we mitigate this potential risk to our financial condition by establishing trading agreements with counterparties under which we are not required to post any collateral or be subject to any margin calls on our derivatives. our counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative. market liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing an offsetting position. under the terms of our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant breaches, including financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. we further mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of our derivatives over time. cash flow hedges the foreign currency and diesel derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, and as such, the effective portion of unrealized changes in market value have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to income during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings . foreign currency exchange risk we had the following foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at december 31, 2017: expected maturity date 2018 total/average a$ operating fixed forward contracts: a$ notional (millions) 6 6 average rate ($/a$) 0.92 0.92 the fair value of the a$ foreign currency derivative contracts was a net liability position of $1 at december 31, 2017 and

diesel consumed at its nevada operations to reduce the variability in realized diesel prices. the hedging instruments consist of a series of financially settled fixed forward contracts with expiration dates up to two years. the fair value of the diesel derivative contracts was a net asset position of $6 at december 31, 2017 and $- at december 31, 2016. commodity price exposure our provisional gold and copper sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. the host contract is the receivable from the sale of the gold and copper concentrates at the prevailing indices prices at the time of sale. the embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement. at december 31, 2017, newmont had gold sales of 76,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,299 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months. each $25 change in the price for provisionally priced gold sales would have an approximate $1 effect on our net income (loss) attributable to newmont stockholders . the london bullion market association settlement price at the end of 2017 for gold was $1,291 per ounce. at december 31, 2017, newmont had copper sales of 21 million pounds priced at an average of $3.26 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. each $0.10 change in the price for provisionally priced copper sales would have an approximate $1 effect on our net income (loss) attributable to newmont stockholders . the lme closing settlement price at the end of 2017 for copper was $3.25 per pound. fixed and variable rate debt our debt portfolio consisted of 100% fixed rate debt at december 31, 2017 and 2016. the decrease in the carrying value of fixed rate debt was primarily due to the repayment of the 2017 convertible senior notes in 2017 . our fixed rate debt exposure at december 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows: at december 31, 2017 2016 carrying value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 4,047 $ 4,605 fair value of fixed rate debt (1) $ 4,671 $ 4,882 pro forma fair value sensitivity of fixed rate debt of a +/- 10 basis point interest rate change (2) $ 60 $ 36 (1) excludes capital leases for which it is not practicable to estimate fair values and pro forma fair values or sensitivities. (2) the pro forma information assumes a +/ 10 basis point change in market interest rates at december 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions . 93 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 97 metal prices 97 foreign currency 97 hedging 97 commodity price exposure 98 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market ris k (dollars in millions, except per ounce and per pound amounts). metal prices changes in the market price of gold significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand;
