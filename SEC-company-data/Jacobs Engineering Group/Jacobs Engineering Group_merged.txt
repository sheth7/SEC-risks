risk factors page18 risk factors we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. if any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities. construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. on many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental ( hse ) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. as a result, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. negative conditions in the credit and financial markets could impair our ability to operate our business, implement our acquisition strategy, or access our cash and short-term investments; it could also adversely affect our customers' businesses. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. in addition, some of our clients depend on the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects. due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the u.s. and abroad, the availability of credit has continued to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain in spite of government efforts to stabilize the credit markets. this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us. in addition, these market conditions could negatively impact our clients' ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a diminution in our clients' access to the credit markets. if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and page18 table of contents financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, south america, australia and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that this may occur in the future. if this were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations. our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns. we provide technical, professional, construction, and o&amp;m services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; mining and minerals; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; power; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; and food and consumer products). these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. current global economic conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients' ability and willingness to fund their projects. they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms, and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, in the public sector, declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. in addition, due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. these conditions have reduced the demand for our services, which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations. current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients' markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients' markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers' investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. to the extent commidity prices decline and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. page19 table of contents in addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur cost resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business. since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation if there is a failure at any such project. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients' projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. in addition, while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. our insurers are also subject to business risk and, as a result, one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise. in addition, the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies, which are a significant source of our revenue and profit, are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as cost controls. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues page20 table of contents (for example, those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 22.1% of our total revenue in fiscal 2012 ), a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. if the u.s. federal government is unable to agree on a budget by the end of 2012 and the terms of the budget control act of 2011 go into effect, it may have a material adverse impact on our business with the u.s. federal government and could potentially cause a more general recession in the u.s. most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. the u.s. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contacts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract. this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. moreover, we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. in addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affects how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and numerous regulations governing security, environmental protection, and employment practices. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies such as the u.s. defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. for example, in so-called "qui tam" actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts. to the extent this occurs, our operations and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price contracts. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. for fiscal 2012 , approximately 15.0% of our revenues were earned under contracts that were fixed-price in nature. for these contracts, we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. fixed-price contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of raw materials, or our vendors' or subcontractors' inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. page21 table of contents the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins. as of the end of fiscal 2012 , our backlog totaled approximately $15.9 billion . there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client. in addition, the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide-spread economic slowdowns. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in the industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages, provide additional services, or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. under agreements with joint and several liabilities, we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability. in the current economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party's ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. page22 table of contents maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers. these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety's sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the company's credit worthiness. because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws is joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers, and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. such laws, regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. our failure to comply with such laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state, and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and result of operations. our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders. although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and therefore, our ability to do business. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our page23 table of contents employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), the u.k. bribery act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2012 , 2011 , and fiscal 2010 , approximately 22.1% , 24.4% , and 25.4% , respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay, or cancel their contracts at any time. our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients. the extent of such competition varies by industry, geographic market, and project type. for example, with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our larger competitors for engineering, construction, and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel, fluor, foster wheeler, kbr, technip, worleyparsons, the shaw group, and amec. in the area of buildings, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr, hok, aecom, and turner. in the area of infrastructure, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs, parsons brinckerhoff, hntb, tetra tech, parsons, and w.s. atkins. in the area of national government programs, our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as saic, ch2m hill, weston, lockheed martin, and computer sciences corporation. in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors, our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2012 , approximately 38.0% of our revenues was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. at a minimum, our reported financial condition and results of operations page24 table of contents are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. in addition, our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; embargoes; acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; expropriation of property; tax increases; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and u.s. government policies. the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. in addition, military action or continued unrest, particularly in the middle east, could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects. while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. these actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. based on fluctuations in currency, the u.s. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies presents a number of risks, including: assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting management's attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition; page25 table of contents difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities; and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business. while we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds, and the indemnitors may not have ability to financially support the indemnity. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. the credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. accordingly, we filed a shelf registration statement on form s-4 on december 7, 2007. if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders' individual ownership percentages in the company. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock, because of a number of factors, including: fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; changes in prices of commodities or other supplies; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; natural disasters or other crises, such as the hurricanes affecting oil-producing regions like the gulf of mexico; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under u.s. gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; page26 table of contents the amount of reserves necessary for self-insured risks; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions; valuation of stock-based compensation; and the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs. our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. under u.s. gaap, we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach. as of september 28, 2012 , we had $2.0 billion of goodwill, representing 29.4% of our total assets of $6.8 billion . we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below. we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage. we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. for example, as of september 28, 2012 and september 30, 2011, our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans were projected to be underfunded by $463.7 million and $421.0 million , respectively. see note 7 pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional disclosure. in the future, our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan asset performance and other factors. if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 85.0% during fiscal 2012 ), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. for example, there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients. legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels. such changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. however, these changes could also page27 table of contents increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, that could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate. we rely heavily on computer, information, and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. from time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption, or release of data. in addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, or similar events or disruptions. any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property, and results of operations, as well as those of our clients. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients. our technology and intellectual property provide us, in many instances, with a competitive advantage. although we protect our property through patent registrations, license restrictions, and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the u.s. if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. in addition, our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages. we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services. for example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares. page28 table of contents these types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk page45 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk please refer to the discussion of the company's 2012 facility in the liquidity and capital resources discussion in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form 10-k. foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of asc 815-10 in accounting for our derivative contracts. the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.risk factors page 18 risk factors we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. if any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities. construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. on many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental ( hse ) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. as a result, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty engineering services. our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards could result in large damages. our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability, warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, or could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. in addition, clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. an uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a substantial impact on our operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business. since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation if there is a failure at any such project. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients' projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. in addition, while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us. page 18 table of contents we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. our insurers are also subject to business risk and, as a result, one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise. in addition, the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price contracts. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. for fiscal 2013 , approximately 15.0% of our revenues were earned under contracts that were fixed-price in nature. for these contracts, we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. fixed-price contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of raw materials, or our vendors' or subcontractors' inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns or time of political uncertainty. we provide technical, professional, construction, and o&amp;m services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; mining and minerals; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; power; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; and food and consumer products). these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty. current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients' ability and willingness to fund their projects. they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms, and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, in the public sector, declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. in addition, due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. these conditions have reduced the demand for our services, which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations. current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients' markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not page 19 table of contents recover as quickly as the economy at large. a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients' markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers' investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. to the extent commodity prices decline and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. in addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies, which are a significant source of our revenue and profit, are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as cost controls. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (for example, those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 19.9% of our total revenue in fiscal 2013 ), a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. page 20 table of contents most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. the u.s. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contacts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract. this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. moreover, we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. in addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affects how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and numerous regulations governing, environmental protection, and employment practices. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies such as the u.s. defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. for example, in so-called "qui tam" actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts. to the extent this occurs, our operations and results of operations could be negatively impacted. the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins. as of the end of fiscal 2013 , our backlog totaled approximately $17.2 billion . there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client. in addition, the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide-spread economic slowdowns. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. page 21 table of contents negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. in addition, some of our clients depend on the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects. instability in the credit markets in the u.s. or abroad, could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain. this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us. we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit, which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business. in addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients' ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a diminution in our clients' access to the credit markets. if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, south america, australia and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that this may occur in the future. if this were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations. our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in the industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages, provide additional services, or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. under agreements with joint and several liabilities, we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. page 22 table of contents we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability. in the current economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party's ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers. these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety's sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the company's credit worthiness. because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. past and future environmental, heath, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities. we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws is joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers, and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. such laws, regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. our failure to comply with such laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. page 23 table of contents in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state, and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and result of operations. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders. although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and therefore, our ability to do business. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), the u.k. bribery act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2013 , 2012 , and fiscal 2011 , approximately 19.9% , 22.1% , and 24.4% , respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay, or cancel their contracts at any time. our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients. the extent of such competition varies by industry, geographic market, and project type. for example, with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, page 24 table of contents and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our larger competitors for engineering, construction, and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel, fluor, foster wheeler, kbr, technip, worleyparsons, cb&amp;i, and amec. in the area of buildings, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr, hok, aecom, and turner. in the area of infrastructure, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs, parsons brinckerhoff, hntb, tetra tech, parsons, and w.s. atkins. in the area of national government programs, our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as leidos, ch2m hill, weston, lockheed martin, and computer sciences corporation. in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors, our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2013 , approximately 40.8% of our revenues was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; embargoes; acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; expropriation of property; tax increases; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and u.s. government policies. the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. in addition, military action or continued unrest, particularly in the middle east, could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. we work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost. some of our services are performed in high risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. in those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors. foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects. our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative page 25 table of contents (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. these actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. based on fluctuations in currency, the u.s. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies presents a number of risks, including: assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting management's attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition; difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities; and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business. while we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds, and the indemnitors may not have ability to financially support the indemnity. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions credit market conditions may also make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. accordingly, we filed a shelf registration statement on form s-4 on december 7, 2007. if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders' individual ownership percentages in the company. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock, because of a number of factors, including: fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; page 26 table of contents changes in prices of commodities or other supplies; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; natural disasters or other crises; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under u.s. gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; the amount of reserves necessary for self-insured risks; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions; valuation of stock-based compensation; and the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs. our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. under u.s. gaap, we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach. as of september 27, 2013 , we had $2.0 billion of goodwill, representing 27.8% of our total assets of $7.3 billion . we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below. we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage. we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. for example, as of september 27, 2013 , and september 28, 2012 , our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans were projected to be underfunded by $402.5 million and $463.7 million , respectively. see note 6 pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional disclosure. in the future, our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of page 27 table of contents interest rates, pension plan asset performance and other factors. if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 85.0% during fiscal 2013 ), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. for example, there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients. legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels. such changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. however, these changes could also increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, that could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate. we rely heavily on computer, information, and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. from time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption, or release of data. in addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, or similar events or disruptions. any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property, and results of operations, as well as those of our clients. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients. our technology and intellectual property provide us, in many instances, with a competitive advantage. although we protect our property through patent registrations, license restrictions, and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the u.s. if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. in addition, our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. there is a risk we page 28 table of contents may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control. extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate. as an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity. we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. if we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a negative impact on our operations. in addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits. we are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages. we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services. for example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares. these types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk page 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk please refer to the discussion of the company's 2012 facility in the liquidity and capital resources discussion in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form 10-k. foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of asc 815-10 in accounting for our derivative contracts. the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.risk factors page 19 risk factors we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. if any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities. construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. on many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental ( hse ) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. as a result, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty engineering services. our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards could result in large damages. our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability, warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, or could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. in addition, clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. an uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a substantial impact on our operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business. since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation if there is a failure at any such project. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients' projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. in addition, while page 19 table of contents clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. for example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. we also monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. if any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted. in addition, the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price contracts. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. for fiscal 2014 , approximately 17.0% of our revenues were earned under contracts that were fixed-price in nature. for these contracts, we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. fixed-price contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of raw materials, or our vendors' or subcontractors' inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns or time of political uncertainty. we provide technical, professional, construction, and o&amp;m services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; mining and minerals; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; power; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; and food and consumer products). these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty. page 20 table of contents current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients' ability and willingness to fund their projects. they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms, and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, in the public sector, declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. in addition, due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. these conditions have reduced the demand for our services, which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations. current economic and political conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients' markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients' markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers' investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. to the extent commodity prices decline and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. in addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. page 21 table of contents contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies, which are a significant source of our revenue and profit, are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as cost controls. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (for example, those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 17.8% of our total revenue in fiscal 2014 ), a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. the u.s. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contacts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract. this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. moreover, we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. in addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affects how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and numerous regulations governing, environmental protection, and employment practices. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies such as the u.s. defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. for example, in so-called "qui tam" actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts. to the extent this occurs, our operations and results of operations could be negatively impacted. the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins. as of the end of fiscal 2014 , our backlog totaled approximately $18.4 billion . there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client. page 22 table of contents in addition, the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide-spread economic slowdowns. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. in addition, some of our clients depend on the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects. instability in the credit markets in the u.s. or abroad, could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain. this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us. we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit, which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business. in addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients' ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a diminution in our clients' access to the credit markets. if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, south america, australia and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that this may occur in the future. if this were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations. our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in the industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages, provide additional services, or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. under agreements with joint and several liabilities, we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners. these page 23 table of contents circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability. in the current economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party's ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers. these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety's sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the company's credit worthiness. because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. past and future environmental, heath, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities. we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws is joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current page 24 table of contents and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers, and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. such laws, regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. our failure to comply with such laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state, and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and result of operations. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders. although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and therefore, our ability to do business. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), the u.k. bribery act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. page 25 table of contents the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2014 , 2013 , and fiscal 2012 , approximately 17.8% , 19.9% , and 22.1% , respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay, or cancel their contracts at any time. our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients. the extent of such competition varies by industry, geographic market, and project type. for example, with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our larger competitors for engineering, construction, and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel, fluor, foster wheeler, kbr, technip, worleyparsons, cb&amp;i, and amec. in the area of buildings, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr, hok, aecom, and turner. in the area of infrastructure, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff, hntb, tetra tech, parsons, and w.s. atkins. in the area of national government programs, our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as leidos, ch2m hill, weston, lockheed martin, and computer sciences corporation. in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors, our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2014 , approximately 44.2% of our revenues was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; embargoes; acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; expropriation of property; tax increases; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and u.s. government policies. the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. in addition, military action or continued unrest, particularly in the middle east, could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or page 26 table of contents adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. we work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost. some of our services are performed in high risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. in those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors. foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects. our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. these actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. based on fluctuations in currency, the u.s. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies presents a number of risks, including: assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting management's attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition; difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities; and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business. while we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds, and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions credit market conditions may also make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. page 27 table of contents in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. accordingly, we filed a shelf registration statement on form s-4 on december 7, 2007. if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders' individual ownership percentages in the company. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock, because of a number of factors, including: fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; changes in prices of commodities or other supplies; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; natural disasters or other crises; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under u.s. gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; the amount of reserves necessary for self-insured risks; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions; valuation of stock-based compensation; and the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs. our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. under u.s. gaap, we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach. as of september 26, 2014 , we had $3.0 billion of goodwill, representing 35.8% of our total assets of $8.5 billion . we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at page 28 table of contents the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below. we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage. we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. for example, as of september 26, 2014 , and september 27, 2013 , our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans were projected to be underfunded by $400.8 million and $402.5 million , respectively. see note 6 pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional disclosure. in the future, our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan asset performance and other factors. if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 83.0% during fiscal 2014 ), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. for example, there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients. legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels. such changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. however, these changes could also increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, that could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. page 29 table of contents systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate. we rely heavily on computer, information, and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. from time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption, or release of data. in addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, or similar events or disruptions. any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property, and results of operations, as well as those of our clients. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients. our technology and intellectual property provide us, in many instances, with a competitive advantage. although we protect our property through patent registrations, license restrictions, and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the u.s. if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. in addition, our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control. extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate. as an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity. we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. if we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a negative impact on our operations. in addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits. we are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages. we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services. for example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: our board of directors is divided into three staggered classes (although our board of directors is currently being destaggered); only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and page 30 table of contents our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares. these types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk page 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk please refer to the discussion of the 2014 facility and the 2012 facility in the liquidity and capital resources discussion in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form 10-k, and note 5 - borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k. foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of asc 815-10 - derivatives and hedging in accounting for our derivative contracts. the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.risk factors page 20 risk factors we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. if any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials, in a challenging environment. on many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured, disabled or even lose their lives, the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed, and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and/or criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental ( hse ) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. in addition, despite the work of our functional groups, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work, equipment or supplies. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. accordingly, if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards, we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns or time of political uncertainty. we provide technical, professional, construction, and o&amp;m services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; mining and minerals; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; power; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; and food and consumer products). these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty. current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients' ability and willingness to fund their projects, including their ability to raise capital and pay, or timely pay, our invoices. they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms, and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, in the public sector, declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. in addition, due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. these conditions have reduced , and may continue to reduce, the demand for our services, which has had, and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. current economic and political conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients' markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may page 20 table of contents not recover as quickly as the economy at large. a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients' markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers' investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty engineering services. if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards, we could be exposed to large damages or even criminal violations. our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability, and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage, and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. further, even where coverage applies, the policies have deductibles, which result in our assumption of exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any claim filed by us. in addition, clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. an uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a substantial impact on our operations. we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients. the extent of such competition varies by industry, geographic market, and project type. for example, with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. the extent and type of competition varies by market and geographic area. competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us, thereby increasing the risk that we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we've seen in the past. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. page 21 table of contents our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts. our revenues are derived from new contract awards. delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such prospects as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our long-term projected results. it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive large-scale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, governmental and environmental approvals. since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. in addition, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and as a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project. the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. in some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business. since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients' projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. in addition, while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying exclusions, coverage limits and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. for example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. if any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted. in addition, the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors for, among other things, additional costs exceeding the original contract price. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. further, these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations, arbitration or litigation proceedings, which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims. a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. page 22 table of contents litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the nature of our contracts, particularly those that are fixed-price, subject us to risks of cost overruns. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. for fiscal 2015 , approximately 17.0% of our revenues were earned under fixed-price contracts. such contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance. for these contracts, we may benefit from any cost-savings, but we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. fixed-price contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather or other delays beyond our control, changes in the costs of raw materials, or our vendors' or subcontractors' inability or failure to perform, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. these risks are exacerbated for projects with long-term durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted. like fixed-price contracts, the expected cost of cost-reimbursable projects are based in part on our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts. if we are unable to properly support the costs we incur or otherwise fail to obtain proper reimbursement for all costs incurred - for whatever reason - the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses. additionally, we may be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel . the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals at a reasonable cost who have the required experience and expertise. the market for these and other personnel is competitive. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients, or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. in addition, some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects. if we were to lose some or all of these personnel, they would be difficult to replace. in addition, in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans, which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. page 23 table of contents the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins. as of the end of fiscal 2015 , our backlog totaled approximately $18.8 billion . there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client. in the event of a project cancellation, we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide-spread economic slowdowns. the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies, which are a significant source of our revenue and profit, are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (for example, those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 21.7% of our total revenue in fiscal 2015 ), a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. the u.s. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract. this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. moreover, we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. in addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affects how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and numerous regulations governing, environmental protection, and employment practices. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies such as the u.s. defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with page 24 table of contents our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. for example, in so-called "qui tam" actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts. to the extent this occurs, our operations and results of operations could be negatively impacted. our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in the industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including the nonperformance, default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners. our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages, provide additional services, or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. under agreements with joint and several liabilities, we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners. differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues, which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures. we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability. there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed, customer concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract. in addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. page 25 table of contents in the current economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party's ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems, adversely affecting our cost of borrowing or our business. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. in addition, some of our clients depend on the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects. instability in the credit markets in the u.s. or abroad, could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us. we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit, which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business. in addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients' ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, our clients' unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital. if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, south america, australia and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that such events may occur in the future. if any such events were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers. these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety's sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the company's credit worthiness. because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. in addition, future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities. our inability to obtain page 26 table of contents adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. past and future environmental, heath, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities. we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws is joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers, and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. such laws, regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. changes in the environmental laws and regulations, remediation obligations, enforcement actions, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. if we fail to comply with such laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, we could be exposed to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state, and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and result of operations. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders. although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges privileges or debarment from participation in u.s. government contracts, and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, regulations pertaining to export control, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a page 27 table of contents security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, cancellation of contracts, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), the u.k. bribery act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2015 , 2014 , and fiscal 2013 , approximately 21.7% , 17.8% , and 19.9% , respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay, or cancel their contracts at any time. our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors, our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2015 , approximately 40.9% of our revenues was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; embargoes; changes in labor conditions; acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; expropriation of property; tax increases; currency exchanges rate fluctuations; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and page 28 table of contents u.s. government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate, including embargoes or other trade restrictions. the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. in addition, military action or continued unrest, particularly in the middle east, could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. we work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost. some of our services are performed in high risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. in those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors. foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects. our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. these actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. based on fluctuations in currency, the u.s. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies presents a number of risks, including: assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting management's attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or post-acquisition deterioration in an acquired business; difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; difficulties retaining key personnel of an acquired business; increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities; difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business; increased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls; and the potential requirement for additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available, or if available, may not have favorable terms. page 29 table of contents while we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds, and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity. if our management is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy, our operating results could be harmed. in addition, even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. moreover, we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions credit market conditions may also make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. if we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders' individual ownership percentages in the company. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. fluctuations are caused by a number of factors, including: fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; changes in prices of commodities or other supplies; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; natural disasters or other crises; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under u.s. gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; page 30 table of contents recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; estimates of other liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves and reserves necessary for self-insured risks; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions; valuation of stock-based compensation; the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and income tax provisions and related valuation allowances. our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. under u.s. gaap, we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach. as of october 2, 2015 , we had $3.0 billion of goodwill, representing 39.2% of our total assets of $7.8 billion . we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors. if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below. we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage. we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. for example, as of october 2, 2015 , and september 26, 2014 , our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans were projected to be underfunded by $413.1 million and $400.8 million , respectively. see note 6 pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional disclosure. in the future, our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan asset performance and other factors. if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 83.0% during fiscal 2015 ), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. page 31 table of contents we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. for example, there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients. legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. however, these changes could also increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, that could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm. we rely heavily on computer, information, and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. from time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption, or release of data. in addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommunications failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, malicious code, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, or similar events or disruptions. any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property, and results of operations, as well as those of our clients. in addition, we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions, including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients' proprietary or classified information. we rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain all confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems, but they may still be vulnerable to these threats. as a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients. our technology and intellectual property provide us, in many instances, with a competitive advantage. although we protect our property through patent registrations, license restrictions, and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the u.s. if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business. page 32 table of contents in addition, if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control. extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate. as an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity. we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. if we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a negative impact on our operations. in addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits. we are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages. we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services. for example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages. in addition, our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards, licensing requirements, securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed. we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties. these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: our board of directors is divided into three staggered classes (although our board of directors is currently being destaggered); only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares. these types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk page 54 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk please refer to the discussion of the 2014 facility and the 2012 facility in the liquidity and capital resources discussion in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form 10-k, and note 5 - borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k. foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of asc 815-10 - derivatives and hedging in accounting for our derivative contracts. the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.risk factors page 13 risk factors we operate in a changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. if any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we, the owner, or others working at the project site fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials, in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, or if others working at the site fail to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures, our employees and others may become injured, disabled or even lose their lives, the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating and insurance costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and/or criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety and environmental ( hse ) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and page 13 maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. in addition, despite the work of our functional groups, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work, equipment or supplies. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. accordingly, if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards, we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. demand for our services is cyclical as the sectors and industries in which our clients operate are impacted by economic downturns, reductions in government or private spending and times of political uncertainty. we provide technical, professional, construction and o&amp;m services to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries, including oil and gas exploration, production and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; mining and minerals; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; power; water; transportation; and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; and food and consumer products). these sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty. uncertain global economic and political conditions may negatively impact our clients' ability and willingness to fund their projects, including their ability to raise capital and pay, or timely pay, our invoices. they may also cause our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, in the public sector, declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. in addition, under such conditions, many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. these conditions may reduce the demand for our services, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. for example, recent changes to u.s. policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries. the increasing cost of steel and aluminum may impact client spending. we cannot predict the outcome of these changing trade policies or other unanticipated political conditions, nor can we predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients' markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. weak economic conditions, a failure to obtain expected benefits from any increased infrastructure spending, or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry, our business may be disproportionately affected by negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients' markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers' investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. furthermore, declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices, such as the middle east. to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. page 14 commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services. if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards or contractual requirements, we could be exposed to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations. our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. further, even where coverage applies, the policies have deductibles, which result in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us. in addition, clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. an uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost. the market for these and other personnel is competitive. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise, and in the timeframe, demanded by our clients, or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. furthermore, some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects. if we were to lose some or all of these personnel, they would be difficult to replace. loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects. in addition, in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans, which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. if we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition. the price-anderson nuclear industries indemnity act, commonly called the price-anderson act ( paa ), is a u.s. federal law, which, among other things, regulates radioactive materials and the nuclear energy industry, including liability and compensation in the event of nuclear related incidents. the paa provides certain protections and indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and u.s. department of energy ( doe ) contractors. the paa protections and indemnification apply to us as part of our services to the u.s. nuclear energy industry and doe for new facilities, maintenance, modification, decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear energy, weapons and research facilities. we offer similar services in other jurisdictions outside the u.s. for those jurisdictions, varying levels of nuclear liability protection is provided by international treaties, and/or domestic laws, such as the nuclear liability and compensation act of canada and the nuclear installations act of the united kingdom, insurance and/or assets of the nuclear installation operators page 15 (some of which are backed by governments) as well as under appropriate enforceable contractual indemnifications and hold-harmless provisions. these protections and indemnifications, however, may not cover all of our liability that could arise in the performance of these services. to the extent the paa or other protections and indemnifications do not apply to our services, our business could be adversely affected because of the cost of losses associated with liability not covered by the available protections and indemnifications, or by virtue of our loss of business because of these added costs. we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional and construction services to clients. the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional, national and multinational companies. the extent and type of our competition varies by industry, geographic area and project type. for example, with respect to our construction, operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process, which is standard in our industry. we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing, schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services. competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, which may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us, thereby increasing the risk that, among other things, we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we have seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts. our revenues are derived from new contract awards. delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such projects as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our long-term projected results. it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive large-scale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals. since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. furthermore, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and, as a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project. in addition, many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer. as a result, we may incur significant costs for engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer. the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. in some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business. since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients' projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses and other exposures relating to projects page 16 that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. in addition, while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us. with a workforce of approximately 80,000 people globally, we are also party to labor and employment claims in the normal course of business. such claims could relate to allegations of harassment and discrimination, pay equity, denial of benefits, wage and hour violations, whistleblower protections, concerted protected activity, and other employment protections, and may be pursued on an individual or class action basis depending on applicable laws and regulations. some of such claims may be insurable, while other such claims may not. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying coverage limits as well as exclusions for matters such as fraud, and insurance companies may attempt to deny claims for which we seek coverage. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, retentions and limits under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. for example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, coverage that is more limited, or increased premium costs or higher deductibles. we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, which is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. if any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted. in addition, the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients, subcontractors and vendors for, among other things, additional costs exceeding the original contract price. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. further, these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations, arbitration or litigation proceedings, which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims. a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the nature of our contracts, particularly those that are fixed-price, subjects us to risks of cost overruns. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or if the project experiences schedule delays. for fiscal 2018 , approximately 24% of our revenues were earned under fixed-price contracts. both fixed-price and many cost reimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance. for fixed-price contracts, we may benefit from any cost-savings, but we bear greater risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. fixed-price contracts are established in part on partial or incomplete designs, cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, commodity and other materials pricing and availability of labor, equipment and materials and other exigencies. if the design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather or other delays beyond our control, changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials, our vendors' or subcontractors' inability or failure to perform, or changes in general economic conditions, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. these risks are exacerbated for projects with long-term durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. page 17 our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted. like fixed-price contracts, the expected cost of cost-reimbursable projects are based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts. a portion of the fee is often linked to these estimates and the related final cost and schedule objectives, and if for whatever reason these objectives are not met, the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses. the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, canceled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins. backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. as of the end of fiscal 2018 , our backlog totaled approximately $27.3 billion . there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client, including our u.s. government work. in the event of a project cancellation, we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being canceled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices. the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies, which are a significant source of our revenue and profit, are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. legislatures typically appropriate funds on a year-by-year basis, while contract performance may take more than one year. as a result, contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated, and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts. our government clients may reduce the scope of or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (for example, those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 23% of our total revenue in fiscal 2018 ), a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. the u.s. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract. this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. moreover, we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. page 18 in addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies such as the u.s. defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. for example, in so-called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. if our employees or our facilities are unable to obtain or retain the necessary security clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in our industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. further, we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners, including with respect to nonperformance, default, bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance. our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners. differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues, which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures. in addition, in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement. if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights, we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities. we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. third-party subcontractors we hire perform much of the work performed under our contracts. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire page 19 qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability. there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed, customer concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract. in addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. in an uncertain or downturn economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party's ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems, adversely affecting our cost of borrowing and our business. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. instability in the credit markets in the u.s. or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit, which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business. in addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients' ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. some of our customers, suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations. disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients' ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients. in addition, clients may be unable to fund new projects, may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them. our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice. in addition, any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules. these disruptions could materially impact our backlog and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices after we have already committed resources to their projects. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, our clients' unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital. if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, south america, australia and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in page 20 amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that such events may occur in the future. if any such events were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash, which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers. these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety's sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the company's credit-worthiness. because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. in addition, future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock. our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid, and intend to continue paying, regular quarterly dividends. the declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price. past and future environmental, health, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities. we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances, and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws may be joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered or only partially covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. changes in the environmental laws and regulations, remediation obligations, enforcement actions, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. if we fail to page 21 comply with any environmental, health, or safety laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, we could be exposed to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires full compliance with both export regulatory laws and international trafficking in arms regulations ( itar ). although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in u.s. government contracts, and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, regulations pertaining to export control, environmental laws, employee wages, pay and benefits, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or acts of misconduct, could subject us to fines and penalties, cancellation of contracts, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), the u.k. bribery act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances; strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have a material adverse impact on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , approximately 23% , 19% and 21% , respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay or cancel their contracts at any time. our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. page 22 our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2018 , approximately 36% of our revenue was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; potential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, export control and anti-boycott laws and similar non-u.s. laws and regulations; potential non-compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards regarding consumer protection and data use and security, including the general data protection regulation approved by the european union; lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country; renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; embargoes, duties, tariffs or other trade restrictions, including sanctions; changes in labor conditions; acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; expropriation of property; changes to tax policy; currency exchange rate fluctuations; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and u.s. government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate. the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. in addition, military action, geopolitical shifts or continued unrest, particularly in the middle east, could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and increase our security costs. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. we work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost. some of our services are performed in high-risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war, terrorism or civil unrest. in those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors. acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts, or the loss of key employees, contractors or assets. foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects. our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when page 23 there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. these actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency. based on fluctuations in currency, the u.s. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries. our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom's proposed exit from the european union. in june 2016, the u.k. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the e.u., commonly referred to as brexit. as a result of the u.k.'s exit from the e.u., there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the u.k. and e.u. countries and increased regulatory complexities. these changes may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers, employees, and subcontractors, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the ongoing negotiations between the u.k. and the e.u. as to the terms upon which the u.k. will exit from the e.u. and the uncertainty as to their future trade agreement continues to create economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs, terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts, decrease or postpone currently planned contracts, or negotiate for more favorable deal terms, each of which may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies, including ch2m hill companies, ltd., which we acquired in december 2017, presents a number of risks, including: assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; failure of the acquired business to comply with u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and/or contractual requirements with government clients; valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth opportunities; the loss of key customers or suppliers, including as a result of any actual or perceived conflicts of interest; difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting management's attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or post-acquisition deterioration in an acquired business; difficulties relating to assimilating the management, personnel, benefits, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; difficulties retaining key personnel of an acquired business; increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities; difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business; increased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls; the potential requirement for additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available, or if available, may not have favorable terms; and the risks discussed in this item 1a. risk factors that may relate to the activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition. while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses and/or insurance that could mitigate certain of these risks, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the page 24 indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity, or the insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses. if our management is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy, our operating results could be harmed. in addition, even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. moreover, we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions. future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms, or at all. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. if we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders' individual ownership percentages in the company. we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not timely remediated, may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements, and our reputation, business and the price of our common stock, as well as lead to a loss of investor confidence in us. as described under item 9a. controls and procedures below, management has concluded that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, specifically regarding the accounting for income taxes in connection with the ch2m business combination, existed as of september 28, 2018 and, accordingly, internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date. a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. we will take immediate action to remediate this material weakness. while we believe the steps described under item 9a below will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the identified deficiencies, if our remediation efforts are insufficient to address the material weakness or we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to analyze, record and report financial information accurately, to prepare our financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the sec and to otherwise comply with our reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and our long-term debt agreements will likely be adversely affected. the occurrence of, or failure to remediate, this material weakness and any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements and have other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our business, including an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, potential actions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities, possible defaults under our debt agreements, shareholder lawsuits, a loss of investor confidence and damage to our reputation. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or fall below the expectations of securities analysts, which could have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock. fluctuations are caused by a number of factors, including: legal proceedings, disputes and/or government investigations; fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; changes in prices of commodities or other supplies; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; page 25 weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; the decision by the board of directors to begin or cease paying a dividend, and the expectation that if the company pays dividends, it would declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future; natural disasters or other crises; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under u.s. gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; estimates of other liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves and reserves necessary for self-insured risks; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions; valuation of stock-based compensation; the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and income tax provisions and related valuation allowances. our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. an impairment charge on our goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. under u.s. gaap, we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach. as of september 28, 2018 , we had $6.10 billion of goodwill, representing 48.3% of our total assets of $12.65 billion . we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors. if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below. we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage. page 26 we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. for example, as of september 28, 2018 and september 29, 2017 , our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $339.3 million and $252.0 million , respectively. see note 10- pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional disclosure. in the future, our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan asset performance and other factors. if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 76% during fiscal 2018), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients and have other impacts on our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. however, these changes could also increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, that could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, or an ultimate determination that the company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security or privacy breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm. we rely heavily on computer, information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. from time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption, or release of data. in addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommunications failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, malicious code, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions. any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property and results of operations, as well as those of our clients. page 27 in addition, we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions, including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients' proprietary or classified information. while we have security measures and technology in place to protect our and our clients' proprietary or classified information, if these measures fail as a result of a cyber-attack, other third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and someone obtains unauthorized access to our or our clients' information, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. as a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including the european union general data protection regulation, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability. we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. in addition, our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have an adverse effect on our business. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients. our technology and intellectual property provide us, in certain instances, with a competitive advantage. although we protect our property through registration, licensing, contractual arrangements, security controls and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. trade secrets are generally difficult to protect. our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the u.s. if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business. we also hold licenses from third parties which may be utilized in our business operations. if we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control. extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate. as an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of page 28 services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. if we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations. in addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits. we are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages. we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services. for example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages. in addition, our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards, licensing requirements, securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed. we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties. these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares. these types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. risks relating to the sale of our ecr business if the sale of our ecr business to worleyparsons limited is not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses without our stockholders realizing the expected benefits. on october 21, 2018, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement (the purchase agreement ) with worleyparsons limited, a company incorporated in australia ( buyer ), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions therein, we will sell and assign to buyer our energy, chemicals and resources businesses (the ecr business ). completion of the transaction is subject to closing conditions including, but not limited to, various regulatory approvals. we currently expect that the transaction will be completed during the first half of calendar 2019. it is possible, however, that factors outside of our control including, but not limited to, buyer's ability to secure the financing it needs to complete the transaction, could require the parties to complete the transaction at a later time, or not to complete the transaction at all. in the event that the transaction is not consummated for any reason, we will be subject to certain risks, including the costs related to the transaction, such as legal, accounting and advisory fees, which must be paid even if the transaction is not completed. if the transaction is not consummated, the market price of our common stock could decline. we also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the transaction or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the purchase agreement. additionally, if the transaction is not consummated, there may not be an alternative party interested in and able to purchase the ecr business and if an alternative party is identified, such alternative transaction may not result in a comparable aggregate purchase price to what is proposed in this transaction. we will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the transaction is pending. page 29 the pursuit of the transaction and the preparation for the integration of the related assets with buyer may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. additionally, our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain the talents and dedication of our employees and employees may decide not to remain with us while the transaction is pending. any significant diversion of management and employee attention away from ongoing business, loss of employees and difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect our financial results. in addition, the purchase agreement generally requires that we operate the ecr business in theordinary course of business and restricts us from taking certain actions, including selling any assets of the ecr business, prior to the consummation of the transaction or termination of the purchase agreement without buyer's consent. these restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the transaction. additionally, as a result of these business uncertainties, our current and potential business partners may decide to delay, defer or cancel entering into new business arrangements with us pending completion or termination of the transaction. regulatory approvals, including antitrust approval, necessary for closing the purchase agreement may not be received, may take longer than expected or impose conditions that are not presently anticipated. before the transaction may be completed, certain approvals or consents must be obtained from the various regulatory authorities in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which the ecr business operates, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended (the hsr act ), the approvals required pursuant to or in connection with the competition laws of certain foreign jurisdictions in which the ecr business operates and the receipt of approval from the committee on foreign investment in the united states ( cfius ). there can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approvals will be received or the timing of the approvals. buyer is only required to take commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in obtaining regulatory approvals of the transaction. under the purchase agreement, we will be responsible for indemnifying buyer with respect to certain liabilities in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. we have agreed to indemnify buyer for damages resulting from or arising out of any liabilities relating to the ecr business not assumed by buyer in the transaction and for certain other matters. significant indemnification claims by buyer could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. any event that results in a right for buyer to seek indemnity from us under the purchase agreement could result in a substantial payment from us to buyer and could adversely affect our results of operations. we may be held liable to buyer if we fail to perform certain services under the transition services agreement, and the performance of such services may negatively impact our business and operations. we have agreed to enter into a transition services agreement with buyer in connection with the transaction pursuant to which we will provide buyer, on an interim, transitional basis, various services, including, but not limited to, executive consultation services, employee benefits administration, human resources and payroll services, tax services, financial and accounting services, information technology services, regulatory services, project management services for certain client contracts, general administrative services and other support services. if we do not satisfactorily perform our obligations under the agreement, we may be required to re-perform such services at no additional cost. in addition, during the transition services period, our management and employees may be required to divert their attention away from our business in order to provide services to buyer, which could adversely affect our business. because the share consideration component of the purchase price is fixed and the market price of buyer's ordinary shares and the exchange rate between u.s. and australian dollars may fluctuate, we cannot be sure of the value of buyer's ordinary shares that we will receive on the closing date or at the time we seek to sell the ordinary shares. upon completion of the transaction, we will receive 58,197,867 buyer's ordinary shares. the number of buyer's ordinary shares that we will receive in the transaction is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of buyer's ordinary shares or for any changes in the exchange rate between u.s. and australian dollars, which will both likely fluctuate before and after the completion of the transaction. fluctuations in the value of the buyer's ordinary shares could result from changes in their business or the ecr business' operations or prospects, regulatory considerations, general market and economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of us or buyer prior to or following the closing of the transaction. additionally, under the terms of the purchase agreement, the buyer's ordinary shares we receive will be subject to a six-month lock-up period following the transaction's closing during which time we will be unable to sell the ordinary shares and during which time the market price of buyer's ordinary shares and the exchange rate between u.s. and australian dollars will likely fluctuate for the page 30 forgoing reasons, which could result in the ordinary shares we receive having a lower value compared to the value of the ordinary shares at the time we entered into the purchase agreement. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk page 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk please see the note 9- borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of the revolving credit facility, term loan facility and note purchase agreement. our term loan facility, revolving credit facility, and certain other debt obligations are subject to variable rate interest which could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates. as of september 28, 2018 , we had an aggregate of $1.65 billion in outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility and our revolving credit facility. interest on amounts borrowed under these agreements is subject to adjustment based on the company's consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreements governing the term loan facility and revolving credit facility). depending on the company's consolidated leverage ratio, borrowings under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility bear interest at a eurocurrency rate plus a margin of between 1.0% and 1.5% or a base rate plus a margin of between 0% and 0.5%. additionally, if our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a certain amount, the interest on the senior notes may increase by 75 basis points. for the year ended september 28, 2018 , our weighted average floating rate borrowings were approximately $ 2.0 billion. if floating interest rates had increased by 1.00%, our interest expense for the year ended september 28, 2018 would have increased by approximately $ 20.4 million. foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations, where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of asc no. 815, derivatives and hedging in accounting for our derivative contracts. the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.risk factors page 20 risk factors we operate in a changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. if any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. project sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we, the owner, or others working at the project site fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. project sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials, in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations. if we, or others working at such sites, fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, or if others working at the site fail to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures, our employees and others may become injured, disabled or even lose their lives, the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating and insurance costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and/or criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety and environmental ( hse ) work procedures throughout our organization, including project sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. in addition, despite the work of our functional groups, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work, equipment or supplies. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. accordingly, if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards, we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. past and future environmental, health, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities. we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances, and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws may be joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. page 20 when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered or only partially covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. changes in the environmental laws and regulations, remediation obligations, enforcement actions, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. if we fail to comply with any environmental, health, or safety laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, we could be exposed to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations. our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts. our revenues are derived from new contract awards. delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such projects as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our long-term projected results. it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive large-scale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals. since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. furthermore, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and, as a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project. in addition, many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer. as a result, we may incur significant costs for engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer. the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. in some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional and construction management services to clients. the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional, national and multinational companies. the extent and type of our competition varies by industry, geographic area and project type. our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process, which is standard in our industry. we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing, schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services. competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, which may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us, thereby increasing the risk that, among other things, we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we have seen in the past or may page 21 become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the nature of our contracts, particularly those that are fixed-price, subjects us to risks of cost overruns. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or if the project experiences schedule delays. for fiscal 2019 , approximately 24% of our revenues were earned under fixed-price contracts. both fixed-price and many cost reimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance. for fixed-price contracts, we may benefit from any cost-savings, but we bear greater risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. fixed-price contracts are established in part on partial or incomplete designs, cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, commodity and other materials pricing and availability of labor, equipment and materials and other exigencies. if the design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather or other delays beyond our control, changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials, our vendors' or subcontractors' inability or failure to perform, or changes in general economic conditions, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. these risks are exacerbated for projects with long-term durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted. like fixed-price contracts, the expected cost of cost-reimbursable projects are based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts. a portion of the fee is often linked to these estimates and the related final cost and schedule objectives, and if for whatever reason these objectives are not met, the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses. the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have a material adverse impact on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , approximately 27% , 32% and 30% , respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay or cancel their contracts at any time. our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, canceled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins. backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. as of the end of fiscal 2019 , our backlog totaled approximately $22.6 billion . there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client, including our u.s. government work. in the event of a project cancellation, we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being canceled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices. page 22 the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies, which are a significant source of our revenue and profit, are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. u.s. government shutdowns or any related under-staffing of the government departments or agencies that interact with our business could result in program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders, could limit the government's ability to effectively progress programs and make timely payments, and could limit our ability to perform on our existing u.s. government contracts and successfully compete for new work. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. legislatures typically appropriate funds on a year-by-year basis, while contract performance may take more than one year. as a result, contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated, and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts. our government clients may reduce the scope of or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (for example, those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 27% of our total revenue in fiscal 2019 ), a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. the u.s. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract. this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. moreover, we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies such as the u.s. defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. page 23 if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. for example, in so-called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. the occurrence of any of these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. if our employees or our facilities are unable to obtain or retain the necessary security clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services. if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards or contractual requirements, we could be exposed to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations. our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. further, even where coverage applies, the policies have deductibles, which result in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us. in addition, clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. an uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business, including litigation inherited through acquisitions. since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients' projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. in addition, while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us. with a workforce of approximately 52,000 people globally, we are also party to labor and employment claims in the normal course of business. such claims could relate to allegations of harassment and discrimination, pay equity, denial of benefits, wage and hour violations, whistleblower protections, concerted protected activity, and other employment protections, and may be pursued on an individual or class action basis depending on applicable laws and regulations. some of such claims may be insurable, while other such claims may not. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying coverage limits as well as exclusions for matters such as fraud, and insurance companies may attempt to deny claims for which we seek coverage. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, retentions and limits under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. page 24 although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. for example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, coverage that is more limited, or increased premium costs or higher deductibles. we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, which is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. if any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted. in addition, the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients, subcontractors and vendors for, among other things, additional costs exceeding the original contract price. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. further, these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations, arbitration or litigation proceedings, which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims. a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in our industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. further, we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners, including with respect to nonperformance, default, bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance. our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners. differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues, which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures. in addition, in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement. if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights, we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities. we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. page 25 we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. third-party subcontractors we hire perform much of the work performed under our contracts. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability. there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed, customer concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract. in addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. in an uncertain or downturn economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party's ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, regulations pertaining to export control, environmental laws, employee wages, pay and benefits, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or acts of misconduct, could subject us to fines and penalties, cancellation of contracts, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires full compliance with both export regulatory laws and international trafficking in arms regulations ( itar ). although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in u.s. government contracts, and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business. page 26 we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), the u.k. bribery act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances; strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2019 , approximately 29% of our revenue was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; potential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, export control and anti-boycott laws and similar non-u.s. laws and regulations; potential non-compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards regarding consumer protection and data use and security, including the general data protection regulation approved by the european union; lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country; renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; embargoes, duties, tariffs or other trade restrictions, including sanctions; changes in labor conditions; acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; expropriation of property; changes to tax policy; currency exchange rate fluctuations; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and u.s. government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate. the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. in addition, military action, geopolitical shifts or continued unrest, particularly in the middle east, could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and increase our security costs. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. page 27 we work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost. some of our services are performed in high-risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war, terrorism or civil unrest. in those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors. acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts, or the loss of key employees, contractors or assets. systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security or privacy breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm. we rely heavily on computer, information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. from time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption, or release of data. in addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommunications failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, malicious code, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions. any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property and results of operations, as well as those of our clients. in addition, we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware, phishing, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions, including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients' proprietary or classified information. in addition, such tactics may also seek to cause payments due to or from the company to be misdirected to fraudulent accounts, which may not be recoverable by the company. while we have security measures and technology in place to protect our and our clients' proprietary or classified information, if these measures fail as a result of a cyber-attack, other third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and someone obtains unauthorized access to our or our clients' information, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. as a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability. we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. in addition, our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have an adverse effect on our business. page 28 we are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages. we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services. for example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages. in addition, our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards, licensing requirements, securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed. we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties. these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients. our technology and intellectual property provide us, in certain instances, with a competitive advantage. although we protect our property through registration, licensing, contractual arrangements, security controls and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. trade secrets are generally difficult to protect. our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the u.s. if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert leadership's attention away from other aspects of our business. we also hold licenses from third parties which may be utilized in our business operations. if we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or fall below the expectations of securities analysts, which could have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock. fluctuations are caused by a number of factors, including: legal proceedings, disputes and/or government investigations; fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; changes in prices of commodities or other supplies; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; page 29 the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; the decision by the board of directors to begin or cease paying a dividend, and the expectation that if the company pays dividends, it would declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future; natural disasters or other crises; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. if we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the price-anderson nuclear industries indemnity act, commonly called the price-anderson act ( paa ), is a u.s. federal law, which, among other things, regulates radioactive materials and the nuclear energy industry, including liability and compensation in the event of nuclear related incidents. the paa provides certain protections and indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and u.s. department of energy ( doe ) contractors. the paa protections and indemnification apply to us as part of our services to the u.s. nuclear energy industry and doe for new facilities, maintenance, modification, decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear energy, weapons and research facilities. we offer similar services in other jurisdictions outside the u.s. for those jurisdictions, varying levels of nuclear liability protection is provided by international treaties, and/or domestic laws, such as the nuclear liability and compensation act of canada and the nuclear installations act of the united kingdom, insurance and/or assets of the nuclear installation operators (some of which are backed by governments) as well as under appropriate enforceable contractual indemnifications and hold-harmless provisions. these protections and indemnifications, however, may not cover all of our liability that could arise in the performance of these services. to the extent the paa or other protections and indemnifications do not apply to our services, the cost of losses associated with liability not covered by the available protections and indemnifications, or by virtue of our loss of business because of these added costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our leadership is required under u.s. gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our leadership include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; estimates of other liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves and reserves necessary for self-insured risks; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions and ongoing assessment of impairment; valuation of stock-based compensation; the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; income tax provisions and related valuation allowances; and valuation of investment in worley stock. our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. page 30 an impairment charge on our goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. under u.s. gaap, we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach. as of september 27, 2019 , we had $5.43 billion of goodwill, representing 47.4% of our total assets of $11.46 billion . we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors. if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below. there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock. our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid, and intend to continue paying, regular quarterly dividends. the declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price. we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage. we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. for example, as of september 27, 2019 and september 28, 2018 , our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $399.8 million and $339.3 million , respectively. see note 12- pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional disclosure. in the future, our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan asset performance and other factors. if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. page 31 negotiations with labor unions and possible work actions could disrupt operations and increase labor costs and operating expenses. a certain portion of our work force has entered into collective bargaining agreements which on occasion may require renegotiation. the outcome of future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements may not be favorable to the company in that they may increase our operating expenses and lower our net income as a result of higher wages or benefit expenses. in addition, negotiations with unions could divert management attention and disrupt operations, which may adversely affect our results of operations. if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, we may have to address the threat of union-initiated work actions, including strikes. depending on the nature of the threat or the type and duration of any work action, these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. demand for our services is cyclical as the sectors and industries in which our clients operate are impacted by economic downturns, reductions in government or private spending and times of political uncertainty. we provide full spectrum technical and professional solutions to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries, including programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; aerospace; automotive; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; environmental and nuclear; buildings; smart cities; power; water; transportation; telecom and other general industrial and consumer businesses and sectors. these sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty. uncertain global economic and political conditions may negatively impact our clients' ability and willingness to fund their projects, including their ability to raise capital and pay, or timely pay, our invoices. they may also cause our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, in the public sector, declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. in addition, under such conditions, many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. these conditions may reduce the demand for our services, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. for example, recent changes to u.s. policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries. the increasing cost of steel and aluminum may impact client spending. we cannot predict the outcome of these changing trade policies or other unanticipated political conditions, nor can we predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients' markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. weak economic conditions, a failure to obtain expected benefits from any increased infrastructure spending, or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry, our business may be disproportionately affected by negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients' markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. page 32 our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom's proposed exit from the european union. in june 2016, the u.k. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the e.u., commonly referred to as brexit. as a result of the u.k.'s exit from the e.u., there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the u.k. and e.u. countries and increased regulatory complexities. these changes may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers, employees, and subcontractors, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the ongoing negotiations between the u.k. and the e.u. as to the terms upon which the u.k. will exit from the e.u. and the uncertainty as to their future trade agreement continues to create economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs, terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts, decrease or postpone currently planned contracts, or negotiate for more favorable deal terms, each of which may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely on cash provided by operations and liquidity under our credit facilities to fund our business. negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could adversely affect our cost of borrowing and our business. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. we are currently a borrower under several credit facilities. these facilities all contain customary covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to incur certain liens and indebtedness. we are also subject to certain financial covenants, including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. a breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under one or more of our credit facilities and limit our ability to do further borrowing. instability in the credit markets in the u.s. or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit, which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business. in addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients' ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. some of our customers, suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations. disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients' ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients. in addition, clients may be unable to fund new projects, may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them. our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice. in addition, any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules. these disruptions could materially impact our backlog and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices after we have already committed resources to their projects. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, our clients' unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital. if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. page 33 furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, south america, australia and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that such events may occur in the future. if any such events were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash, which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers. these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety's sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the company's credit-worthiness. because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. in addition, future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 76% during fiscal 2019 ), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects. our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. these actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency. based on fluctuations in currency, the u.s. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries. page 34 our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, or an ultimate determination that the company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients and have other impacts on our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. however, these changes could also increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, that could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control. extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate. as an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. if we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations. in addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers' investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. furthermore, declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices, such as the middle east. to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. page 35 our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel and corporate leadership professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost. the market for these and other personnel is competitive. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise, and in the timeframe, demanded by our clients, or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. furthermore, some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects. if we were to lose some or all of these personnel, they would be difficult to replace. loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and leadership personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects. in addition, in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans, which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies, including ch2m hill companies, ltd., which we acquired in december 2017 and keyw, which we acquired in june 2019, presents a number of risks, including: assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; failure of the acquired business to comply with u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and/or contractual requirements with government clients; valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth opportunities; the loss of key customers or suppliers, including as a result of any actual or perceived conflicts of interest; difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting leadership's attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or post-acquisition deterioration in an acquired business; difficulties relating to assimilating the leadership, personnel, benefits, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; difficulties retaining key personnel of an acquired business; increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities; difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business; page 36 increased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls; the potential requirement for additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available, or if available, may not have favorable terms; and the risks discussed in this item 1a. risk factors that may relate to the activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition. while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses and/or insurance that could mitigate certain of these risks, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity, or the insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses. if our leadership is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy, our operating results could be harmed. in addition, even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. moreover, we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions. future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms, or at all. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. acquisitions and divestitures create various business risks and uncertainties during the pendency of the transaction. consummation of any merger or divestiture is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including one or more of the following: (i) due diligence and its associated time and cost commitments, (ii) board and shareholder approval, (iii) regulatory approvals, (iv) the absence of any legal restraint that would prevent the consummation of the transaction, (v) the absence of material adverse conditions which can prevent the consummation of the transaction, and (vi) compliance with covenants and the accuracy of representations and warranties contained in the transaction agreement, among others. one or more of these conditions may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the transaction may not be consummated or may be significantly delayed. in such case, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline, particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be consummated or will be consummated within a particular timeframe. furthermore, most transactions require the company to incur substantial expense associated with closing and if the transaction is not consummated, we will incur these expenses without realizing the expected benefits. the pursuit of the transaction will also require management attention and use of internal resources that would otherwise be focused on general business operations. in addition, customers' uncertainty about the effect of the transaction may have an adverse effect on the ability to win customer contracts, or could cause existing clients to seek to change existing business relationships. employee morale due to the uncertainties associated with the transaction could also be negatively affected. any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with a failure or delay in consummating a transaction, including the diversion of management attention or loss of other opportunities during the pendency of the transaction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership, and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture, the value of stock is subject to fluctuation. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. if we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders' individual ownership percentages in the company. page 37 in addition, if we receive stock or other equity securities in connection with a sale or divestiture of a business, the value of such stock will fluctuate and/or be subject to trading restrictions. stock price changes may result from, among other things, changes in the business, operations or prospects of the issuer prior to or following the transaction, litigation or regulatory considerations, general business, market, industry or economic conditions, the ability to sell all or a portion of the stock based on current market conditions, and other factors both within and beyond the control of the company. in addition, if the stock received is valued in a currency other than u.s. dollars, the value of such stock will also fluctuate based on foreign currency rates. for example, in connection with the ecr sale, the company received 58.2 million ordinary shares of worley as a portion of the purchase price. approximately 51.3 million of such shares are subject to a lock-up period that expires in december 2019. the value of such shares will fluctuate based on the trading price of the worley shares on the australian securities exchange and the exchange rate of the australian dollar. we may be held liable to worley under the ecr sale agreement if we fail to perform certain services under the transition services agreement, and the performance of such services may negatively impact our business and operations. we have entered into a transition services agreement ("tsa") with worley in connection with the sale of our ecr business pursuant to which we will provide worley, on an interim, transitional basis, various services, including, but not limited to, executive consultation services, employee benefits administration, human resources and payroll services, tax services, financial and accounting services, information technology services, regulatory services, project management services for certain client contracts, general administrative services and other support services. if we do not satisfactorily perform our obligations under the agreement, we may be required to re-perform such services at no additional cost. in addition, during the transition services period, our leadership and employees may be required to divert their attention away from our business in order to provide services to worley, which could adversely affect our business. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares. these types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk page 61 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk please see the note 10- borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of the new credit agreement, term loan facility and note purchase agreement. our term loan facility, new credit agreement and certain other debt obligations are subject to variable rate interest which could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates. as of september 27, 2019 , we had an aggregate of $703.8 million in outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility and our new credit agreement. interest on amounts borrowed under these agreements is subject to adjustment based on the c ompany's consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreements governing the term loan facility and new credit agreement). depending on the company's consolidated leverage ratio, borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest at a eurocurrency rate plus a margin of between 1.0% and 1.5% or a base rate plus a margin of between 0% and 0.5% and borrowings under the new credit agreement bear interest at a eurocurrency rate plus a margin of between 0.875% and 1.5% or a base rate plus a margin of between 0% and 0.5%. additionally, if our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a certain amount, the interest on the senior notes may increase by 75 basis points. for the year ended september 27, 2019 , our weighted average floating rate borrowings were approximately $ 1.6 billion. if floating interest rates had increased by 1.00%, our interest expense for the year ended september 27, 2019 would have increased by approximately $ 16.6 million. page 61 jacobs engineering group inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations, where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of asc no. 815, derivatives and hedging in accounting for our derivative contracts. the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.risk factors page 28 risk factors that may relate to the activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition. while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses and/or insurance that could mitigate certain of these risks, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity, or the insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses. if our leadership is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy, our operating results could be harmed. in addition, even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. moreover, we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. existing cash balances and cash flow from

conditions may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the transaction may not be consummated or may be significantly delayed. in such case, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock page 46 may decline, particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be consummated or will be consummated within a particular timeframe. furthermore, most transactions require the company to incur substantial expense associated with closing and if the transaction is not consummated, we will incur these expenses without realizing the expected benefits. the pursuit of the transaction will also require management attention and use of internal resources that would otherwise be focused on general business operations. in addition, customers' uncertainty about the effect of the transaction may have an adverse effect on the ability to win customer contracts, or could cause existing clients to seek to change existing business relationships. employee morale due to the uncertainties associated with the transaction could also be negatively affected. any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with a failure or delay in consummating a transaction, including the diversion of management attention or loss of other opportunities during the pendency of the transaction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. risks related to regulatory compliance past and future environmental, health, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities. we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances, and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws may be joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered or only partially covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. changes in the environmental laws and regulations, remediation obligations, enforcement actions, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. if we fail to comply with any environmental, health, or safety laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, we could be exposed to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations. page 47 if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires full compliance with both export regulatory laws and international trafficking in arms regulations ( itar ). although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in u.s. government contracts, and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business. we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), the u.k. bribery act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances; strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients and have other impacts on our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. however, these changes could also increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, that could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. risks related to our indebtedness we rely on cash provided by operations and liquidity under our credit facilities to fund our business. negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could adversely affect our cost of borrowing and our business. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. we are currently a borrower under several credit facilities. these facilities all contain customary covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to incur certain liens and indebtedness. we are also subject to certain financial covenants, including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. a breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under one or more of our credit facilities and limit our ability to do further borrowing. instability in the credit markets in the u.s. or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit, which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business. in addition, market conditions page 48 could negatively impact our clients' ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. some of our customers, suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations. disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients' ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients. in addition, clients may be unable to fund new projects, may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them. our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice. in addition, any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules. these disruptions could materially impact our backlog and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices after we have already committed resources to their projects. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, our clients' unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital. if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, south america, australia and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that such events may occur in the future. if any such events were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash, which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers. these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety's sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the company's credit-worthiness. because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. in addition, future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. page 49 risks related to our common stock our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or fall below the expectations of securities analysts, which could have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock. fluctuations are caused by a number of factors, including: legal proceedings, disputes and/or government investigations; fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; changes in prices of commodities or other supplies; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; the decision by the board of directors to begin or cease paying a dividend, and the expectation that if the company pays dividends, it would declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future; natural disasters or other crises; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock. our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid, and intend to continue paying, regular quarterly dividends. the declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership, and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture, the value of stock is subject to fluctuation. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. if we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders' individual ownership percentages in the company. page 50 in addition, if we receive stock or other equity securities in connection with a sale or divestiture of a business, the value of such stock will fluctuate and/or be subject to trading restrictions. stock price changes may result from, among other things, changes in the business, operations or prospects of the issuer prior to or following the transaction, litigation or regulatory considerations, general business, market, industry or economic conditions, the ability to sell all or a portion of the stock based on current market conditions, and other factors both within and beyond the control of the company. in addition, if the stock received is valued in a currency other than u.s. dollars, the value of such stock will also fluctuate based on foreign currency rates. for example, in connection with the ecr sale, the company still holds 51.3 million ordinary shares of worley received as a portion of the purchase price. the value of such shares will fluctuate based on the trading price of the worley shares on the australian securities exchange and the exchange rate of the australian dollar. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares. these types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. page 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk page 76 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk please see the note 9- borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of the revolving credit facility and note purchase agreement. our revolving credit facility, 2020 term loan facility and certain other debt obligations are subject to variable rate interest which could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates. as of october 2, 2020, we had an aggregate of $1.2 billion in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 2020 term loan facility. interest on amounts borrowed under these agreements is subject to adjustment based on the c ompany's consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreements governing the revolving credit facility and the 2020 term loan facility). depending on the company's consolidated leverage ratio, borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the 2020 term loan facility bear interest at a eurocurrency rate plus a margin of between 0.875% and 1.5% or a base rate plus a margin of between 0% and 0.5%. additionally, if our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a certain amount, the interest on the senior notes may increase by 75 basis points. however, as discussed in note 17- commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instrument s, we have entered into swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $911.5 million t o convert the variab le rate interest based liabilities associated with a corresponding amount of our debt into fixed interest rate liabilities, leaving $267.1 million in principal amount subject to variable interest rate risk. for the year ended october 2, 2020, our weighted average floating rate borrowings were approximately $1.2 billion. if floating interest rates had increased by 1.00%, our interest expense for the year ended october 2, 2020 would have increased by approximately $12.2 million. foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of asc no. 815, derivatives and hedging in accounting for our derivative contracts. the company has $521.5 million in notional value of exchange rate sensitive instruments at october 2, 2020. see note 17- commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments for discussion. page 76qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes. in the normal course of business, the company results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk our only source for long-term credit are two revolving credit agreements totaling $275.0 million. the total amounts outstanding under these facilities at september 30, 2002 was $85.7 million. both agreements expire in january 2004 and provide for both fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings. our objectives in managing our interest rate risk is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to lower our overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we maintain fixed rate debt on a majority of our borrowings and minimize our outstanding borrowings by paying down debt from cash provided from operations. foreign currency risk in general, the company exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no. 52 foreign currency translation in preparing its consolidated financial statements. we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because, generally speaking, our various operations invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies. in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies, we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. page 17quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 29

million). the purpose of the contract was to hedge the company foreign currency exchange exposure on a &pound;39.9 million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries. regardless of the degree to which the value of british sterling may decline against the u.s. dollar, the maximum potential effect on our future earnings will be limited to $5.0 million. the forward contract

with another u.s. bank which fixes the effective rate of interest on &pound;34.0 million (then, approximately $61.1 million) of bank debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the babtie group. this instrument allows us to receive a floating rate payment tied to the 3-month libor plus a spread from the counterparty, in exchange for a fixed-rate payment from us. both of the aforementioned contracts qualify as cash flow hedges under the provisions sfas no. 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities .risk factors 17 risk factors we engage in a highly competitive business. increased competition for professional services could reduce our market share and profits. there is intense competition to provide professional engineering, design, architectural, program management, systems consulting, construction and construction management services. the extent of our competition varies according to the industries and markets we serve as well as the geographic areas in which we operate. the degree and type of competition we face in the marketplace is also often influenced by the type and scope of projects for which we compete. for example, with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects (e.g., large design-build and program management projects) to large contractors. some of our competitors are larger than us and may possess greater resources than we do, which may give them an advantage when bidding for certain of these large projects. conversely, the relatively small amount of capital required for a business providing engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services creates a relative ease of market entry for a new entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications and certifications. accordingly, our competitors range from small, regional firms to large, national and international organizations. if we are unable to compete effectively in the geographic areas in which we operate, we may experience a loss of market share and reduced profitability. our larger competitors for engineering, construction, and maintenance services for process plants include the bechtel group, inc., fluor corporation, foster wheeler corp., washington group international, kellogg brown &amp; root, aker kvaerner, technip, and amec plc. in the area of buildings, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr, inc., hellmuth, obata &amp; kassabaum, aecom technology, turner construction, and day &amp; zimmermann. in the area of infrastructure, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff, urs corporation, hntb, and w.s. atkins. in the area of u.s. federal programs, our principal competitors include several of the companies listed above as well as the shaw group, saic, ch2m hill, weston solutions, lockheed martin corporation, tetra tech, and computer sciences corporation. and in the area of pulp and paper, our principal competitors include be&amp;k, and amec plc. our continued success is dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. there is intense demand for employees able to perform the services we provide. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, and corporate management professionals, who have the necessary and required experience and expertise. in addition, there is significant demand for qualified craft personnel in the geographic areas where our construction and maintenance sites are located. in certain geographic page 17 table of contents areas we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. if we cannot find and retain highly qualified and trained engineers, architects, designers and corporate management employees or hire skilled craft personnel as needed, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins or gross profits. at september 30, 2006, our backlog totaled approximately $9.8 billion. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client. in addition, our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the amount of backlog in-hand at september 30, 2006 will actually be realized as revenues. the gross margins (i.e., contract revenue less direct costs of contracts) can vary considerably between contracts. one aspect of our business that can have a significant effect on the gross margins we realize on our contracts and projects is the amount of pass-through costs incurred. when we are directly responsible for engineering, design, procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client plant or facility, we reflect the costs of materials, equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs. on other projects, where the client elects to pay for such items directly, and we have no associated responsibility for such items, these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs. since pass-through costs typically do not bring significant margins with them, it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding change in our gross margins. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as: achievement of target completion dates or target costs; overall safety performance; overall client satisfaction, and/or other performance criteria. if we subsequently fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no guarantee that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risk relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls. in the u.s., government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with congressional funding. the u.s. federal government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for a program may even be eliminated. in addition, u.s. government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements. for example, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act and department of defense security regulations. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. if we fail to comply with any of these regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing government contracts could be terminated, and we could be temporarily suspended or even debarred from government contracting or subcontracting. page 18 table of contents we also run the risk of the effects of government audits, investigations and proceedings, and so-called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act that, if an unfavorable result occurs, could impact our profits and financial condition, as well as our ability to obtain future government work. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors. if these agencies determine that a rule or regulation has been violated, a variety of penalties can be imposed including criminal and civil penalties all of which would harm our reputation with the government or even debar us from future government activities. if one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason including for convenience, if we are suspended from government contract work, or if payment of our costs is disallowed, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits. we bear the risk of cost overruns in approximately 10% of the dollar-value of our contracts. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. for the year ended september 30, 2006, approximately 10% of our revenues was earned under contracts that were either fixed-price or guaranteed maximum price in nature. for such contracts, we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. under these fixed price and guaranteed maximum price contracts, contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates which are based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, or circumstances change such as unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, cost of raw materials or our suppliers or subcontractors inability to perform, cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. ambiguities as to contract specifications can also lead to cost-overruns. international operations, unfavorable political developments, natural disasters and weak foreign economies may seriously harm our financial condition. for the year ended september 30, 2006, approximately 35% of our revenues were earned from unaffiliated clients outside the united states. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. at a minimum, our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. in addition, our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions in foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade restrictions; acts of war and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political and economic instability; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and natural disasters or other crises, such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome commonly known as sars or avian bird flu. page 19 table of contents our business is dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, and we are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets in which are clients operate. we provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; long-term programs for various national governments, including the united states; chemicals and polymers; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; technology and manufacturing; and pulp and paper, among others. these individual markets are generally cyclical in nature. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to unanticipated downturns in our clients markets and industries. as a result, our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the industries listed above, and the geographic regions in which we operate. rising inflation, interest rates and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed price contracts. because a significant portion of our revenues is earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (90%, 85%, and 83% during fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively) the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximum-price. in addition, rising inflation, interest rates and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. furthermore, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates and/or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. our strategic plan relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our strategic plan involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. such growth involves a number of risks, including: difficulties relating to combining previously separate businesses into a single, combined unit; diversion of management attention from day-to-day operations; the assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including unforeseen liabilities; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services and systems of an acquired business and to integrating marketing and other operational capabilities; and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business. in addition, we cannot assure you that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity page 20 table of contents securities. if we do issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders individual ownership percentages in the company. the outcome of pending and future claims, and litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business. the nature of our business results in clients, subcontractors and vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible. similarly, and in the normal course of business, we occasionally present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible. if we fail to properly document the nature of our claims or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, vendors and subcontractors, we could incur cost overruns and experience reduced profits or, in some cases, suffer a loss for that project. in the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. generally, such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance. most of the litigation in which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers compensation, personal injury, environmental, employment/labor, professional liability, and other similar lawsuits. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. however, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs which may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms; only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares. these types of provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders. accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 36 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk our only source for long-term credit is a $290.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility. the total amount outstanding under this facility at september 30, 2006 was $77.7 million. this agreement expires in december 2010, and provides for both fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings. our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to lower our overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we continuously monitor changes in interest rates, and use cash provided from operations to re-pay our borrowings as quickly as possible. furthermore, the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. foreign currency risk in general, our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. we follow the provisions of sfas no. 52 foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements. we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because, in general, our various operations invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies. in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies, we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs, or when appropriate, enter into foreign currency hedges to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. at september 30, 2006, the company had 11 million (approximately $14.0 million) of forward contracts outstanding relating to such contract revenues. concurrent with the acquisition of the babtie group, we entered into a forward contract with a large, u.s. bank in the notional amount of &pound;39.9 million (then, approximately $73.4 million). the purpose of the contract is to hedge the company exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on a &pound;39.9 million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries. based on the terms of the contract, we believe the effect of the loan on future earnings at september 30, 2006 should be limited to $3.4 million of expense. in addition, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement with another u.s. bank which fixes the effective rate of interest on certain bank debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the babtie group. at september 30, 2006, the notional amount of this hedge was &pound;20.1 million (approximately $37.7 million). this instrument allows us to receive a floating rate payment tied to the 3-month libor plus a spread from the counterparty, in exchange for a fixed-rate payment from us. both of the aforementioned contracts qualify as cash flow hedges under the provisions sfas no. 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities . page 36 table of contentsrisk factors 18 risk factors we engage in a highly competitive

of the project. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns and experience reduced profits or, in some cases, suffer a loss for that project. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change-orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change-orders can be significant. in the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. generally, such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance. most of the litigation in which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers compensation; personal injury; environmental; employment/labor; professional liability; and other similar lawsuits. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. however, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs which may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. construction sites and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal proceedings. construction sites and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. construction and maintenance projects often require putting our employees in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly-regulated materials. on those projects where we are responsible for site safety, we are obligated to implement procedures to ensure that workers are not injured. in the event we either fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and other may become injured, and we could incur significant financial losses. in addition, the company could be found liable for failing to comply with government regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. 19 table of contents regulations dealing with occupational health and safety are continually evolving. we maintain functional groups within the company whose primary purpose is to ensure that effective health, safety, and environmental (hse) work procedures are implemented throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites. in spite of these efforts, the company could suffer losses relating to safety issues at our construction and maintenance sites, or fail to comply with all hse regulations applicable to our business. we perform certain contracts through partnerships and joint ventures. participation in joint ventures exposes us to certain other risks and uncertainties. as is common in the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with other contractors through various forms of joint ventures, including general partnerships. these arrangements expose us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may not be able to fulfill their obligations under the partnership agreements and related client contracts. there is also a risk that our partners may be incapable of providing the required financial support to the partnerships. disputes can arise not only between us and our joint venture partners, but also between the joint ventures and the clients. the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins. at september 30, 2007, our backlog totaled approximately $13.6 billion. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client. in addition, our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. accordingly, there is no assurance that the amount of backlog in-hand at september 30, 2007 will actually be realized as revenues. the gross margins (i.e., contract revenue less direct costs of contracts) can vary considerably between contracts. one aspect of our business that can have a significant effect on the gross margins we realize on our contracts and projects is the amount of pass-through costs incurred. when we are directly responsible for engineering, design, procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client plant or facility, we reflect the costs of materials, equipment, and subcontracts in both revenues and costs. on other projects, where the client elects to pay for such items directly, and we have no associated responsibility for such items, these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs. since pass-through costs typically do not bring significant margins with them, it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding change in our gross margins. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs; overall safety performance; overall client satisfaction; and/or other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. our business is dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, and we are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate. we provide technical professional, and construction services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; long-term programs for various national governments, including the u.s.; chemicals and polymers; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; food and consumer products; and mining and minerals). these individual markets are generally cyclical in nature. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we 20 table of contents are therefore vulnerable to unanticipated downturns in our clients markets and industries. as a result, our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the industries listed above, and the geographic regions in which we operate. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the united states and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls. in the u.s., government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with congressional funding. the u.s. federal government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for a program may even be eliminated. in addition, u.s. government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements. for example, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and department of defense security regulations. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. if we fail to comply with any of these regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing government contracts could be terminated, and we could be temporarily suspended or even debarred from government contracting or subcontracting. we also run the risk of the effects of government audits, investigations and proceedings, and so-called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act that, if an unfavorable result occurs, could impact our profits and financial condition, as well as our ability to obtain future government work. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors. if these agencies determine that a rule or regulation has been violated, a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages, and criminal and civil penalties, all of which would harm our reputation with the government or even debar us from future government activities. if one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason including for convenience, if we are suspended from government contract work, or if payment of our costs is disallowed, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits. we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price and guaranteed maximum price contracts (these contracts accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2007 revenues). we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. for the year ended september 30, 2007, approximately 12% of our revenues was earned under contracts that were either fixed-price or guaranteed maximum price in nature. for such contracts, we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. under fixed price and guaranteed maximum-price contracts, contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates which are based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, or if circumstances change such as unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, cost of raw materials or our suppliers or subcontractors inability to perform, cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications can also lead to cost-overruns. 21 table of contents international operations, unfavorable political developments, natural disasters and weak foreign economies may seriously harm our financial condition. for the year ended september 30, 2007, approximately 41% of our revenues was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. at a minimum, our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. in addition, our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions in foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade restrictions; acts of war and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political and economic instability; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and natural disasters or other crises, such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome commonly known as sars or avian bird flu. rising inflation, interest rates and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed price contracts. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 88% during fiscal 2007) the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximum-price. in addition, rising inflation, interest rates and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. furthermore, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates and/or construction costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. such growth involves a number of risks, including: difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a combined, integrated, and efficient business; diversion of management attention from day-to-day operations; assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition transaction was negotiated; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; 22 table of contents potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition; difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. should we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders individual ownership percentages in the company. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms; only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares. these types of provisions, as well as our shareholder rights agreement, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders. accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 39 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk our only source for long-term credit is a $290.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility. the total amount outstanding under this facility at september 30, 2007 was $40.5 million. this agreement expires in may 2012, and provides for both fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings. our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to lower our overall 39 table of contents borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we continuously monitor changes in interest rates, and use cash provided from operations to re-pay our borrowings as quickly as possible. furthermore, the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of sfas no. 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accounting for our derivative contracts. at september 30, 2007, we had the following derivative contracts outstanding ( usd refers to u.s. dollar; gbp , the british pound; bhd , the bahraini dinar): hedge instrument notional amount rate settlement year euro put option 4,419,000 0.8105 / usd 2008 bahraini dinar forward bhd 4,690,000 0.7527 / gbp 2008 euro put option 13,200,000 1.4522 / gbp 2009 british pound forward &pound; 520,000 1.3300 / bhd 2008 concurrent with the acquisition of the babtie group, we entered into a forward contract with a large, u.s. bank. the purpose of the contract is to hedge the company exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on a &pound;39.9 million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries. based on the terms of the contract, we believe the effect of the loan on future earnings at september 30, 2007 should be limited to $2.7 million of expense. at september 30, 2007, the notional amount of the contract was &pound;39.9 million. it provides for an average exchange rate of 0.5828 gbp-to usd, and terminates in fiscal 2011. this derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the provisions of sfas 133.risk factors 18 risk factors construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities. construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. on many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured. this could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental (hse) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. as a result, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 18 table of contents negative conditions in the credit markets could impair our ability to operate our business and implement our acquisition strategy although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. in addition, from time to time our clients depend of the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects. due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the u.s. and abroad, the availability of credit has continued to tighten in spite of government efforts to increase liquidity and hold or reduce interest rates. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. this situation may inhibit our growth and could negatively impact our clients ability to fund their projects, resulting in our loss of revenues. we routinely enter into contracts with counterparties (including vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors) that may be negatively impacted by recent events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could impact our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a diminution in our clients access to the credit markets. if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition. additional discussion of some of the risks associated with the current economic downturn can be found in item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , below. our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. there is intense demand for these employees. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified craft personnel. in addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we also need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns and reduced profits. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts and that could, if significant enough, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are also subject to claims for not fulfilling guarantees relating to, among other things, project schedules, and plant performance. 19 table of contents in addition, we become a party to litigation in the normal course of business. most litigation with which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers compensation, personal injury, environmental, employment/labor, professional liability, and similar matters. such lawsuits may relate to current or completed projects and may be brought by our clients as well as those who use or reside near our clients projects. if a lawsuit is determined contrary to our interests, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. our insurers are subject to business risk. one or more of our insurers may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise. to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted, which impact could be material. our business is vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate and dependent on the timing and funding of new awards. we provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; food and consumer products; and mining and minerals). these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending. during economic slowdowns, many of our clients may face considerable budget shortfalls or may delay capital spending, which may decrease the overall demand for our services. for example, a decrease in state tax revenue as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. our clients may also find it more difficult to raise capital in the future due to substantial limitations on the availability of credit and other uncertainties in the municipal and general credit markets. in addition, our clients may also demand better pricing terms and their ability to pay our invoices in a timely manner may be affected by an increasingly weakened economy. our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. if the economy weakens further or government spending is reduced, then our revenues, net income and overall financial condition may deteriorate. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customer investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. some of our customers produce commodity products such as fertilizers, oil and gas, or copper. fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on our customers profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. commodity prices also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress. as a result of either or both of these factors, our customers may defer new investment or cancel or delay existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways. 20 table of contents contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 16.8% of our total revenue in fiscal 2008), the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and dod security regulations. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping, and accounting. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings, and so-called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price and guaranteed maximum price contracts. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. for fiscal 2008, approximately 14.2% of our revenues were earned under contracts that were either fixed-price or guaranteed maximum price in nature. for such contracts, we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. under fixed-price and guaranteed maximum-price contracts, contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of raw materials or our vendors or subcontractors inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 21 table of contents the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins. at september 30, 2008, our backlog totaled approximately $16.7 billion. projects can remain in backlog for an extended time. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination or suspension at the discretion of the client. in addition, the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide-spread economic slowdowns. accordingly, there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in addition, the gross margins (i.e., contract revenue less direct costs of contracts) we realize can vary considerably between contracts. one aspect of our business that can have a significant effect on gross margins is the amount of pass-through costs incurred. when we are directly responsible for engineering, design, procurement, and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client plant or facility, we reflect the costs of materials, equipment, and subcontracts in both revenues and costs. on other projects, where the client elects to pay for such items directly, and we have no associated responsibility for such items, these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs. since pass-through costs typically do not bring significant margins with them, it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding change in our gross margins. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is an increasing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in the industry, we participate in projects by entering into joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. our partners may also be unable to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be required to provide additional services or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could impact our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if the amount we are required to pay 22 table of contents for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could impact contract profitability. in the current economic environment, third-parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could affect our financial condition and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win fixed-price contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers. these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond, we cannot pursue that project. we have bonding capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety sole discretion. moreover, due to events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally, bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws is joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. such laws, regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could 23 table of contents negatively impact our revenue. our failure to comply with such laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which can adversely affect our business, financial condition or result of operations. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other foreign corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we regularly provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits. we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. although we have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance, if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse effect on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2006, approximately 16.8%, 16.6%, and 16.4%, respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their contracts at any time. our loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 24 table of contents we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients. the extent of such competition varies by industry, geographic market, and project type. for example, with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our larger competitors for engineering, construction, and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel; fluor; foster wheeler ltd.; urs; kbr; aker kvaerner; technip; worleyparsons; and amec. in the area of buildings, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr; hellmuth, obata &amp; kassabaum; aecom technology; and turner construction. in the area of infrastructure, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff; hntb; tetra tech; parsons; and w.s. atkins. in the area of u.s. federal programs, our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as the shaw group; saic; ch2m hill; weston solutions; lockheed martin corporation; and computer sciences corporation. and in the area of pulp and paper, our principal competitors include kbr and amec. in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors, our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2008, approximately 37.8% of our revenues was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. at a minimum, our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. in addition, our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions in foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade restrictions; embargoes; acts of war and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; tax increases; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and u.s. government policies. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. 25 table of contents in addition, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders. although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies present a number of risks, including: difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a combined, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting management attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition; difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. in addition, the current credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. accordingly, we filed a shelf registration statement on form s-4 on december 17, 2007. if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders individual ownership percentages in the company. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors, including: fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; 26 table of contents the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; natural disasters or other crises, such as the hurricanes affecting oil-producing regions like the gulf of mexico; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. fluctuations in quarterly results could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock. our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectibility of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; the amount of reserves necessary for self-insured risks; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions; provisions for income taxes and realizability of deferred tax assets; and the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs. an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. under the u.s. financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no. 142 goodwill and other intangible assets (sfas 142), we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach, rather than amortizing it over time. as of september 30, 2008, we had $924.1 million of goodwill, representing 21.6% of our total assets of $4.3 billion. we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant 27 table of contents sustained decline in a reporting unit market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their book value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142, we may apply various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. the application of these valuation methods can be influenced by such factors as industry performance, changes in technology and operating cash flows. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which the charge is taken. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximum-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 85.8% during fiscal 2008), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares. these types of provisions, as well as our shareholder rights agreement, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 44 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk our only committed source for long-term credit is a $290.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility. the total amount outstanding under this facility at september 30, 2008 was $55.7 million. this agreement expires in may 2012, and provides for both fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings. our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to lower our overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we continuously monitor changes in interest rates, and use cash provided from operations to re-pay our borrowings as quickly as possible. furthermore, the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. 44 table of contents foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of sfas 133 in accounting for our derivative contracts. at september 30, 2008, we had a euro put option outstanding with a notional amount of 7.5 million with an average exchange rate of 1.4461 eur-to-gbp. this derivative contract expires in october of 2009. we ve determined this contract to be highly effective according to the provisions of sfas 133. the contract is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. at september 30, 2008, we had a euro forward contract outstanding with a notional amount of 6.2 million with an average exchange rate of 1.2599 eur-to-gbp. this derivative contract expires in april of 2009. we ve determined this contract to be highly effective according to the provisions of sfas 133. the contract is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. concurrent with the fiscal 2004 acquisition of the babtie group limited, we entered into a forward contract with a large u.s. bank. the purpose of the contract is to hedge the company exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on a &pound;39.9 million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries. based on the terms of the contract, we believe the effect of the loan on future earnings at september 30, 2008 should be limited to $2.0 million of expense, of which $0.7 million will be recognized in the next 12 months. we recorded $0.7 million of expense during fiscal 2008. at september 30, 2008, the notional amount of the contract was &pound;39.9 million. it provides for an average exchange rate of 0.5828 gbp-to-usd, and expires in june of 2011. we have determined that this derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the provisions of sfas 133. the fair value of derivative contracts included in other deferred liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets totaled $3.0 million and $8.6 million at september 30, 2008 and september 30, 2007, respectively.risk factors 18 risk factors construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities. construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. on many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental ( hse ) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. as a result, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. negative conditions in the credit and financial markets could impair our ability to operate our business, implement our acquisition strategy, and access our cash and short-term investments. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. in addition, some of our clients depend of the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects. due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the u.s. and abroad, the availability of credit has continued to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain in spite of government efforts to increase liquidity and hold or reduce interest rates. this situation could negatively impact our clients ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers, and 18 table of contents subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a diminution in our clients access to the credit markets. if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that this may occur in the future. if this were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations. our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns. we provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; food and consumer products; and mining and minerals). these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. current global economic conditions have negatively impacted our clients ability and willingness to fund their projects. they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms, and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, the precipitous increase in crude oil prices followed by their collapse in calendar year 2008 caused several of our clients operating in the upstream oil and gas market to re-examine a number of their large capital projects, which resulted in delays and cancellations of contracts previously awarded to us. in the public sector, declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. these conditions have reduced the demand for our services, which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations. current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent 19 table of contents on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customer investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. to the extent our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. in addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur cost resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. 20 table of contents we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business. most litigation with which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers compensation, personal injury, environmental, employment/labor, professional liability, and similar matters. we can be exposed to claims and litigation if, for example, there is a failure at any of the projects for which we have provided engineering or other services. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards and those standards are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. our insurers are also subject to business risk and, as a result, one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 20.3% of our total revenue in fiscal 2009), the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and dod security regulations. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping, and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings, and so-called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. 21 table of contents if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price and guaranteed maximum price contracts. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. for fiscal 2009, approximately 15% of our revenues were earned under contracts that were either fixed-price or guaranteed maximum price in nature. for these contracts, we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. under fixed-price and guaranteed maximum-price contracts, contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of raw materials, or our vendors or subcontractors inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins. as of the end of fiscal 2009, our backlog totaled approximately $15.2 billion. there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client. in addition, the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide-spread economic slowdowns. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in the industry, we participate in projects by entering into joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the 22 table of contents required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages, provide additional services, or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. under agreements with joint and several liabilities, we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. in addition, these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could impact contract profitability. in the current economic environment, third-parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win fixed-price contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers. these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety sole discretion. in addition, because of the overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among 23 table of contents other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws is joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers, and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. such laws, regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. our failure to comply with such laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state, and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and result of operations. our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders. although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and therefore, our ability to do business. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other foreign corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we regularly provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, 24 table of contents our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, and fiscal 2007, approximately 20.3%, 16.8%, and 16.6%, respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay, or cancel their contracts at any time. our loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients. the extent of such competition varies by industry, geographic market, and project type. for example, with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our larger competitors for engineering, construction, and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel; fluor; foster wheeler; kbr; aker kvaerner; technip; worleyparsons; the shaw group; and amec. in the area of buildings, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr; hok; aecom; and turner. in the area of infrastructure, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs; parsons brinckerhoff; hntb; tetra tech; parsons; and w.s. atkins. in the area of national government programs, our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as saic; ch2m hill; weston; lockheed martin; and computer sciences corporation. in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors, our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2009, approximately 35.8% of our revenues was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations 25 table of contents to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. at a minimum, our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. in addition, our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions in foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; embargoes; acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; expropriation of property; tax increases; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and u.s. government policies. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies presents a number of risks, including: difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a combined, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting management attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition; difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business. 26 table of contents in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. the current credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. accordingly, we filed a shelf registration statement on form s-4 on december 7, 2007. if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders individual ownership percentages in the company. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock because of a number of factors, including: fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; natural disasters or other crises, such as the hurricanes affecting oil-producing regions like the gulf of mexico; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectibility of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; the amount of reserves necessary for self-insured risks; 27 table of contents accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions; valuation of stock-based compensation; and the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs. our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. under accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach, rather than amortizing it over time. as of october 2, 2009, we had $929.8 million of goodwill, representing 21.0% of our total assets of $4.4 billion. we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximum-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 85% during fiscal 2009), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares. 28 table of contents these types of provisions, as well as our shareholder rights agreement, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 45 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk our only committed source for long-term credit is a $290.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility. the total amount outstanding under this facility at october 2, 2009 was $0.7 million. this agreement expires in may 2012, and provides for both fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings. our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to lower our overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we continuously monitor changes in interest rates, and use cash provided from operations to re-pay our borrowings as quickly as possible. furthermore, the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. 45 table of contents foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of asc 815-10 in accounting for our derivative contracts. the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.risk factors 19 risk factors construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities. construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. on many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental ( hse ) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. as a result, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. negative conditions in the credit and financial markets could impair our ability to operate our business, implement our acquisition strategy, and access our cash and short-term investments. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. in addition, some of our clients depend of the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects. due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the u.s. and abroad, the availability of credit has continued to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain in spite of government efforts to increase liquidity and hold or reduce interest rates. this situation could negatively impact our clients ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays 19 table of contents and failures due to, among other reasons, a diminution in our clients access to the credit markets. if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that this may occur in the future. if this were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations. our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns. we provide technical, professional, construction, and o&amp;m services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; food and consumer products; and mining and minerals). these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. current global economic conditions have negatively impacted our clients ability and willingness to fund their projects. they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms, and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, the precipitous increase in crude oil prices followed by their collapse in calendar year 2008 caused several of our clients operating in the upstream oil and gas market to re-examine a number of their large capital projects, which resulted in delays and cancellations of contracts previously awarded to us. in the public sector, declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. these conditions have reduced the demand for our services, which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations. current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customer investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect 20 table of contents on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. to the extent our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. in addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur cost resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business. most litigation with which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers compensation, personal injury, environmental, employment/labor, professional liability, and similar matters. we can be exposed to claims and litigation if, for example, there is a failure at any of the projects for which we have provided engineering or other services. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards and those standards are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. 21 table of contents we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. our insurers are also subject to business risk and, as a result, one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 25.4% of our total revenue in fiscal 2010), the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and dod security regulations. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping, and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings, and so-called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 22 table of contents we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price and guaranteed maximum price contracts. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. for fiscal 2010, approximately 14% of our revenues were earned under contracts that were either fixed-price or guaranteed maximum price in nature. for these contracts, we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. under fixed-price and guaranteed maximum-price contracts, contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of raw materials, or our vendors or subcontractors inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins. as of the end of fiscal 2010, our backlog totaled approximately $13.2 billion. there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client. in addition, the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide-spread economic slowdowns. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in the industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages, provide additional services, or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. under agreements with joint and several liabilities, we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. 23 table of contents in addition, we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. in addition, these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could impact contract profitability. in the current economic environment, third-parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win fixed-price contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers. these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety sole discretion. in addition, because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or 24 table of contents previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws is joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers, and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. such laws, regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. our failure to comply with such laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state, and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and result of operations. our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders. although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and therefore, our ability to do business. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other foreign corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we regularly provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 25 table of contents we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008, approximately 25.4%, 20.3%, and 16.8%, respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay, or cancel their contracts at any time. our loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients. the extent of such competition varies by industry, geographic market, and project type. for example, with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our larger competitors for engineering, construction, and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel, fluor, foster wheeler, kbr, aker kvaerner, technip, worleyparsons, the shaw group, and amec. in the area of buildings, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr, hok, aecom, and turner. in the area of infrastructure, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs, parsons brinckerhoff, hntb, tetra tech, parsons, and w.s. atkins. in the area of national government programs, our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as saic, ch2m hill, weston, lockheed martin, and computer sciences corporation. in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors, our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2010, approximately 30% of our revenues was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. at a minimum, our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. in addition, our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions in foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; 26 table of contents difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; embargoes; acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; expropriation of property; tax increases; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and u.s. government policies. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies presents a number of risks, including: difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a combined, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting management attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition; difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. the current credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. 27 table of contents in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. accordingly, we filed a shelf registration statement on form s-4 on december 7, 2007. if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders individual ownership percentages in the company. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock because of a number of factors, including: fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; natural disasters or other crises, such as the hurricanes affecting oil-producing regions like the gulf of mexico; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectibility of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; the amount of reserves necessary for self-insured risks; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions; valuation of stock-based compensation; and the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs. 28 table of contents our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. under accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach, rather than amortizing it over time. as of october 1, 2010, we had $1.1 billion of goodwill, representing 23.9% of our total assets of $4.7 billion. we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximum-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 86% during fiscal 2010), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares. these types of provisions, as well as our shareholder rights agreement, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. 29 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk our only committed source for long-term credit is a $290.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility. there were no direct borrowings outstanding under this facility at october 1, 2010. this agreement expires in 47 table of contents may 2012, and provides for both fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings. our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to lower our overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we continuously monitor changes in interest rates, and use cash provided from operations to re-pay our borrowings as quickly as possible. furthermore, the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of asc 815-10 in accounting for our derivative contracts. the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.risk factors 17 risk factors we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. if any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities. construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. on many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental ( hse ) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. as a result, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. negative conditions in the credit and financial markets could impair our ability to operate our business, implement our acquisition strategy, and access our cash and short-term investments; it could also adversely affect our customers businesses. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. in addition, some of our clients depend of the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects. due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the u.s. and abroad, the availability of credit has continued to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain in spite of government efforts to stabilize the credit markets. this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness (much of which is scheduled to expire in the third quarter of fiscal 2012), enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us. in addition, these market conditions could negatively impact our clients ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of page 17 table of contents services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a diminution in our clients access to the credit markets. if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, south america, and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that this may occur in the future. if this were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations. our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns. we provide technical, professional, construction, and o&amp;m services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; mining and minerals; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; and food and consumer products). these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. current global economic conditions have negatively impacted our clients ability and willingness to fund their projects. they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms, and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, in the public sector, declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. in addition, due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. these conditions have reduced the demand for our services, which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations. current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. to the extent our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. page 18 table of contents our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. in addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur cost resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business. most litigation with which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers compensation, personal injury, environmental, employment/labor, professional liability, and similar matters. we can be exposed to claims and litigation if, for example, there is a failure at any of the projects for which we have provided engineering or other services. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. our insurers are also subject to business risk and, as a result, one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as cost controls. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. in addition, the u.s. federal government has announced its intention to scale back outsourcing of services in favor of insourcing jobs to its employees. this practice and its adoption by other government entities could reduce the size and scope of contracts awarded to us. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (for example, those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately page 19 table of contents 24.4% of our total revenue in fiscal 2011), a significant reduction in government funding (e.g., as a result of the efforts of the u.s. congress joint select committee on deficit reduction) or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and dod security regulations. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping, and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings, and so-called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price and guaranteed maximum price contracts. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. for fiscal 2011, approximately 19% of our revenues were earned under contracts that were either fixed-price or guaranteed maximum price in nature. for these contracts, we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. under fixed-price and guaranteed maximum-price contracts, contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of raw materials, or our vendors or subcontractors inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins. as of the end of fiscal 2011, our backlog totaled approximately $14.3 billion. there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client. in addition, the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide-spread economic slowdowns. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. page 20 table of contents our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in the industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages, provide additional services, or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. under agreements with joint and several liabilities, we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. in addition, these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability. in the current economic environment, third-parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win fixed-price contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers. these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety sole discretion. in addition, because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws is joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various page 21 table of contents properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers, and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. such laws, regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. our failure to comply with such laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state, and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and result of operations. our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders. although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and therefore, our ability to do business. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), the u.k. bribery act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2011, 2010, and fiscal 2009, approximately 24.4%, 25.4%, and 20.3%, respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay, or cancel their page 22 table of contents contracts at any time. our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients. the extent of such competition varies by industry, geographic market, and project type. for example, with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our larger competitors for engineering, construction, and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel, fluor, foster wheeler, kbr, technip, worleyparsons, the shaw group, and amec. in the area of buildings, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr, hok, aecom, and turner. in the area of infrastructure, our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs, parsons brinckerhoff, hntb, tetra tech, parsons, and w.s. atkins. in the area of national government programs, our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as saic, ch2m hill, weston, lockheed martin, and computer sciences corporation. in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors, our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2011, approximately 38% of our revenues was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. at a minimum, our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. in addition, our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; embargoes; acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; expropriation of property; tax increases; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and u.s. government policies. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. page 23 table of contents our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies presents a number of risks, including: difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting management attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition; difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities; and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. the current credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. accordingly, we filed a shelf registration statement on form s-4 on december 7, 2007. if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders individual ownership percentages in the company. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock, because of a number of factors, including: fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; changes in prices of commodities or other supplies; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; natural disasters or other crises, such as the hurricanes affecting oil-producing regions like the gulf of mexico; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. page 24 table of contents our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under u.s. gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; the amount of reserves necessary for self-insured risks; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions; valuation of stock-based compensation; and the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs. our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. under u.s. gaap, we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach. as of september 30, 2011, we had $1.7 billion of goodwill, representing 28.9% of our total assets of $6.0 billion. we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximum-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 81% during fiscal 2011), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. for example, there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients. legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels. such changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. however, these changes could also increase the pace projects, such as carbon capture or storage page 25 table of contents projects, that could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate. we rely heavily on computer, information, and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. from time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption, or release of data. in addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic security breaches, or similar events or disruptions. any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property, and results of operations, as well as those of our clients. we are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages. we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services. for example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares. these types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk our primary source for credit is a $290.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. the total amount utilized under this facility at september 30, 2011 was $200.5 million ($171.8 million in the form of direct borrowings and $28.7 million utilized in the form of letters of credit). this agreement expires in may 2012, and provides for both fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings. our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to lower our overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we continuously monitor changes in interest rates, and use cash provided from operations to re-pay our borrowings as quickly as possible. furthermore, the company can generally use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of asc 815-10 in accounting for our derivative contracts. the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. page 41 table of contentsrisk factors page 16 r isk factors we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. if any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials, in a challenging environment, and often in geographically remote locations. on many sites, we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured, disabled or even lose their lives, the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed, and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and/or criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental ( hse ) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. in addition, despite the work of our functional groups, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work, equipment or supplies. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. accordingly, if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards, we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns and times of political uncertainty. we provide technical, professional, construction, and o&amp;m services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; mining and minerals; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; power; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; and food and consumer products). these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty. current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients' ability and willingness to fund their projects, including their ability to raise capital and pay, or timely pay, our invoices. they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms, and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, in the public sector, declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. in addition, due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. these conditions have reduced, and may continue to reduce, the demand for our services, which has had, and may continue to have, a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. current economic and political conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. for example, following the recent u.s. elections, many observers page 16 expect spending on u.s. infrastructure to increase significantly. there is no assurance that such spendin g will occur or that the company will benefit from any increase in spending. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients' markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged re coveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions, a failure to obtain expected benefits from any increased infrastructure spending, or a redu ction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients' markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers' investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. furthermore, declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices, such as the middle east. to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services. if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards, we could be exposed to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations. our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability, and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage, and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. further, even where coverage applies, the policies have deductibles, which result in our assumption of exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any claim filed by us. in addition, clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. an uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients. the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional, national, and multinational companies. the extent of our competition varies by industry, geographic market, and project type. for example, with respect to our construction, and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. the extent and type of competition varies by market and geographic area. page 17 our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process, which is standard in our industry. we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing, schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services. competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us, th ereby increasing the risk that, among other things, we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we've seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past. if we are unable to compete effecti vely, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts. our revenues are derived from new contract awards. delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such prospects as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our long-term projected results. it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive large-scale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, governmental and environmental approvals. since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. furthermore, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and as a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project. in addition, many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer. as a result, we may incur significant costs for engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer. the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. in some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business. since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients' projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. in addition, while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying exclusions for matters such as fraud, coverage limits and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. for example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, coverage that is more limited, or increased premium costs or deductibles. we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. if any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our page 18 coverage or otherwise cann ot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted. in addition, the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors for, among other things, additional costs exceeding the original contract price. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. further, these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations, arbitration or litigation proceedings, which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims. a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the nature of our contracts, particularly those that are fixed-price, subject us to risks of cost overruns. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates. for fiscal 2016, approximately 18% of our revenues were earned under fixed-price contracts. such contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance. in addition, we may enter into guaranteed maximum price contracts where we guarantee a price or delivery date. for fixed-price contracts, we may benefit from any cost-savings, but we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. fixed-price contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather or other delays beyond our control, changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials, our vendors' or subcontractors' inability or failure to perform, or changes in general economic conditions, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. these risks are exacerbated for projects with long-term durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted. like fixed-price contracts, the expected cost of cost-reimbursable projects are based in part on our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts. if we are unable to properly support the costs we incur or otherwise fail to obtain proper reimbursement for all costs incurred - for whatever reason - the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses. additionally, we may be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals at a reasonable cost who have the required experience and expertise. the market for these and other personnel is competitive. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise, and in the timeframe, demanded by our clients, or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. furthermore, some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects. if we were to lose some or all of these personnel, they would be difficult to replace. loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects. page 19 in addition, in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans, which requires devoting time and resour ces toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our bu siness, financial condition, and results of operations. the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins. backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. as of the end of fiscal 2016, our backlog totaled approximately $18.8 billion. there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client. in the event of a project cancellation, we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices. the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies, which are a significant source of our revenue and profit, are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. legislatures typically appropriate funds on a year-by-year basis, while contract performance may take more than one year. as a result, contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated, and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts. our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (for example, those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 21.4% of our total revenue in fiscal 2016 ), a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. the u.s. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage page 20 in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract. this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. moreover, we ma y not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our bus iness and results of operations. in addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies such as the u.s. defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. for example, in so-called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted. many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts. to the extent this occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in our industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including the nonperformance, default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners. our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages, provide additional services, or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. under agreements with joint and several liabilities, we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners. differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues, which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures. in addition, in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement. if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights, we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities. we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. page 21 the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our bus iness, financial condition, and results of operations. we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. third-party subcontractors we hire perform much of the work performed under our contracts. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability. there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed, customer concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract. in addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. in the current economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party's ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems, adversely affecting our cost of borrowing and our business. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. instability in the credit markets in the u.s. or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us. we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit, which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business. in addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients' ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. some of our customers, suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations. disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients' ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients. in addition, clients may be unable to fund new projects, may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them. our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice. in addition, any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could page 22 increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules. these disruptions could materially impact our back log and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, our clients' unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital. if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, south america, australia and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that such events may occur in the future. if any such events were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash, which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers. these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety's sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the company's credit-worthiness. because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. in addition, future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. past and future environmental, heath, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities. we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws is joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers, and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered or only partially covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. health safety, and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could page 23 negatively impact our revenue. changes in the environmental laws and regulations, remediation obligations, enforcement actions, stricter interpretations of existing requiremen ts, future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. if we fail to comply with any environmental, health, or safety laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, we could be exposed to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and res ults of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state, and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and result of operations. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders. although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in u.s. government contracts, and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, regulations pertaining to export control, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, cancellation of contracts, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), the u.k. bribery act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances; strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have a material adverse impact on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, approximately page 24 21.4%, 21.7%, and 17.8%, res pectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay, or cancel their contrac ts at any time. our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2016, approximately 43.0% of our revenue was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; potential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, export control and anti-boycott laws and similar non-u.s. laws and regulations; lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country; renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; embargoes; changes in labor conditions; acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; expropriation of property; tax increases; currency exchanges rate fluctuations; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and u.s. government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate, including embargoes or other trade restrictions. the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. in addition, military action or continued unrest, particularly in the middle east, could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. we work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost. some of our services are performed in high-risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. in those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors. acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our page 25 operations, including disruptions resul ting from the evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts, or the loss of key employees, contractors or assets. foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects. our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. these actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency. based on fluctuations in currency, the u.s. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries. our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom's proposed exit from the european union. in june 2016, the u.k. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the e.u., commonly referred to as brexit. as a result of the referendum, there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the u.k. and e.u. countries and increased regulatory complexities. these changes may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers, employees, and subcontractors, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. brexit may also create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs, terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts, decrease or postpone currently planned contracts, or negotiate for more favorable deal terms, each of which may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies presents a number of risks, including: assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting management's attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or post-acquisition deterioration in an acquired business; difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; difficulties retaining key personnel of an acquired business; increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities; difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business; page 26 increased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls; and the potential requirement for additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available, or if available, may not have favorable terms. while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds, and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity. if our management is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy, our operating results could be harmed. in addition, even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. moreover, we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions. future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms, or at all. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. if we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders' individual ownership percentages in the company. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. fluctuations are caused by a number of factors, including: fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; changes in prices of commodities or other supplies; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; the decision by the board of directors to begin or cease paying a dividend, and the expectation that if the company pays dividends, it would declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future; natural disasters or other crises; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. page 27 our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under u.s. gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; estimates of other liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves and reserves necessary for self-insured risks; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions; valuation of stock-based compensation; the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and income tax provisions and related valuation allowances. our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we may be adversely impacted by, or unable to fully realize the benefits of, our corporate reorganization. in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we reorganized the company's operating units into four lines of business, each of which is a separate reportable segment. we may be unable to realize the anticipated longer term efficiency benefits of the reorganization. furthermore, our reorganization into four reportable segments, which also represent the company's reporting units, may have a material impact on the risk that an impairment charge of goodwill will occur. in the past, with a single reportable segment the company had two reporting units. following the reorganization, our number of reporting units has increased to four reporting units. our goodwill was allocated amongst the new reporting units, for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, on the basis of enterprise fair values. this allocation of goodwill to the four new reporting units could make it more likely that the company will have an impairment charge in the future, in circumstances where an impairment charge may not have been necessary prior to the reorganization. an impairment charge to one of our reporting units could have an impact on our results of operations. an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. under u.s. gaap, we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach. as of september 30, 2016, we had $3.1 billion of goodwill, representing 41.8% of our total assets of $7.4 billion. we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors. if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the page 28 amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our fi nancial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below . we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage. we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. for example, as of september 30, 2016 and october 2, 2015, our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $403.1 million and $413.1 million, respectively. see note 6 pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional disclosure. in the future, our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan asset performance and other factors. if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 82% during fiscal 2016), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. for example, there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients. legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. however, these changes could also increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, that could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm. we rely heavily on computer, information, and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. from time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other page 29 steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption, or release of data. in addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommuni cations failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, malicious code, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, or similar events or disruptions. any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property, and results of operations, as well as those of our clien ts. in addition, we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions, including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients' proprietary or classified information. we rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain all confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems, but they may still be vulnerable to these threats. as a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. and, our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have an adverse effect on our business. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients. our technology and intellectual property provide us, in certain instances, with a competitive advantage. although we protect our property through patent registrations, license restrictions, and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the u.s. if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business. in addition, if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control. extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate. as an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. if we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects page 30 are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a negative impact on our operations. in addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our cli ents which may reduce our profits. we are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages. we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services. for example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages. in addition, our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards, licensing requirements, securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed. we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties. these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares. these types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk page 51 quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk. in the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. interest rate risk please refer to the discussion of the 2014 facility and the 2012 facility in the liquidity and capital resources discussion in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form 10-k, and note 5 - borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k. foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. we follow the provisions of asc 815-10 - derivatives and hedging in accounting for our derivative contracts. the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.risk factors page 15 r isk factors we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. if any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we, the owner, or others working at the project site fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials, in a challenging environment, and often in geographically remote locations. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, or if others working at the site fail to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures, our employees and others may become injured, disabled or even lose their lives, the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed, and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating and insurance costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and/or criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental ( hse ) work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. in addition, despite the work of our functional groups, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work, equipment or supplies. our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. accordingly, if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards, we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the sectors and industries in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns and times of political uncertainty. we provide technical, professional, construction, and o&amp;m services to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries, including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; mining and minerals; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; power; and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; and food and consumer products). these sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty. current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients' ability and willingness to fund their projects, including their ability to raise capital and pay, or timely pay, our invoices. they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms, and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, in the public sector, declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. in addition, due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. these conditions have reduced, and may continue to reduce, the demand for our services, which has had, and may continue to have, a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. page 15 current economic and political conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economi c recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients' markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. a continuation or worsening of current wea k economic conditions, a failure to obtain expected benefits from any increased infrastructure spending, or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. furthermore , if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry, our business may be disproportionately affected by negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries. regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients' markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers' investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. furthermore, declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices, such as the middle east. to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services. if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards or contractual requirements, we could be exposed to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations. our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability, and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage, and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. further, even where coverage applies, the policies have deductibles, which result in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us. in addition, clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. an uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients. the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional, national, and multinational companies. the extent of our competition varies by industry, geographic area, and project type. for example, with respect to our construction, and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may page 16 give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. the extent and t ype of competition varies by market and geographic area. our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process, which is standard in our industry. we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing, schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services. competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us, thereby increasing the risk that, among other things, we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we've seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts. our revenues are derived from new contract awards. delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such prospects as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our long-term projected results. it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive large-scale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals. since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. furthermore, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and, as a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project. in addition, many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer. as a result, we may incur significant costs for engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer. the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. in some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business. since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients' projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. in addition, while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying coverage limits as well as exclusions for matters such as fraud, and insurance companies may attempt to deny claims for which we seek coverage. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, retentions and limits under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. for example, page 17 catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, coverage that is more limited, or increased premium costs or higher deductibles. we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, an d this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. if any of our third party insurers fail, abruptl y cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted. in addition, the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors for, among other things, additional costs exceeding the original contract price. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. further, these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations, arbitration or litigation proceedings, which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims. a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the nature of our contracts, particularly those that are fixed-price, subject us to risks of cost overruns. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or if the project experiences schedule delays. for fiscal 2017, approximately 19% of our revenues were earned under fixed-price contracts. both fixed-price and many cost reimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance. for fixed-price contracts, we may benefit from any cost-savings, but we bear greater risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. fixed-price contracts are established in part on partial or incomplete designs, cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, commodity and other materials pricing and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if the design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather or other delays beyond our control, changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials, our vendors' or subcontractors' inability or failure to perform, or changes in general economic conditions, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. these risks are exacerbated for projects with long-term durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted. like fixed-price contracts, the expected cost of cost-reimbursable projects are based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts. a portion of the fee is often linked to the final cost and schedule objectives and if for whatever reason, the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses. our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel. the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost. the market for these and other personnel is competitive. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise, and in the timeframe, demanded by our clients, or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. furthermore, some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects. if we were to page 18 lose some or all of these personnel, they would be difficult to replace. loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects. in addition, in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans, which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins. backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. as of the end of fiscal 2017, our backlog totaled approximately $19.8 billion. there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client. in the event of a project cancellation, we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices. the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability. in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance. contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies, which are a significant source of our revenue and profit, are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. legislatures typically appropriate funds on a year-by-year basis, while contract performance may take more than one year. as a result, contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated, and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts. our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (for example, those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 19.2% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017), a page 19 significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and resul ts of operations. most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. the u.s. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract. this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. moreover, we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. in addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies such as the u.s. defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies. if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. for example, in so-called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted. many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts. to the extent this occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. as is common in our industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. further, we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners, including with respect to nonperformance, default, bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance. our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners. differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues, which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures. in addition, in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement. if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights, we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities. page 20 we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the contro lling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. third-party subcontractors we hire perform much of the work performed under our contracts. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability. there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed, customer concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract. in addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. in the current economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party's ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems, adversely affecting our cost of borrowing and our business. although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. instability in the credit markets in the u.s. or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit, which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business. in addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients' ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. page 21 some of our customers, suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations. disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients' ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients. in addition, clients may be unable to fund new projects , may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them. our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing project or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice. in addition, any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules. these disruptions could materially impact our backlog and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices after we have already committed resources to their projects. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, our clients' unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital. if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, south america, australia and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that such events may occur in the future. if any such events were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash, which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts. in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers. these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety's sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the company's credit-worthiness. because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. in addition, future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. past and future environmental, heath, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities. we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. various u.s. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws is joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. page 22 when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employ ees, customers, and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered or only partially covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. health safety, and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. changes in the environmental laws and regulations, remediation obligations, enforcement actions, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. if we fail to comply with any environmental, health, or safety laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, we could be exposed to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state, and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and result of operations. if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires full compliance with both export regulatory laws and international trafficking in arms regulations ( itar ). although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in u.s. government contracts, and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business. employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, regulations pertaining to export control, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, cancellation of contracts, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ), the u.k. bribery act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances; strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict page 23 with local custom and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have a material adverse impact on us. a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, approximately 19.2%, 21.4% and 21.7%, respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay, or cancel their contracts at any time. our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. for fiscal 2017, approximately 42% of our revenue was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges; unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; potential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, export control and anti-boycott laws and similar non-u.s. laws and regulations; lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country; renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; embargoes or other trade restrictions, including sanctions; changes in labor conditions; acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; social, political, and economic instability; expropriation of property; tax increases; currency exchanges rate fluctuations; limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and u.s. government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate. the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. in addition, military action or continued unrest, particularly in the middle east, could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and increase our security costs. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. page 24 we work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost. some of our services are performed in high-risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. in those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors. acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts, or the loss of key employees, contractors or assets. foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects. our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. these actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency. based on fluctuations in currency, the u.s. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries. our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom's proposed exit from the european union. in june 2016, the u.k. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the e.u., commonly referred to as brexit. as a result of the u.k.'s exit from the e.u., there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the u.k. and e.u. countries and increased regulatory complexities. these changes may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers, employees, and subcontractors, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the ongoing negotiations between the u.k. and the e.u. as to the terms upon which the u.k. will exit from the e.u. and the uncertainty as to their future trade agreement continues to create economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs, terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts, decrease or postpone currently planned contracts, or negotiate for more favorable deal terms, each of which may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties. our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies presents a number of risks, including: assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated; valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business; failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business; the effects of diverting management ' attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies; potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations; potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or post-acquisition deterioration in an acquired business; page 25 difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; difficulties retaining key personnel of an acquired business; increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities; difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business; increased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls; and the potential requirement for additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available, or if available, may not have favorable terms. while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds, and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity. if our management is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy, our operating results could be harmed. in addition, even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. moreover, we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability. in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions. future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms, or at all. acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. if we issue additional equity securities, as is contemplated, for example, in connection with the merger, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders' individual ownership percentages in the company. there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock. our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid, and intend to continue paying, a regular quarterly dividend. the declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price. our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. fluctuations are caused by a number of factors, including: fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; page 26 unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; delays incurred in connection with a project; changes in prices of commodities or other supplies; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; weather conditions that delay work at project sites; the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; the decision by the board of directors to begin or cease paying a dividend, and the expectation that if the company pays dividends, it would declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future; natural disasters or other crises; staff levels and utilization rates; changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and general economic and political conditions. our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under u.s. gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; estimates of other liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves and reserves necessary for self-insured risks; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions; valuation of stock-based compensation; the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and income tax provisions and related valuation allowances. our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. an impairment charge on our goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. under u.s. gaap, we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach. as of september 29, 2017, we had $3.0 billion of goodwill, representing 40.8% of our total assets of $7.4 billion. we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained page 27 decline in a reporting unit's market value, legal factors, operating perfo rmance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors. if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below. we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage. we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. for example, as of september 29, 2017 and september 30, 2016, our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $252.0 million and $403.1 million, respectively. see note 7- pension plans and other postretirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional disclosure. in the future, our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan asset performance and other factors. if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 81% during fiscal 2017), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients and have other impacts on our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. however, these changes could also increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, that could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, or an ultimate determination that the company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. page 28 systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm. we rely heavily on computer, information, and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. from time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption, or release of data. in addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommunications failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, malicious code, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, or similar events or disruptions. any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property, and results of operations, as well as those of our clients. in addition, we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions, including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients' proprietary or classified information. as part of our ongoing effort to utilize industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain all confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems, we have observed increased threat activity to our computer systems, and have identified instances of unauthorized access to certain of our computer systems occurring in the 2014-2016 timeframe. in response, we are conducting an ongoing internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel and technical experts to identify and remediate the source and impact of these incursions, as well as comply with related notification and disclosure obligations. expenses incurred to date related to this matter have not been material. we will incur additional expenses and may incur losses in connection with this matter, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows; however, at this time we are unable to reasonably estimate any such additional expenses or losses. while we have security measures and technology in place to protect our and our clients' proprietary or classified information, if these measures fail as a result of a cyber-attack, other third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and someone obtains unauthorized access to our or our clients' information, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. as a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. and, our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have an adverse effect on our business. we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients. our technology and intellectual property provide us, in certain instances, with a competitive advantage. although we protect our property through patent registrations, license restrictions, and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the u.s. if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business. page 29 we also hold licenses from third partie which may be utilized in our business operations. if we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control. extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate. as an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. if we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a negative impact on our operations. in addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits. we are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages. we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services. for example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages. in addition, our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards, licensing requirements, securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed. we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties. these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties. delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example: only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board; there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares. these types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. page 30 fail ure of the merger to be consummated, the termination of the merger agreement or a significant delay in the consummation of the merger could negatively affect our stock price and our future business and financial results. our obligations and ch2m's obligations to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including, but not limited to: (i) the approval of the merger agreement by the ch2m stockholders, (ii) the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under, or receipt of the applicable consents required under, the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended and certain foreign antitrust and competition laws, each of which have been satisfied or obtained, (iii) the absence of any order, applicable law or other legal restraints of certain specified governmental authorities enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger, (iv) the accuracy of certain representations and warranties of each of the parties contained in the merger agreement, subject to specified materiality qualifications, (v) compliance, in all material respects, by each of the parties with their respective covenants contained in the merger agreement, (vi) the effectiveness of the registration statement on form s-4 filed by the company for the issuance of the company common stock in the merger, which was satisfied on november 9, 2017, and the approval of the listing of such shares on the new york stock exchange, (vii) the absence of a material adverse effect on either ch2m or the company since the date of the merger agreement and (viii) the other conditions set forth in the merger agreement. there can be no assurance that these conditions to the consummation of the merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. in addition, other factors such as jacobs' ability to obtain the debt financing it needs to consummate the merger, or legal proceedings related to the merger, may affect when and whether the merger will occur. if the merger is not consummated or is delayed, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be consummated or will be consummated on a particular timeframe. in addition, we and our subsidiaries may experience negative reactions from our respective clients, regulators, vendors and employees. furthermore, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. if the merger is not consummated, we will have paid these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the transaction. any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with a failure or delay in consummating the merger, including the diversion of management attention or loss of other opportunities during the pendency of the merger, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. if jacobs' financing for the merger becomes unavailable, the merger may not be completed. jacobs intends to finance the cash component of the consideration payable to ch2m stockholders in the merger, the repayment of ch2m's outstanding indebtedness and other transaction expenses with a combination of cash on hand and debt financing, which includes the jacobs term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion and additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility. jacobs currently estimates that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the merger will be approximately $1.9 billion. there are a number of conditions in the jacobs term loan credit agreement and the revolving credit facility that must be satisfied or waived in order for closing of the debt financing to occur. there is a risk that these conditions will not be satisfied. in the event that the financing contemplated by the jacobs term loan credit agreement and the revolving credit facility is not available, jacobs may obtain alternative financing to finance the consideration payable to ch2m stockholders in the merger, the repayment of ch2m's outstanding indebtedness and other transaction expenses. such alternative financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. while obtaining financing is not a condition to jacobs' obligation to effect the merger, if other financing becomes necessary and jacobs is unable to secure such other financing, the merger may not be completed. the merger may adversely affect the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation. if the merger is completed, it may give rise to unexpected liabilities and costs, including costs associated with the defense and resolution of possible litigation or other claims, and may have an adverse effect on any pending claims against jacobs or ch2m. jacobs could also be subject to claims or litigation related to the merger, whether or not the merger is consummated. such actions may create additional uncertainty relating to the merger, and responding to such claims and defending such actions may be costly and distracting to management. page 31 the current ownership and voting interests of jacobs stockholders will be diluted by the merger. upon the completion of the merger, except for stockholders who own stock in both jacobs and ch2m, each jacobs stockholder will have a percentage ownership of jacobs that is smaller than such stockholder's current percentage ownership of jacobs. because of this, jacobs stockholders will generally have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of jacobs. if the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger, jacobs stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger. the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger. the success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the combined company's ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining jacobs' and ch2m's businesses, including achieving cost savings and operating synergies. the combined company's ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend, to a large extent, on the ability of jacobs to integrate the businesses of ch2m with jacobs. the combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. as a result, the combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of jacobs and ch2m. the integration process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude or delay the realization of the full benefits expected by jacobs. the failure of the combined company to meet the challenges involved in integrating successfully the operations of jacobs and ch2m or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could seriously harm its results of operations. in addition, the overall integration of the two companies may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of client relationships and diversion of management's attention, and may cause the combined company's stock price to decline. the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination; delays, unexpected costs or difficulties in completing the integration of ch2m or its assets; unanticipated issues in integrating logistics, information, communications and other systems; unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations; unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators; diversion of the attention and resources of management or other disruptions to current operations; challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; retaining key customers and suppliers; challenges in obtaining new customers and winning customer contracts; retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; organizational conflicts of interest; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company; and potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the merger. many of these factors will be outside of jacobs' and the combined company's control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially impact jacobs' and the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, even if the operations of jacobs and ch2m are integrated successfully, the combined company may not realize the full benefits of the proposed transactions, including the synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities that the combined company expects. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. as a result, there page 32 can be no assurance that the merger will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. we will be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending and following the combination. uncertainty about the effect of the merger on jacobs' employees and business relationships may have an adverse effect on jacobs and on the combined company following the closing of the merger. our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain the talents and dedication of our key employees and the ability of the combined company to retain the talents and dedication of ch2m's key employees. employees may decide not to remain with the company or ch2m, as applicable, while the merger is pending. if key employees terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of employees are retained to maintain effective operations, our business activities may be adversely affected and management's attention may be diverted from successfully managing our business to hiring suitable replacements, any of which factors may cause our business to deteriorate. in addition, we or ch2m may not be able to motivate certain key employees during the pendency of the merger due to a perceived lack of appropriate opportunities for advancement or other reasons. in addition, uncertainties during the pendency of the merger may cause third parties who deal with the company and/or ch2m to seek to change existing business relationships with us or ch2m. moreover, customers' uncertainty about the effect of the merger, including the perception of potential conflicts of interest with respect to projects where ch2m assumes, or will assume, a project role and jacobs assumes, or will assume, a delivery role, and vice versa, may have an adverse effect on the ability of jacobs and/or ch2m to attract or retain customers or to win customer contracts. in addition, competitors may target the company's or ch2m's clients by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the merger. the pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration will require management attention and use of internal resources. any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any business difficulties resulting from the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. during the pendency of the merger and following the merger, our operating results and share price may be volatile, which could cause the value of our stockholder's investments to decline. during the pendency of the merger and following the merger, our quarterly and annual operating results, as well as our stock price, may fluctuate, and such fluctuations may be significant. such fluctuations may occur due to the accretion, or anticipated accretion, of the value of the merger, the progress and success of the integration process or the perception of such progress or success, additions or departures of key personnel, or sales of large blocks of stock or the perception that such sales may occur. jacobs expects to incur substantial indebtedness to finance the merger, which may decrease jacobs' business flexibility and could adversely impact jacobs' financial condition and results of operations. in addition to using cash on hand at jacobs and ch2m, jacobs intends to finance the cash component of the consideration payable to the ch2m stockholders in the merger, the repayment of ch2m's outstanding indebtedness and other transaction expenses with debt financing, which includes the jacobs term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion and additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility. jacobs currently estimates that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the merger will be approximately $1.9 billion. the financial and other covenants to which jacobs has agreed to, or may agree to in connection with the incurrence of new indebtedness, and the combined company's increased indebtedness may have the effect, among other things, of reducing the combined company's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing the combined company at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making the combined company more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions. the combined company's increased indebtedness will also increase borrowing costs, and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit the combined company's ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate requirements. the combined company will also be required to dedicate a larger portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. in addition, the terms and conditions of such debt may not be favorable to the combined company and, as such, could further increase the costs of the merger, as well as the overall burden of such debt upon the combined company and the combined company's business
