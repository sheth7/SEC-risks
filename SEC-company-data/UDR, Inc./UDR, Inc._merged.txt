employment growth potential. at december 31, 2012 , our consolidated apartment portfolio included 145 communities located in 22 markets, with a total of 41,571 completed apartment homes, which are held through our subsidiaries, including the operating partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. in addition, we have an ownership interest in 39 communities containing 9,558 apartment homes

prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for sale at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. our non-mature/other communities segment includes those communities that were acquired or developed in 2011 or 2012 , sold properties, redevelopment properties, properties classified as real estate held for sale, consolidated joint venture properties, properties managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components

limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, and developing apartment communities; empower site associates to manage

partnership did not have any acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2012 . when evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider: population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory 4 environment of the community in which the property is located; geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; construction quality, condition and design of the community; current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; potential for capital appreciation of the property; ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; high barrier-to-entry markets which are characterized by low single-family affordability and strong employment growth potential; terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. during 2012 , we sold 21 communities ( 6,507 apartment homes) for $609.4

concentration; and operating efficiencies. the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated year-end ownership position for the past five years

2012 , the company held 71.4% of its carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our core markets. during the year ended december 31, 2012 , 66.3% of the operating partnership's same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes located in our core markets of: seattle, washington; san francisco bay area, california; los angeles, california; orange county, california; san diego, california; austin, texas; dallas, texas; baltimore, maryland; and washington, d.c. at december 31, 2012 , the operating partnership held 81.0% of its carrying value of its real estate portfolio in its core markets. we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings. competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. in addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do. we believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. we believe our competitive advantages include: a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts; access to sources of capital; geographic diversification with a presence in 23 markets across the country; and significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. we believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio's strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside in spite of a weak economic environment. 9 communities at december 31, 2012 , our apartment portfolio included 145 consolidated communities having a total of 41,571 completed apartment homes and an additional 2,622 apartment homes under development, which included the operating partnership's apartment portfolio of 72 consolidated communities having a total of 21,660 completed apartment homes. the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents. at december 31, 2012 , the company is developing eight wholly-owned communities with 2,622 apartment homes, 76 of which have been completed. of these eight development communities, the operating partnership is developing two wholly-owned communities totaling 652 homes, none of which have been completed at december 31, 2012 . at december 31, 2012 , the company is redeveloping four wholly-owned communities with 2,253 apartment homes, 602 of which have been completed. of these four redevelopment communities, the operating partnership is redeveloping two wholly-owned communities with 964 apartment homes, of which 121 have been completed at december 31, 2012 . same store community comparison we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same store communities' net operating income ( noi ), which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses. our same store community population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. for the year ended december 31, 2012 , our same store noi increased by $21.6 million or 6.6% compared to the prior year. the increase in noi for the 33,823 apartment homes, or 70% of our portfolio, which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, and increased occupancy, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. for the year ended december 31, 2012 , the operating partnership's same store noi increased by $12.4 million or 6.5% compared to the prior year. the increase in noi for the 17,880 apartment homes, or 72% of the operating partnerships portfolio, which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in rental rates, and fee and reimbursement income, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. revenue growth in 2013 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents. tax matters udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, udr must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. provided we maintain our qualification as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may utilize our trs to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. however, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level. inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, property taxes, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their 10 ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2012 . environmental matters various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. to date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. we have a property management plan for hazardous materials. as part of the plan, phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. in addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. nevertheless, it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. in some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. we do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. in addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition. insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. we are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. 11 executive officers of the company udr is the sole general partner

the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership. the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily market and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, the downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments and real estate taxes, generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr's stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms; the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; declines in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. continued economic weakness following the economic recession that the u.s. economy recently experienced may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the u.s. economy continues to experience some weakness following a severe recession, including relatively high levels of unemployment and weak consumer spending. if the economic recovery slows or stalls, or if the economy experiences another recession, we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels, our rental revenues and the value of our properties, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. we are also exposed to risks relating to the housing market recovery that has accompanied the economic recovery, to the extent that when demand for single family homes increases, demand for apartments may decline, which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. 14 substantial international, national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. the values of, and the cash flows from, the properties we own are affected by developments in global, national and local economies. as a result of the most recent recession and the significant government interventions, federal, state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities. these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal, state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending, tax increases, public sector job losses, increased interest rates, currency devaluations or other adverse economic events, which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. the general risk of inflation is that our debt interest and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate higher than our rental rates. the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. high unemployment may have a negative effect on our occupancy levels and our rental revenues. we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities: a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single-and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition; even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete; when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. 15 competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to grow. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected; if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. in some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance. we have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities. as a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties' ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations. property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. if we use such a structure, we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. also, our joint venture partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. frequently, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners' interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of 16 our interest in the joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner's interest in the joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm's length marketing process. we also are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our joint venture partner, including (i) a deadlock if we and our joint venture partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the joint venture without the consent of the other joint venture partner, and (iii) the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture. we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which can be widely outside of our control. we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted resulting in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. in addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; inability to hire and retain key personnel; lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and inability to achieve budgeted financial results. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations. as the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. for example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future 17 contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or acm. environmental, health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. these requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if acm would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. in addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment. we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. real estate tax and other laws. generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. risk of damage from catastrophic weather events. certain of our communities are located in the general vicinity of mudslides and fires, and others where there are hurricanes, tornadoes or risks of other inclement weather. the adverse weather events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. risk of earthquake damage. some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. 18 insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. as a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management's view, economically impractical. risk of accidental death due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards. the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. we may acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. as a result, we may not recover some of or all our initial expenditure. in addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ' common stock. a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under gaap if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of udr's common stock. any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ' stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr's stock price. our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures. despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and keeping of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems' improper functioning, or 19 the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber attacks. security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us. our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by new federal laws and regulations. the united states administration and congress have enacted, or called for consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues, including with respect to health care, financial regulation reform, climate change, executive compensation and others. we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material. at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us. federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the recent economic downturn. these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression. the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21, 2010 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd-frank act ). many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. the dodd-frank act, including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable. changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular, including certain provisions of the dodd-frank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the u.s. public markets. because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure, our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. we may be adversely affected by new state and local laws and regulations. we are subject to state and local laws, regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. we cannot predict what matters might be considered in the future by these state and local authorities, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of new legislation might have on our business. the adoption of derivatives legislation by congress could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business. the dodd-frank act regulates derivative transactions, which include certain instruments used in our risk management activities. the dodd-frank act contemplates that most swaps will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility. there are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk and reits meeting certain criteria. while we may ultimately be eligible for such exceptions, we cannot ensure we will qualify for them. although the dodd-frank act includes significant new provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives, the impact of those requirements will not be known definitively until regulations have been adopted and fully implemented by both the sec and the commodities futures trading commission, and market participants establish registered clearing facilities under those regulations. the new legislation and any new regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available hedge counterparties to us. changes in the system for establishing u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ( gaap ). gaap is established by the financial 20 accounting standards board (the fasb ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. the international accounting standards board (the iasb ) is a london-based independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards ( ifrs ). ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world. ifrs differs in material respects from gaap. among other things, ifrs has historically relied more on fair value models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap. fair value models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities, often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap, which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation. we are monitoring the sec's activity with respect to the proposed adoption of ifrs by united states public companies. it is unclear at this time how the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted. in addition, switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs would be a complex undertaking. we would potentially need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs. since these are new endeavors, and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately to be adopted are not now known, the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain. we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations. such evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that would potentially be adopted. until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards that could be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations. risks related to our indebtedness and financings insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr's distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr's stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants' perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; competition from other apartment communities; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing. 21 expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. our debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. moody's and standard &amp; poor's, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt and preferred stock. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ' stock. our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. during the past few years, the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing. the potential downgrade of the u.s.'s credit rating and the european debt crisis have contributed to instability in global credit markets. continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our business. additionally, due to this uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr's common or preferred stock. the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of udr's common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business. prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels. tightening of credit in financial markets and high unemployment rates may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis. disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy. a change in u.s. government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business. fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate. we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans. in september 2008, the u.s. government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency. the administration has proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the u.s. that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets. uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not 22 possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2012, udr had approximately $454.5 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 13.3% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. as of december 31, 2012, the operating partnership had approximately $201.6 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 20.8% of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of udr's common and preferred stock and debt securities. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr's stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr's stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr's stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr's stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. 23 dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. in general, the maximum u.s. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual u.s. shareholders is 20%. unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit, our distributions to individual shareholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite udr's qualification as a reit, its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm's length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, udr is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to udr's stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr's ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws. as discussed in the risk factors above, because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr's stockholders. in the normal course of business, entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits. if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership, but cannot guarantee that it will qualify. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the operating partnership admits additional limited partners other than udr. if classified as a partnership, the operating partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability. however, the operating partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a publicly traded partnership, unless at least 90% of the operating partnership's income was qualifying income as defined in the code. a publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). although the operating partnership's partnership units are not traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption right, the operating partnership's units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the operating partnership may not qualify for one of the safe harbors under the applicable tax regulations. qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. the operating partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax 24 liabilities, and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code. our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification. moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit. our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. in addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. risks related to our organization and ownership of udr's stock changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ' common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange ( nyse ), on which we list udr's common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of udr's common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in udr's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. in addition to the risks listed in this risk factors section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr's common stock, including: general market and economic conditions; actual or anticipated variations in udr's quarterly operating results or dividends or udr's payment of dividends in shares of udr's stock; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt; decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of udr's stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; a change in analyst ratings; additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; speculation in the press or investment community; terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which udr's securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; failure to qualify as a reit; strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; failure to satisfy listing requirements of the nyse; 25 governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and the issuance of additional shares of udr's common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under udr's at-the-market equity distribution program. many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr's common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. we may change the dividend policy for udr ' common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr's common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr's common stock. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in udr ' stockholders ' best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in udr's stockholders' best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr's stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors' prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ' stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ' stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ' stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr's stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of udr's stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr's stockholders or might otherwise be in udr's stockholders' best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 67 quantitative and qualitative disclosures

investment trust, or reit, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the united states. the high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. at december 31, 2013 , our consolidated real estate portfolio included 141 communities located in 21 markets, with a total of 41,250 completed apartment homes, which are held through our subsidiaries, including the operating partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. in addition, we have an ownership interest in 37 communities containing 9,909 apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships. at december 31, 2013 , the company is developing six wholly-owned communities with 1,765 apartment homes, 422 of which have been completed, and one unconsolidated joint venture community with 447 apartment homes, none of which have been completed. at december 31, 2013 , the operating partnership's consolidated real estate portfolio included 68 communities located in 17 markets, with a total of 20,746 completed apartment homes. the operating partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the united states. during the year ended december 31, 2013 , revenues of the operating partnership represented approximately 54% of our total rental revenues. udr elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this report as the code . to continue to qualify as a reit, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. as a qualified reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. in 2013 , we declared total distributions of $0.94 per common share and paid dividends of $0.925 per common share. 1 dividends declared in 2013 dividends paid in 2013 first quarter $ 0.235 $ 0.220 second quarter 0.235 0.235 third quarter 0.235 0.235 fourth quarter 0.235 0.235 total $ 0.940 $ 0.925 udr was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation. in june 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland. the operating partnership is the successor-in-interest to united dominion realty, l.p., a limited partnership formed under the laws of virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. the operating partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a delaware limited partnership. our corporate offices are located at 1745 shea center drive, suite 200, highlands ranch, colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. our website is located at www.udr.com . as of february 18, 2014 , we had 1,593 full-time associates and 88 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by udr. reporting segments we report in two segments: same-store communities and non-mature communities/other . our ame-store communities segment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2012 , and held as of december 31, 2013 . these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for sale at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. our non-mature communities/other segment includes those communities that were acquired or developed in 2011, 2012 or 2013 , sold properties, redevelopment properties, properties classified as real estate held for sale, consolidated joint venture properties, properties managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. for additional information regarding our operating segments, see note 15, reportable segments , in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report and note 12, reportable segments , in the notes to the operating partnership's consolidated financial statements included in this report. business objectives our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. to achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies: own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities; empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively; measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of earnings and dividends. 2013 highlights in july 2013, the company marked its 41st year as a reit and paid its 164th consecutive quarterly dividend in october. the company's annualized declared 2013 dividend of $0.94 represented a 7% increase over the previous year. we achieved same-store revenue growth of 4.9% and same-store net operating income ( noi ) growth of 6.0%. 2 during the year ended december, 31, 2013, we invested approximately $279.6 million in wholly-owned development projects and $92.1 million in redevelopment projects, including completion of 904 development apartment homes and 837 redevelopment apartment homes in targeted core markets. we expanded our relationship with the metropolitan life insurance company ( metlife ): formed five 50%/50% partnerships in our vitruvian park master plan development project consisting of three operating communities and approximately 28 acres of developable land in addison, texas. in connection with the formation of the five partnerships, we sold 50% of our interests in the three operating communities and the developable land to metlife for approximately $141.3 million. expanded the udr/metlife ii joint venture by increasing our ownership interests in two a-quality, high-rise communities located in denver, colorado and san diego, california in exchange for our ownership interests in four non-core udr/metlife i joint venture communities plus an additional $15.6 million in cash. formed a 51%/49% joint venture with metlife to develop a $318 million, 447-home high-rise located in the rincon hill neighborhood of san francisco, california. in connection with the formation, we sold 49% of our interest to metlife for approximately $29.9 million. we issued $300 million of 3.70%, 7-year senior unsecured medium-term notes in september. net proceeds were used to repay indebtedness on our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. we amended and favorably re-priced our $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility and $350 million of unsecured term notes. we sold our 95% interest in a recently developed joint venture community, the lodge at stoughton, located in metro boston, for $48.5 million, resulting in a gain (before tax) of approximately $8.3 million. we entered into a participating debt financing arrangement with a third party that is developing a $108 million, 218-home, high-rise luxury community located in the cherry creek neighborhood of metro denver. other than the following, there were no significant changes to the operating partnership's business during 2013 (the above 2013 highlights relate to udr or other subsidiaries of udr): we exited the sacramento market through the disposition of two communities for gross proceeds $81.1 million resulting in a gain of approximately $41.5 million. refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for further information on the company's and the operating partnership's activities in 2013. our strategies and vision our vision is to be the innovative multifamily public reit of choice. our strategic priorities are: 1. strengthen the quality of our portfolio 2. flexible/strong balance sheet 3. increase cash flow to support dividend growth 4. a great place to work and live capital allocation acquisitions and dispositions when evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider: population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located; geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; construction quality, condition and design of the property; 3 current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; potential for capital appreciation of the property; ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; whether it is located in a high barrier-to-entry market; terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include: current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset; potential increases in new construction in the market area; areas with low job growth prospects; markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and operating efficiencies. the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated year-end ownership position for the past five years ( dollars in thousands ): 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 homes acquired 633 3,161 1,374 289 homes disposed 914 6,507 4,488 149 homes owned at december 31 41,250 41,571 47,343 48,553 45,913 total

value while improving the quality of our portfolio. demographic trends, economic drivers, and how multifamily fundamentals/valuations have trended over the long-term govern our review process on where to allocate development capital. at december 31, 2013, our development pipeline for six wholly-owned communities located in san francisco, california; huntington beach, california; mission viejo, california; boston, massachusetts; college park, maryland; and alexandria, virginia totaled 1,765 homes, 422 of which have been completed, with a budget of $697.6 million in which we have a carrying value of $467.4 million. redevelopment activities our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. during 2013, we continued to redevelop properties in targeted markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. at december 31, 2013, the company is redeveloping 1,423 apartment homes, 1,008 of which have been completed, at two wholly-owned communities with 1,670 apartment homes located in new york, new york and costa mesa, california. the scope of the redevelopments at both projects changed in the fourth quarter. the budget for our rivergate project in manhattan expanded due to the identification of further 4 revenue generating opportunities, while we tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 seventy five mesa verde project in orange county due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we incurred $112.7 million in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. joint venture activities we have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (ii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement. the operating partnership is not a party to any of the joint venture activities described above. balance sheet management we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate. financing activities as part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities. operational excellence, cash flow and dividend growth investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. since its launch in january 2009, our residents have been utilizing our web-based resident internet portal on our website. our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. in july 2010, we completed the roll out of online leasing renewals throughout our portfolio. as a result of transforming our operations through technology, resident's satisfaction improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes. in 2013, udr rolled out an online leasing platform that allows prospects to apply directly online. as of december 31, 2013, over 40% of our leases have been processed using online leasing. we also focused heavily on conversion optimization of our traffic through udr.com, which resulted in a 14% increase from the prior year. portfolio improvement we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research. for the year ended december 31, 2013, approximately 69.5% of our same-store net operating income ( noi ) was generated by communities located in our core markets of: seattle, washington; san francisco bay area, california; los angeles, california; orange county, california; san diego, california; austin, texas; dallas, texas; boston, massachusetts; new york, new york; baltimore, maryland; and metropolitan d.c. operating partnership strategies and vision the operating partnership's long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology. as a result, the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in new york, new york; san francisco bay area, 5 california; boston, massachusetts; and metropolitan d.c. markets over the past years. prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns. markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth, low single-family home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing, which are three key drivers to strong rental growth. markets and competitive conditions during the year ended december 31, 2013 , 69.5% of our consolidated same-store net operating income ( noi ) was generated from apartment homes located in our core markets. at december 31, 2013 , the company held 74.5% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our core markets. during the year ended december 31, 2013 , 77.8% of the operating partnership's same-store noi was generated from apartment homes located in our core markets. at december 31, 2013 , the operating partnership held 81.1% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio in its core markets. we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings. competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. in addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do. we believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. we believe our competitive advantages include: a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts; access to sources of capital; geographic diversification with a presence in 21 markets across the country; and significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. we believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio's strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside. communities at december 31, 2013 , our consolidated real estate portfolio included 141 communities with a total of 41,250 completed apartment homes, which included the operating partnership's consolidated real estate portfolio of 68 communities with a total of 20,746 completed apartment homes. the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents. at december 31, 2013 , the company is developing six wholly-owned communities with 1,765 apartment homes, 422 of which have been completed. of these six development communities, the operating partnership is developing one wholly-owned community totaling 332 homes, none of which have been completed at december 31, 2013 . in addition, at december 31, 2013, the company had two communities with 731 apartment homes which were completed but not yet stabilized. at december 31, 2013 , the company is redeveloping 1,423 apartment homes, 1,008 of which have been completed, at two wholly-owned communities with 1,670 apartment homes. the scope of the redevelopments at both projects changed in the fourth quarter. the budget for our rivergate project in manhattan expanded due to the identification of further revenue generating opportunities, while we tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 seventy five mesa verde project in orange county due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket. the operating partnership owns 27 seventy five mesa verde . 6 same-store community comparison we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same-store communities' noi, which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses. our same-store community population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. for the year ended december 31, 2013 , our same-store noi increased by $23.9 million or 6.0% compared to the prior year. our same-store community properties provided 83% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in noi for the 35,790 same-store apartment homes, or 87% of our portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, and increased occupancy, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. for the year ended december 31, 2013 , the operating partnership's same-store noi increased by $13.3 million or 5.9% compared to the prior year. our same-store community properties provided 84% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in noi for the 18,616 same-store apartment homes, or 90% of the operating partnership's portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, and increased occupancy, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. revenue growth in 2014 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents. tax matters udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, udr must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. provided we maintain our qualification as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary ( trs ), re 3 , to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. however, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level. inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, property taxes, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of 14 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2013 . environmental matters various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. to date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. we have a property management plan for hazardous materials. as part of 7 the plan, phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. in addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. in some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. we do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. in addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. we are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment

of the company and the operating partnership. the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments and real estate taxes, generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr's stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms; the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; declines in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire. when our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. if residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase. continued economic weakness following the economic recession that the u.s. economy recently experienced may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the u.s. economy continues to experience 10 some weakness following a severe recession, including relatively high levels of unemployment and weak consumer spending. in addition, while the federal reserve took policy actions to promote market liquidity and encourage economic growth following the recession, such actions are now being curtailed as signs of improvement in the economy have emerged, and the impact of these monetary policy actions on the economy is uncertain. if the economic recovery slows or stalls, or if the economy experiences another recession, we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels, our rental revenues and the value of our properties, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. we are also exposed to risks relating to the housing market recovery that has accompanied the economic recovery, to the extent that when demand for single family homes increases, demand for apartments may decline, which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. substantial international, national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. the values of, and the cash flows from, the properties we own are affected by developments in global, national and local economies. as a result of the most recent recession and the significant government interventions, federal, state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities. these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal, state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending, tax increases, public sector job losses, increased interest rates, currency devaluations or other adverse economic events, which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate higher than our rental rates. the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities: a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single-and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition; 11 even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete; when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; the expected occupancy rates and rental rates may differ from actual results; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected; if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. in some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance. we have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities. as a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result 12 in services not being provided, projects not being completed on time, or on budget, or at all, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties' ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations. property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. we currently have 10 active joint ventures and partnerships, excluding our participating loan investment, with a total equity investment of $493.4 million. we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. also, our joint venture partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. frequently, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners' interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner's interest in the joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm's length marketing process. we are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our joint venture partner, including (i) a deadlock if we and our joint venture partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the joint venture without the consent of the other joint venture partner, and (iii) the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture. we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program with limits of liability customary within the multi-family industry covering our property and operating activities. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which are generally outside of our control. we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted resulting in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. in addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; inability to hire and retain key personnel; lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and inability to achieve budgeted financial results. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and 13 remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations. as the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. for example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or acm. environmental, health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. these requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if acm would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. in addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment. we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. real estate tax and other laws. generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing 14 amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change. certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas. should the impact of such climate change be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. risk of earthquake damage. some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. as a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management's view, economically impractical. risk of accidental death due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards. the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. we may acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. as a result, we may not recover some of or all our initial expenditure. in addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ' common stock. a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under gaap if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized 15 cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of udr's common stock. any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ' stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr's stock price. our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or breaches in data security. despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and keeping of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems' improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber attacks. security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us. our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by new federal laws and regulations. the united states administration and congress have enacted, or called for consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues, including with respect to health care, financial regulation reform, climate change, executive compensation and others. we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material. at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us. federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the recent economic downturn. these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression. the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21, 2010 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd-frank act ). many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. the dodd-frank act, including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable. changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular, including certain provisions of the dodd-frank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the u.s. public markets. because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure, our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and 16 administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. we may be adversely affected by new state and local laws and regulations. we are subject to state and local laws, regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. we cannot predict what matters might be considered in the future by these state and local authorities, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of new legislation might have on our business. derivatives legislation adopted by congress could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business. the dodd-frank act regulates derivative transactions, which include certain instruments used in our risk management activities. the dodd-frank act contemplates that most swaps will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility. there are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk and reits meeting certain criteria. while we may ultimately be eligible for such exceptions, we cannot ensure we will qualify for them. although the dodd-frank act includes significant new provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives, the impact of those requirements will not be known definitively until regulations have been adopted and fully implemented by both the sec and the commodities futures trading commission, and market participants establish and operate registered clearing facilities under those regulations. the dodd-frank act provisions regarding derivatives and the implementing regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available hedge counterparties to us. changes in the system for establishing u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ( gaap ). gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board (the fasb ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. the international accounting standards board (the iasb ) is a london-based independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards ( ifrs ). ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world. ifrs differs in material respects from gaap. among other things, ifrs has historically relied more on fair value models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap. fair value models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities, often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap, which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation. we are monitoring the sec's activity with respect to the proposed adoption of ifrs by united states public companies. it is unclear at this time how the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted. in addition, switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs would be a complex undertaking. we would potentially need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs. since these are new endeavors, and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately to be adopted are not now known, the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain. we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations. such evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that would potentially be adopted. until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards that could be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations. risks related to our indebtedness and financings insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr's distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. 17 failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr's stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants' perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; competition from other apartment communities; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing. expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. our debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. moody's and standard &amp; poor's, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt and preferred stock. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ' stock. our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. during the past several years, the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing. the potential downgrade of the u.s.'s credit rating and the european debt crisis recently contributed to instability in global credit markets. continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our business. additionally, due to this uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties 18 on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr's common or preferred stock. the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of udr's common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business. prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels. tightening of credit in financial markets and high unemployment rates may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis. disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy. a change in u.s. government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business. fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate. we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans. in september 2008, the u.s. government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency. the administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the u.s. that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets. uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2013, udr had approximately $404.7 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 11.5% of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. as of december 31, 2013, the operating partnership had approximately $169.1 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 18.1% of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of udr's common and preferred stock and debt securities. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. 19 risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr's stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr's stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr's stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr's stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. in general, the maximum u.s. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual u.s. shareholders is 20%. unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit, our distributions to individual shareholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite udr's qualification as a reit, its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm's length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, udr is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to udr's stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr's ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws. as discussed in the risk factors above, because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but 20 it is subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr's stockholders. in the normal course of business, entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits. if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership, but cannot guarantee that it will qualify. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the operating partnership admits additional limited partners other than udr. if classified as a partnership, the operating partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability. however, the operating partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a publicly traded partnership, unless at least 90% of the operating partnership's income was qualifying income as defined in the code. a publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). although the operating partnership's partnership units are not traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption right, the operating partnership's units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the operating partnership may not qualify for one of the safe harbors under the applicable tax regulations. qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. the operating partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax liabilities, and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code. our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification. moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit. our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. in addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. risks related to our organization and ownership of udr's stock changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ' common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange ( nyse ), on which we list udr's common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of udr's common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in udr's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. in addition to the risks listed in this risk factors section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr's common stock, including: general market and economic conditions; actual or anticipated variations in udr's quarterly operating results or dividends or udr's payment of dividends in shares of udr's stock; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt; decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; 21 the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of udr's stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; a change in analyst ratings; additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; speculation in the press or investment community; terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which udr's securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; failure to qualify as a reit; strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; failure to satisfy listing requirements of the nyse; governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and the issuance of additional shares of udr's common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under udr's at-the-market equity distribution program. many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr's common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. we may change the dividend policy for udr ' common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr's common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr's common stock. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in udr ' stockholders ' best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in udr's stockholders' best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr's stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors' prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ' stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ' stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ' stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr's stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the 22 person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of udr's stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr's stockholders or might otherwise be in udr's stockholders' best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market

business general udr is a self-administered real estate investment trust, or reit, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the united states. the high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. at december 31, 2014 , our consolidated real estate portfolio included 139 communities located in 20 markets, with a total of 39,851 completed apartment homes, which are held through our subsidiaries, including the operating partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. in addition, we have an ownership interest in 36 communities containing 10,055 apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships. as of december 31, 2014 , the company was developing one wholly-owned community with 369 apartment homes and three unconsolidated joint venture communities with 1,018 apartment homes, none of which have been completed. at december 31, 2014 , the operating partnership's consolidated real estate portfolio included 68 communities located in 17 markets, with a total of 20,814 completed apartment homes. the operating partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the united states. during the year ended december 31, 2014 , revenues of the operating partnership represented approximately 52% of our total rental revenues. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this report as the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. in 2014 , we declared total distributions of $1.04 per common share and paid dividends of $1.015 per common share. dividends declared in 2014 dividends paid in 2014 first quarter $ 0.260 $ 0.235 second quarter

virginia to maryland. the operating partnership is the successor-in-interest to united dominion realty, l.p., a limited partnership formed under the laws of virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. the operating partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a delaware limited partnership. our corporate offices are located at 1745 shea center drive, suite 200, highlands ranch, colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. our website is www.udr.com . the information contained on our website, including any information referred to in this report as being available on our website, is not a part of or incorporated into this report. as of february 19, 2015 , we had 1,523 full-time associates and 59 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by udr. reporting segments we report in two segments: same-store communities and non-mature communities/other . our ame-store communities segment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2013 , and held as of december 31, 2014 . these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for sale at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. 2 our non-mature communities/other segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. for additional information regarding our operating segments, see note 15, reportable segments , in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report and note 12, reportable segments , in the notes to the operating partnership's consolidated financial statements included in this report. business objectives our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. to achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies: own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities; empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively; measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of earnings and dividends. 2014 highlights in july 2014, the company marked its 42nd year as a reit and paid its 168th consecutive quarterly dividend in october. the company's annualized declared 2014 dividend of $1.04 represented a 10.6% increase over the previous year. we achieved same-store revenue growth of 4.3% and same-store net operating income ( noi ) growth of 5.2%. during the year ended december, 31, 2014, we invested approximately $251.5 million in wholly-owned development projects and $31.5 million in redevelopment projects and major renovations, including completion of 980 development apartment homes and 401 redevelopment apartment homes in primary markets. we expanded our relationship with the metropolitan life insurance company ( metlife ): we increased our ownership interest in the remaining six operating communities in the udr/metlife i joint venture from 12% to 50%, and metlife and the company contributed the communities to the udr/metlife ii joint venture. we paid metlife $82.5 million for the additional ownership interests. we increased our ownership interest in four land sites in the udr/metlife i joint venture from approximately 3% to 50%. the remaining interest continues to be held by our joint venture partner metlife. we paid metlife approximately $36.8 million for the additional ownership interests. we sold 50% of our interest in 3033 wilshire and 49% of our interest in 13th and market to metlife for gross proceeds of approximately $62.5 million, resulting in the assets being held by unconsolidated joint ventures. we issued $300 million of 3.75%, 10-year senior unsecured medium-term notes in june. net proceeds were used to pay down borrowings outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. we completed five developments containing 1,396 homes for an estimated aggregate cost of $480.0 million. we acquired land parcels for future development located in huntington beach, california for $77.8 million and boston, massachusetts for $32.2 million . we acquired two communities located in seattle, washington and kirkland, washington with a total of 358 apartment homes for $45.5 million and $75.2 million, respectively. we recognized gains on the sale of real estate of $143.6 million , net of tax, which consisted of: 3 the sale of nine communities with a total of 2,500 apartment homes, an adjacent parcel of land, and one operating property for gross proceeds of $328.4 million, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of approximately $138.6 million; and the sale of our 49% interest in a recently completed development for gross proceeds of $54.2 million, resulting in a gain, net of tax, of $7.2 million and our 50% interest in a land parcel for gross proceeds of $8.3 million, resulting in a loss, net of tax, of $2.2 million. we sold common stock under our amended equity distribution agreement for net proceeds of approximately $99.8 million , which was primarily used to fund the company's steele creek participating loan investment. other than the following, there were no significant changes to the operating partnership's business during 2014 (the above 2014 highlights relate to udr or other subsidiaries of udr): the operating partnership sold one operating community and an adjacent parcel of land in san diego, california for gross proceeds of $48.7 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $24.4 million and net proceeds of $47.9 million . the operating partnership also recorded gains of $39.2 million in connection with udr's sale of two communities in tampa, florida and los angeles, california, which were previously deferred. refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for further information on the company's and the operating partnership's activities in 2014 . our strategies and vision our vision is to be the innovative multifamily public reit of choice. our strategic priorities are: 1. strengthen the quality of our portfolio 2. flexible/strong balance sheet 3. increase cash flow to support dividend growth 4. a great place to work and live capital allocation acquisitions and dispositions when evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider: population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located; geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; construction quality, condition and design of the property; current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; potential for capital appreciation of the property; ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; whether it is located in a high barrier-to-entry market; terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include: current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset; 4 potential increases in new construction in the market area; areas with low job growth prospects; markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and operating efficiencies. the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated year-end ownership position for the past five years ( dollars in

while improving the quality of our portfolio. demographic trends, economic drivers, and how multifamily fundamentals/valuations have trended over the long-term govern our review process on where to allocate development capital. at december 31, 2014, our development pipeline included one wholly-owned community located in boston, massachusetts with 369 homes and a budget of $217.7 million, in which we have a carrying value of $177.6 million. redevelopment activities our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. during 2014, we continued to redevelop properties in primary markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. at december 31, 2014, the company was redeveloping 708 apartment homes, 694 of which have been completed, at one wholly-owned community with 739 apartment homes located in new york, new york. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we incurred $31.5 million in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. joint venture activities we have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement. the operating partnership is not a party to any of the joint venture activities described above. balance sheet management 5 we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate. financing activities as part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities. operational excellence, cash flow and dividend growth investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. since its launch in january 2009, our residents have been utilizing our web-based resident internet portal on our website. our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio. we launched a new website at the end of 2014. this is the third major revision of udr.com, and represents a complete rebuild of our on-line presence. it was completed after several months of research with customer focus groups that told us what they wanted to see in an on-line shopping experience. the new website features elements such as on-line appointment scheduling, enhanced neighborhood information, and comparison shopping tools, all of which are available via any device the customer may choose. to date, we are exceeding our initial targets for the site by converting a higher than expected amount of traffic to community visits. as a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents' satisfaction improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes. portfolio improvement we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research. for the year ended december 31, 2014, approximately 65.0% of our same-store noi was generated by communities located in our primary markets of: seattle, washington; san francisco bay area, california; los angeles, california; orange county, california; austin, texas; dallas, texas; boston, massachusetts; new york, new york; and metropolitan d.c. operating partnership strategies and vision the operating partnership's long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology. as a result, the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in new york, new york; san francisco bay area, california; boston, massachusetts; and metropolitan d.c. over the past years. prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns. markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth, low single-family home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing, which are three key drivers to strong rental growth. markets and competitive conditions during the year ended december 31, 2014 , 65.0% of our consolidated same-store noi was generated from apartment homes located in our primary markets. at december 31, 2014 , the company held 70.7% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our primary markets. during the year ended december 31, 2014 , 72.9% of the operating partnership's same-store noi was generated from apartment homes located in our primary markets. at december 31, 2014 , the operating partnership held 76.1% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio in its primary markets. we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings. competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. in addition, 6 other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do. we believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. we believe our competitive advantages include: a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts; access to sources of capital; geographic diversification with a presence in 20 markets across the country; and significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. we believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio's strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside. communities at december 31, 2014 , our consolidated real estate portfolio included 139 communities with a total of 39,851 completed apartment homes, which included the operating partnership's consolidated real estate portfolio of 68 communities with a total of 20,814 completed apartment homes. the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents. at december 31, 2014 , the company was developing one wholly-owned community with 369 apartment homes, none of which have been completed. in addition, at december 31, 2014, the company had three communities with 825 apartment homes which were completed but not yet stabilized. at december 31, 2014 , the company was redeveloping 708 apartment homes, 694 of which have been completed, at one wholly-owned community with 739 apartment homes. same-store community comparison we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same-store communities' noi, which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses. our same-store community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. for the year ended december 31, 2014 , our same-store noi increased by $21.6 million or 5.2% compared to the prior year. our same-store community properties provided 79.2% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in noi for the 34,581 same-store apartment homes, or 86.8% of our portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, and increased occupancy, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes and insurance expenses. for the year ended december 31, 2014 , the operating partnership's same-store noi increased by $15.2 million or 6.1% compared to the prior year. our same-store community properties provided 88.1% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in noi for the 19,010 same-store apartment homes, or 91.3% of the operating partnership's portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, and increased occupancy, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. revenue growth in 2015 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the economy generally, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents. tax matters 7 udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, udr must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. provided we maintain our qualification as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary ( trs ) to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. however, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level. inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, property taxes, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of 14 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2014 . environmental matters various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. to date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. we have a property management plan for hazardous materials. as part of the plan, phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. in addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. in some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. we do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. in addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not 8 currently actionable. also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. we are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. available information both udr and the

affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership. the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr's stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms; 9 the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; declines in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire. when our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. if residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase. substantial international, national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. the values of, and the cash flows from, the properties we own are affected by developments in global, national and local economies. as a result of the most recent recession and the significant government interventions, federal, state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities. these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal, state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending, tax increases, public sector job losses, increased interest rates, currency devaluations or other adverse economic events, which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities: a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single-and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks: 10 we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition; even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete; when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; the expected occupancy rates and rental rates may differ from actual results; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected; if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. 11 in some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance. we have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities. as a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided, projects not being completed on time, or on budget, or at all, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties' ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations. property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. we currently have 15 active joint ventures and partnerships, excluding our participating loan investment, with a total equity investment of $655.5 million. we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. also, our joint venture partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. in general, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners' interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner's interest in the joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm's length marketing process. we are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our joint venture partner, including (i) a deadlock if we and our joint venture partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the joint venture without the consent of the other joint venture partner, and (iii) the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture. we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities with limits of liability customary within the multi-family industry. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which are generally outside of our control. we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. in addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; 12 inability to hire and retain key personnel; lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and inability to achieve budgeted financial results. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations. as the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. for example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or acm. environmental, health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. these requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if acm would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. in addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment. we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not 13 know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change. certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas. should the impact of such climate change be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. risk of earthquake damage. some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. as a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management's view, economically impractical. risk of accidental death due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards. the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. we may acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower 14 bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. as a result, we may not recover some of or all our initial expenditure. in addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ' common stock. a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ( gaap ), if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of udr's common stock. any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ' stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr's stock price. our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or breaches in data security. despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and keeping of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems' improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber attacks. security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us. our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by new federal laws and regulations. the united states administration and congress have enacted, or called for consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues, including with respect to health care, financial regulation reform, climate change, executive compensation and others. we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material. at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us. federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the most recent economic recession. these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression. the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21, 2010 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd-frank act ). many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and continue to require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. the dodd-frank act, including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are 15 proposed or pending in the united states congress, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable. changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular, including certain provisions of the dodd-frank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the u.s. public markets. because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure, our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. we may be adversely affected by new state and local laws and regulations. we are subject to state and local laws, regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. we cannot predict what matters might be considered in the future by these state and local authorities, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of new legislation might have on our business. changes in u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap, which is established by the financial accounting standards board (the fasb ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the fasb and the sec, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for u.s. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. risks related to our indebtedness and financings insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr's distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr's stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants' perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; competition from other apartment communities; 16 changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing. expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. our debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. moody's and standard &amp; poor's, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt and preferred stock. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ' stock. our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it, the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably. those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing. any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr's common stock. if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr's common or preferred stock. a change in u.s. government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business. fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate. we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans. in september 2008, the u.s. government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency. the administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the u.s. that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets. uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. 17 the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2014, udr had approximately $579.7 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 16.1% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. as of december 31, 2014, the operating partnership had approximately $219.8 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 23.6% of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of udr's common and preferred stock and debt securities. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr's stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr's stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr's stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr's stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as a reit under the code, and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that they fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year. 18 dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. in general, the maximum u.s. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual u.s. stockholders is 20%. unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit, our distributions to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite udr's qualification as a reit, its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm's length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, udr is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to udr's stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr's ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws. as discussed in the risk factors above, because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr's stockholders. in the normal course of business, entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits. if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership, but cannot guarantee that it will qualify. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the operating partnership admits additional limited partners other than udr. if classified as a partnership, the operating partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability. however, the operating partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a publicly traded partnership, unless at least 90% of the operating partnership's income was qualifying income as defined in the code. a publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). although the operating partnership's partnership units are not traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption right, the operating partnership's units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the operating partnership may not qualify for one of the safe harbors under the applicable tax regulations. qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. the operating partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax 19 liabilities, and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code. our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification. moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit. our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. in addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. risks related to our organization and ownership of udr's stock changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ' common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange ( nyse ), on which we list udr's common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of udr's common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in udr's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. in addition to the risks listed in this risk factors section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr's common stock, including: general market and economic conditions; actual or anticipated variations in udr's quarterly operating results or dividends or udr's payment of dividends in shares of udr's stock; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt; decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of udr's stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; a change in analyst ratings; additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; speculation in the press or investment community; terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which udr's securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; failure to qualify as a reit; strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; 20 failure to satisfy listing requirements of the nyse; governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and the issuance of additional shares of udr's common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under udr's at-the-market equity distribution program. many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr's common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. we may change the dividend policy for udr ' common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr's common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr's common stock. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in udr ' stockholders ' best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in udr's stockholders' best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr's stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors' prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ' stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ' stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ' stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr's stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of udr's stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr's stockholders or might otherwise be in udr's stockholders' best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 63 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in

redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets throughout the united states. the high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. at december 31, 2015 , our consolidated real estate portfolio included 133 communities located in 18 markets, with a total of 40,728 completed apartment homes, which are held through our subsidiaries, including the operating partnership and the downreit partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. in addition, we have an ownership interest in 28 communities containing 6,696 apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships. as of december 31, 2015 , the company was developing one wholly-owned community with 516 apartment homes and four unconsolidated joint venture communities with 1,173 apartment homes, none of which have been completed. at december 31, 2015 , the operating partnership's consolidated real estate portfolio included 57 communities located in 14 markets, with a total of 16,974 completed apartment homes. the operating partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the united states. during the year ended december 31, 2015 , revenues of the operating partnership represented approximately 51% of our total rental revenues. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this report as the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. in 2015 , we declared total distributions of $1.11 per common share and paid dividends of $1.0925 per common share. dividends declared in 2015 dividends paid in 2015 first quarter $ 0.2775 $ 0.2600 second quarter 0.2775 0.2775 third quarter 0.2775 0.2775 fourth quarter 0.2775 0.2775 total $ 1.1100 $ 1.0925 udr was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation. in june 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland. the operating partnership is the successor-in-interest to united dominion realty, l.p., a limited partnership formed under the laws of virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. the operating partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a delaware limited partnership. our corporate offices are located at 1745 shea center drive, suite 200, highlands ranch, colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. our website is www.udr.com . the information contained on our website, including any information referred to in this report as being available on our website, is not a part of or incorporated into this report. as of february 22, 2016 , we had 1,569 full-time associates and 42 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by udr. reporting segments we report in two segments: same-store communities and non-mature communities/other . our ame-store communities segment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2014 , and held as of december 31, 2015 . these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for sale at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. 3 our non-mature communities/other segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. for additional information regarding our operating segments, see note 15, reportable segments , in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report and note 13, reportable segments , in the notes to the operating partnership's consolidated financial statements included in this report. business objectives our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. to achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies: own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities; empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively; measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of earnings and dividends. 2015 highlights in july 2015, the company marked its 43rd year as a reit and paid its 172nd consecutive quarterly dividend in october. the company's annualized declared 2015 dividend of $1.11 represented a 6.7% increase over the previous year. we achieved same-store revenue growth of 5.6% and same-store net operating income ( noi ) growth of 6.7%. we completed one development in boston, ma containing 369 homes for an aggregate cost of approximately $217.7 million. we also completed the redevelopment of 708 homes at a community in new york, ny for an aggregate cost of approximately $98.0 million. as of december 31, 2015, we were developing one wholly-owned community and four communities in unconsolidated joint ventures and redeveloping three wholly-owned communities. in october 2015, the company completed the acquisition of six washington, d.c. area properties from home properties, l.p. ( home op ) for a total contractual purchase price of $900.6 million , which was comprised of $564.8 million of downreit units in the newly formed downreit partnership, the assumption of $89.3 million of debt, $221.0 million of reverse tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 ( section 1031 exchanges ), and $25.5 million of cash. the company holds a 50.1% (including a 41.6% interest held indirectly through the operating partnership) controlling ownership interest in, and consolidates, the downreit partnership. for additional information regarding the downreit partnership, see note 11, noncontrolling interests , in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report. we contributed $136.3 million for a preferred equity investment in five west coast communities that are currently under construction. we recognized gains on the sale of real estate of $251.7 million from the sale of 12 communities with a total of 2,735 apartment homes. a portion of the sale proceeds was designated for tax-deferred section 1031 exchanges for a 2014 acquisition and the october 2015 acquisitions described above. the eight communities held by the texas joint venture were sold, generating net proceeds to udr of $44.2 million. the company recorded promote and disposition fee income of $10.0 million and a gain of $59.4 million (including $24.2 million of previously deferred gains). we sold 6,339,636 shares of common stock through public offerings for net proceeds of approximately $210.0 million . we entered into a new $1.1 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date in january 2020, exclusive of options to extend, which replaced the prior $900 million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in december 2017, 4 and entered into a $350.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility due january 2021, which replaced the company's $250 million term loan and $100 million term loan that were scheduled to mature in june 2018. we issued $300 million of 4.00%, 10-year senior unsecured medium-term notes in september. refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for further information on the company's and the operating partnership's activities in 2015 . our strategies and vision our vision is to be the innovative multifamily public reit of choice. our strategic priorities are: 1. strengthen the quality of our portfolio 2. flexible/strong balance sheet 3. increase cash flow to support dividend growth 4. a great place to work and live capital allocation acquisitions and dispositions when evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider: population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located; geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; construction quality, condition and design of the property; current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; potential for capital appreciation of the property; ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; whether it is located in a high barrier-to-entry market; terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include: current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset; potential increases in new construction in the market area; areas with low job growth prospects; markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and operating efficiencies. 5 the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated year-end ownership position for the past five years ( dollars in thousands ): 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 homes acquired 3,246 358 633 3,161 homes disposed 2,735 2,500 914 6,507 4,488 homes owned at december 31, 40,728 39,851 41,250 41,571

deconsolidated in 2015 upon contribution of communities by the operating partnership to the downreit partnership. development activities our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio. demographic trends, economic drivers, and how multifamily fundamentals/valuations have trended over the long-term govern our review process on where to allocate development capital. at december 31, 2015 , our development pipeline included one wholly-owned community located in huntington beach, california with 516 homes and a budget of $342.0 million , in which we have a carrying value of $124.1 million . redevelopment activities our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. during 2015 , we continued to redevelop properties in primary markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. at december 31, 2015 , the company was redeveloping all 264 apartment homes, 11 of which have been completed, at two wholly-owned communities located in san francisco, california and bellevue, washington. the company also was redeveloping one wholly-owned community in san francisco, california with renovations to the building exterior, corridors, and common area amenities, with no impact to individual homes. during the year ended december 31, 2015 , we incurred $32.9 million in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. joint venture and partnership activities we have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement. balance sheet management we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate. 6 financing activities as part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities. operational excellence, cash flow and dividend growth investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our web-based resident internet portal. as a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents' satisfaction improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes. portfolio improvement we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research. for the year ended december 31, 2015 , approximately 69.5% of our consolidated same-store noi was generated by communities located in our primary markets of: seattle, washington; san francisco bay area, california; los angeles, california; orange county, california; austin, texas; dallas, texas; boston, massachusetts; new york, new york; and metropolitan d.c. at december 31, 2015 , the company held 75.4% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our primary markets. for the year ended december 31, 2015 , approximately 73.1% of the operating partnership's same-store noi was generated by communities located in our primary markets and 73.7% of its same-store carrying value of its real estate portfolio was generated in its primary markets. operating partnership strategies and vision the operating partnership's long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology. as a result, the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in new york, new york; san francisco bay area, california; boston, massachusetts; and metropolitan d.c. over the past years. prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns. markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth, low single-family home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing, which are three key drivers to strong rental growth. competitive conditions competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors, including sub-market supply and demand. in addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do. we believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. we believe our competitive advantages include: a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts; access to sources of capital; geographic diversification with a presence in 18 markets across the country; and 7 significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. we believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio's strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside. communities at december 31, 2015 , our consolidated real estate portfolio included 133 communities with a total of 40,728 completed apartment homes, which included the operating partnership's consolidated real estate portfolio of 57 communities with a total of 16,974 completed apartment homes. the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents. at december 31, 2015 , the company was developing one wholly-owned community with 516 apartment homes, none of which have been completed. the community being developed is not part of the operating partnership's real estate portfolio. at december 31, 2015 , the company was redeveloping 264 apartment homes, 11 of which have been completed, at two wholly-owned communities. the company was also was redeveloping one wholly-owned community, with renovations to the building exterior, corridors, and common area amenities, with no impact to individual homes. two of these communities under redevelopment are held by the operating partnership. same-store community comparison we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same-store communities' noi, which is total rental revenue, less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management. our same-store community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. for the year ended december 31, 2015 , our same-store noi increase d by $29.5 million compared to the prior year. our same-store community properties provided 76.4% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2015 . the increase in noi for the 33,063 same-store apartment homes, or 81.2% of our portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes, utilities expense, and personnel costs. for the year ended december 31, 2015 , the operating partnership's same-store noi increased by $8.2 million compared to the prior year. our same-store community properties provided 81.9% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2015 . the increase in noi for the 14,760 same-store apartment homes, or 87.0% of the operating partnership's portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates, fee and reimbursement income, increased occupancy, and an decrease in operating expenses. revenue growth in 2016 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents. tax matters udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, udr must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. provided we maintain our qualification as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary ( trs ) to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. however, any state or 8 local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level. inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, property taxes, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of 14 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2015 . environmental matters various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. to date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. we have a property management plan for hazardous materials. as part of the plan, phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. in addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. in some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. we do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. in addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. we are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. 9 available information both udr and the

affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership. the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr's stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms; the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; declines in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire. when our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or 10 reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. if residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase. substantial international, national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. the values of, and the cash flows from, the properties we own are affected by developments in global, national and local economies. as a result of the most recent recession and the significant government interventions, federal, state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities. these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal, state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending, tax increases, public sector job losses, increased interest rates, currency devaluations or other adverse economic events, which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities: a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the debt used to finance the acquisition; even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; 11 we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete; when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; the expected occupancy rates and rental rates may differ from actual results; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all, which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected; if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. in some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance. we have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities. as a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided, projects not being completed on time, or on budget, or at all, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties' ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 12 property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. we currently have 16 active joint ventures and partnerships, including our participating loan investment and preferred equity investment, with a total equity investment of $938.9 million . we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. also, our joint venture partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. in general, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners' interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner's interest in the joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm's length marketing process. we are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our joint venture partner, including (i) a deadlock if we and our joint venture partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the joint venture without the consent of the other joint venture partner, and (iii) the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture. we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs. in connection with certain property acquisitions, we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers, and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions. these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance. we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily industry. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions. as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which are generally outside of our control. we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. in addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; inability to hire and retain key personnel; lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and 13 inability to achieve budgeted financial results. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations. as the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. for example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or acm. environmental, health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. these requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if acm would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. in addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment. we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time, claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from 14 compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change. certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas. should the impact of such climate change be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. risk of earthquake damage. some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. as a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management's view, economically impractical. risk of accidental death due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards. the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. we may acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. as a result, we may not recover some of or all our initial expenditure. in addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the market price of 15 udr ' common stock. a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ( gaap ), if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of udr's common stock. any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ' stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr's stock price. our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or breaches in data security. despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and keeping of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems' improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber attacks. security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us. our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by new federal laws and regulations. the united states administration and congress have enacted, or called for consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues, including with respect to health care, financial regulation reform, climate change, executive compensation and others. we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material. at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us. federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the most recent economic recession. these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression. the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21, 2010 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd-frank act ). many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and continue to require rulemaking by regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. the dodd-frank act, including rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable. changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular, including certain provisions of the dodd-frank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the u.s. public markets. because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting, corporate 16 governance and public disclosure, our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. we may be adversely affected by new state and local laws and regulations. we are subject to state and local laws, regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. we cannot predict what matters might be considered in the future by these state and local authorities, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of new legislation might have on our business. changes in u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap, which is established by the financial accounting standards board (the fasb ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the fasb and the sec, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for u.s. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. risks related to our indebtedness and financings insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr's distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr's stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants' perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; competition from other apartment communities; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing. 17 expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. our debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. moody's and standard &amp; poor's, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt and preferred stock. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ' stock. our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it, the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably. those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing. any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr's common stock. if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr's common or preferred stock. a change in u.s. government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business. fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate. we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans. in september 2008, the u.s. government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency. the administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the u.s. that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets. uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 18 changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2015 , udr had approximately $610.4 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 17.0% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. as of december 31, 2015 , the operating partnership had approximately $197.2 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 41.2% of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of udr's common and preferred stock and debt securities. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr's stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr's stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr's stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr's stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code, and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year. dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. in general, the maximum u.s. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual u.s. stockholders is 20%. unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit, our distributions to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite udr's qualification as a reit, its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our 19 taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm's length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, udr is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to udr's stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr's ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws. as discussed in the risk factors above, because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr's stockholders. in the normal course of business, entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits. if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships, but cannot guarantee that they will qualify. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes, and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes. if classified as partnerships, the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability. however, the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were publicly traded partnerships, unless at least 90% of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code. a publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). although neither the operating partnership's nor the downreit partnership's partnership units are traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption rights of their limited partners, the operating partnership's and downreit partnership's units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the safe harbors under the applicable tax regulations. qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. if the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, they would incur substantial tax liabilities, and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code. our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification. moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or 20 impossible for us to qualify as a reit. our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. in addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. risks related to our organization and ownership of udr's stock changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ' common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange ( nyse ), on which we list udr's common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of udr's common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in udr's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. in addition to the risks listed in this risk factors section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr's common stock, including: general market and economic conditions; actual or anticipated variations in udr's quarterly operating results or dividends or udr's payment of dividends in shares of udr's stock; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt; decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of udr's stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; a change in analyst ratings; additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; speculation in the press or investment community; terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which udr's securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; failure to qualify as a reit; strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; failure to satisfy listing requirements of the nyse; governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and the issuance of additional shares of udr's common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under udr's at-the-market equity distribution program. 21 many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr's common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. we may change the dividend policy for udr ' common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr's common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr's common stock. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in udr ' stockholders ' best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in udr's stockholders' best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr's stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors' prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ' stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ' stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ' stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr's stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of udr's stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr's stockholders or might otherwise be in udr's stockholders' best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 66 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is

redevelops, disposes of and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets throughout the united states. the high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. at december 31, 2016 , our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127 communities located in 18 markets, with a total of 39,454 completed apartment homes, which are held directly or through our subsidiaries, including the operating partnership and the downreit partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. in addition, we have an ownership interest in 27 communities containing 6,849 apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships. as of december 31, 2016 , the company was developing two wholly-owned communities with 1,101 apartment homes, none of which have been completed, and four unconsolidated joint venture communities with 1,069 apartment homes, 99 of which have been completed. at december 31, 2016 , the operating partnership's consolidated real estate portfolio included 54 communities located in 14 markets, with a total of 16,698 completed apartment homes. the operating partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the united states. during the year ended december 31, 2016 , revenues of the operating partnership represented approximately 43% of our total rental revenues. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this report as the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. in 2016 , we declared total distributions of $1.18 per common share and paid dividends of $1.1625 per common share. dividends declared in 2016 dividends paid in 2016 first quarter $ 0.2950 $ 0.2775 second quarter 0.2950 0.2950 third quarter 0.2950 0.2950 fourth quarter 0.2950 0.2950 total $ 1.1800 $ 1.1625 udr was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation. in june 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland. the operating partnership is the successor-in-interest to united dominion realty, l.p., a limited partnership formed under the laws of virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. the operating partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a delaware limited partnership. our corporate offices are located at 1745 shea center drive, suite 200, highlands ranch, colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. our website is www.udr.com . the information contained on our website, including any information referred to in this report as being available on our website, is not a part of or incorporated into this report. as of february 17, 2017 , we had 1,550 full-time associates and 37 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by udr. reporting segments we report in two segments: same-store communities and non-mature communities/other . our ame-store communities segment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2015 , and held as of december 31, 2016 . these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for disposition at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. 3 our non-mature communities/other segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. for additional information regarding our operating segments, see note 16, reportable

statements included in this report. business objectives our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. to achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies: own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities; empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively; measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of liquidity, earnings and dividends. 2016 highlights in july 2016, the company marked its 44th year as a reit and, in october 2016, paid its 176th consecutive quarterly dividend. the company's annualized declared 2016 dividend of $1.18 represented a 6.3% increase over the previous year. we achieved same-store revenue growth of 5.7% and same-store net operating income ( noi ) growth of 6.5% . we completed two developments held by unconsolidated joint ventures in san francisco, ca and los angeles, ca with a total of 637 apartment homes. we completed four developments held by the west coast development joint venture located in seattle, wa, los angeles, ca and anaheim, ca with a total of 1,147 apartment homes. we completed three redevelopment projects in bellevue, wa, newport beach, ca and san francisco, ca. as of december 31, 2016, we were developing two wholly-owned communities and four communities held by unconsolidated joint ventures and redeveloping three wholly-owned communities. we acquired a community in redmond, wa with 177 apartment homes, increased our ownership from 50% to 100% in two operating communities located in bellevue, wa with a total of 331 apartment homes and increased our ownership interest in two parcels of land located in dublin, ca and los angeles, ca for a total of approximately $207.3 million , including the assumption of an incremental $37.9 million of secured debt. a portion of these acquisitions was funded with tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 ( section 1031 exchanges ). we recognized gains on the sale of real estate of $210.9 million from the sale of seven communities in baltimore, md and one community in dallas, tx with a total of 1,782 apartment homes, a retail center in bellevue, wa and two parcels of land in santa monica, ca. a portion of the sale proceeds was designated for tax-deferred section 1031 exchanges for certain acquisitions in 2016. in march 2016, we issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock through a public offering for net proceeds of approximately $173.2 million . in august 2016, we issued $300 million of 2.95%, 10-year senior unsecured medium-term notes. refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for further information on the company's and the operating partnership's activities in 2016 . 4 our strategies and vision our vision is to be the innovative multifamily public reit of choice. our strategic priorities are: 1. strengthen the quality of our diversified portfolio 2. flexible/strong balance sheet 3. increase cash flow to support dividend growth through operating excellence 4. a great place to work and live quality of our diversified portfolio we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research. acquisitions and dispositions when evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider: whether it is located in a high barrier-to-entry market; population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located; geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; construction quality, condition and design of the property; current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; the ability of the property's projected cash flows to exceed our cost of capital; potential for capital appreciation of the property; ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include: current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset; potential increases in new construction in the market area; areas with low job growth prospects; markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and operating efficiencies. the

downreit partnership. development activities our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio. demographic trends, economic drivers, and how multifamily fundamentals/valuations have trended over the long-term govern our review process on where to allocate development capital. at december 31, 2016 , our development pipeline included two wholly-owned communities located in huntington beach, california and boston, massachusetts with 1,101 homes and a budget of $708.5 million , in which we have a carrying value of $342.3 million . redevelopment activities our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. during 2016 , we continued to redevelop properties in primary markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. at december 31, 2016 , the company was redeveloping 425 apartment homes, 351 of which have been completed, at three wholly-owned communities located in san francisco, california, austin, texas, and dallas, texas. during the year ended december 31, 2016 , we incurred $21.3 million in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. joint venture and partnership activities we have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement. balance sheet management we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate. financing activities as part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities. operational excellence, cash flow and dividend growth investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our web-based resident internet portal. 6 as a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents' satisfaction improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes. operating partnership strategies and vision the operating partnership's long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology. as a result, the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in new york, new york; san francisco bay area, california; boston, massachusetts; and metropolitan d.c. over the past years. prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns. markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth, household income, low single-family home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing, which are key drivers to strong rental growth. competitive conditions competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors, including sub-market supply and demand. in addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do. we believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. we believe our competitive advantages include: a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts; access to sources of capital; geographic diversification with a presence in 18 markets across the country; and significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. we believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio's strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside. communities at december 31, 2016 , our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127 communities with a total of 39,454 completed apartment homes, which included the operating partnership's consolidated real estate portfolio of 54 communities with a total of 16,698 completed apartment homes. the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents. at december 31, 2016 , the company was developing two wholly-owned communities with 1,101 apartment homes, none of which have been completed. the communities being developed are not part of the operating partnership's real estate portfolio. at december 31, 2016 , the company was redeveloping 425 apartment homes, 351 of which have been completed, at three wholly-owned communities. one of these communities under redevelopment is held by the operating partnership. same-store community comparison we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same-store communities' noi, which is total rental revenue, less rental and other operating expenses excluding property 7 management. our same-store community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. for the year ended december 31, 2016 , our same-store noi increase d by $31.4 million compared to the prior year. our same-store community properties provided 76.9% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2016 . the increase in noi for the 31,930 same-store apartment homes, or 80.9% of our portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes. for the year ended december 31, 2016 , the operating partnership's same-store noi increased by $15.8 million compared to the prior year. the operating partnership's same-store community properties provided 79.9% of its total noi for the year ended december 31, 2016 . the increase in noi for the 14,001 same-store apartment homes, or 83.8% of the operating partnership's portfolio, was driven by an increase in rental rates and a decrease in operating expenses. revenue growth in 2017 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents. tax matters udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, udr must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. provided we maintain our qualification as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary ( trs ) to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. however, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level. inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, property taxes, utilities and material costs, the majority of our apartment leases have terms of 12 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2016 . environmental matters various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. to date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. we have a property management plan for hazardous materials. as part of the plan, phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. in addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. in some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks 8 involved. we do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. in addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. we are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. available information both udr and the operating partnership file

results of operations of the company and the operating partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership. the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr's stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the global, national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives with respect to home ownership, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms; the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; declines in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire, or the terms of renewals or new leases may be less favorable than current leases. when our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. furthermore, because the majority of our apartment leases have terms of 12 months or less, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. if residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase. 10 we face certain risks related to our retail and commercial space. certain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties. the long term nature of our retail and commercial leases (generally five to ten years with market based renewal options) and the characteristics of many of our tenants (generally small and/or local businesses) may subject us to certain risks. the longer term leases could result in below market lease rates over time if we do not accurately judge the potential increases in market rental rates. we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates. also, when leases for our retail or commercial space expire, the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the prior lease terms. our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space. the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. if our retail or commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy, they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities, among others: a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks, among others: we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the debt used to finance the acquisition; even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may not complete the acquisition for a variety of reasons after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete; 11 when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; the expected occupancy rates and rental rates may differ from actual results; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks, among others: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all, which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected; if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. in some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance. we have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities. as a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided, projects not being completed on time, or on budget, or at all, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties' ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 12 property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. we currently have 16 active joint ventures and partnerships, including our participating loan investment and preferred equity investment, with a total equity investment of $827.0 million . we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, our partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. also, our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. in general, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners' interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner's interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm's length marketing process. we are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our partner, including (i) a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner, and (iii) the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture. we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs. in connection with certain property acquisitions, we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers, and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions. these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance. however, subject to certain conditions, we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers. we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily industry. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions. as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which are generally outside of our control. we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. in addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; inability to hire and retain key personnel; 13 lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and inability to achieve budgeted financial results. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations. as the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. for example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or acm. environmental, health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. these requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if acm would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. in addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment. we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time, claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. 14 compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. we are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. generally, we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws and regulations regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change. certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas. should the impact of such climate change be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. risk of earthquake damage. some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. as a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management's view, economically impractical. risk of accidental death due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards. the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. we may acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. as a result, we may not recover some of or all our 15 initial expenditure. in addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. risk related to preferred equity investments. in the future we may make preferred equity investments in corporations, limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing or managing real property. with preferred equity investments, our interest in a particular entity will be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity. generally, we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity, and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors, managers, general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations. although we would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives, the owner of the majority of the voting interests may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent or that are inconsistent with our interests. further, if the owner of the majority of the voting interests were to fail to invest capital in the entity, we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment. the owner of the majority of the voting interests may fail to develop or operate the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner if at all. in addition, we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest. in the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations or becomes insolvent, we may lose our entire investment in the entity. we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ' common stock. a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ( gaap ), if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of udr's common stock. any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ' stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr's stock price. our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or breaches in data security. despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems and systems maintained by third party vendors are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet and networks and systems maintained and controlled by third party vendors, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and keeping of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. although we take steps, and generally require third party vendors to take steps, to protect the security of the data maintained in our and their information systems, it is possible that our or their security measures will not be able to prevent the systems' improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber attacks. security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our or third party vendors' information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us. social media presents risks. the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure. negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation. further, employees or others may disclose non-public information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. as social media evolves we will be presented with new and risks and challenges. 16 our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. changes in u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap, which is established by the financial accounting standards board (the fasb ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the fasb and the sec, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for u.s. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. risks related to our indebtedness and financings insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr's distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr's stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants' perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; competition from other apartment communities; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing. expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. 17 changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt, including commercial paper, at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2016 , udr had approximately $432.0 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 12.7% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. as of december 31, 2016 , the operating partnership had approximately $190.6 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 43.8% of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. in addition, borrowings under our commercial paper program bear interest at variable rates. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt, including commercial paper. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of udr's common and preferred stock and debt securities. our debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit, construction loans and other forms of secured debt, commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time, including due to regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets, for example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the basel iii capital requirements and the associated high volatility commercial real estate designation, which has adversely impacted the availability of loans, including construction loans and the interest rate thereon. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. moody's and standard &amp; poor's routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt, commercial paper program and preferred stock. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets, including our ability to access the commercial paper market. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ' stock. our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it, the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably. those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing, such as the commercial paper market. any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr's common stock. if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr's common or preferred stock. a change in u.s. government policy or support regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business. while in recent years we have decreased our borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac, fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing market including potential purchasers of our properties. potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the u.s. have been suggested, including options that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing fannie mae and freddie mac are able to 18 provide, limitations on the loans that the agencies may make, which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties, or the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally, it may adversely affect interest rates, capital availability, development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and, as a result, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr's stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr's stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr's stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr's stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code, and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year. dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. in general, the maximum u.s. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual u.s. stockholders is 20%. unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit, our distributions to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite udr's qualification as a reit, its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do 19 not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm's length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, udr is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to udr's stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr's ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws, including the enactment of certain proposed tax reform measures, could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws are proposed regularly. legislative and regulatory changes may be more likely in the 115 th congress because the presidency and such congress will be controlled by the same political party and significant reform of the code has been described publicly as a legislative priority. additionally, the reit rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the u.s. treasury department, which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes. if enacted, certain such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. for example, certain proposals set forth in president trump's administration and house republican tax plans could reduce the relative competitive advantage of operating as a reit unless accompanied by responsive changes to the reit rules. these proposals include: the lowering of income tax rates on individuals and corporations, which could ease the burden of double taxation on corporate dividends and make the single level of taxation on reit distributions relatively less attractive; allowing the expensing of capital expenditures, which could result in the bunching of taxable income and required distributions for reits; and further limiting or eliminating the deductibility of interest expense, which could disrupt the real estate market and could increase the amount of reit taxable income that must be distributed as dividends to shareholders. we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new u.s. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be issued, nor is the long-term impact of proposed tax reforms on the real estate investment industry or reits clear. prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential changes to the u.s. federal tax laws on an investment in our shares. we may be adversely affected by changes in state and local tax laws and may become subject to tax audits from time to time. as discussed in the risk factors above, because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr's stockholders. in the normal course of business, we or our affiliates (including entities through which we own real estate) may also become subject to federal, state or local tax audits. if we (or such entities) become subject to federal, state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 20 the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships, but cannot guarantee that they will qualify. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes, and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes. if classified as partnerships, the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability. however, the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were publicly traded partnerships, unless at least 90% of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code. a publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). although neither the operating partnership's nor the downreit partnership's partnership units are traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption rights of their limited partners, the operating partnership's and downreit partnership's units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the safe harbors under the applicable tax regulations. qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. if the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, they would incur substantial tax liabilities, and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code. our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification. moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit. our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. in addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. risks related to our organization and ownership of udr's stock changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ' common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange ( nyse ), on which we list udr's common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of udr's common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in udr's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. in addition to the risks listed in this risk factors section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr's common stock, including: general market and economic conditions; actual or anticipated variations in udr's quarterly operating results or dividends or udr's payment of dividends in shares of udr's stock; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt; decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); 21 general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of udr's stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; a change in analyst ratings; additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; speculation in the press or investment community; terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which udr's securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; failure to qualify as a reit; strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; failure to satisfy listing requirements of the nyse; governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and the issuance of additional shares of udr's common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under udr's at-the-market equity distribution program. many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr's common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. we may change the dividend policy for udr ' common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr's common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr's common stock. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in udr ' stockholders ' best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in udr's stockholders' best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr's stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors' prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ' stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ' stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ' stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr's stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of udr's stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of 22 such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr's stockholders or might otherwise be in udr's stockholders' best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 64 quantitative and qualitative

self-administered real estate investment trust, or reit, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, disposes of, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets throughout the united states. the high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. at december 31, 2017, our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127 communities located in 19 markets, with a total of 39,998 completed apartment homes, which are held directly or through our subsidiaries, including the operating partnership and the downreit partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. in addition, we have an ownership interest in 29 communities containing 7,286 apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships. as of december 31, 2017, the company was developing two wholly-owned communities with 1,101 apartment homes, 300 of which have been completed, and two unconsolidated joint venture communities with 533 apartment homes, none of which have been completed. at december 31, 2017, the operating partnership consolidated real estate portfolio included 53 communities located in 15 markets, with a total of 16,698 completed apartment homes. the operating partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the united states. during the year ended december 31, 2017, revenues of the operating partnership represented approximately 43% of our total rental revenues. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this report as the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. in 2017, we declared total distributions of $1.24 per common share and paid dividends of $1.225 per common share. dividends dividends declared in paid in 2017 2017 first quarter $ 0.310 $ 0.295 second quarter 0.310 0.310 third quarter 0.310 0.310 fourth quarter 0.310 0.310 total $ 1.240 $ 1.225 udr was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation. in june 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland. the operating partnership is the successor-in-interest to united dominion realty, l.p., a limited partnership formed under the laws of virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. the operating partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a delaware limited partnership. our corporate offices are located at 1745 shea center drive, suite 200, highlands ranch, colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283 6120. our website is www.udr.com . the information contained on our website, including any information referred to in this report as being available on our website, is not a part of or incorporated into this report. as of february 16, 2018, we had 1,502 full-time associates and 40 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by udr. reporting segments we report in two segments: same-store communities and non-mature communities/other . our ame-store communities segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2016, and held as of december 31, 2017. these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. 3 table of contents our non-mature communities/other segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. for additional information regarding our operating segments, see note 15, reportable segments , in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report and note 11, reportable segments , in the notes to the operating partnership consolidated financial statements included in this report. business objectives our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. to achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies: own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities; empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively; measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of liquidity, earnings and dividends. 2017 highlights in july 2017, the company marked its 45th year as a reit and, in october 2017, paid its 180th consecutive quarterly dividend. the company annualized declared 2017 dividend of $1.24 represented a 5.1% increase over the previous year. we achieved same-store revenue growth of 3.7% and same-store net operating income ( noi ) growth of 3.8%. we completed two developments held by unconsolidated joint ventures in irvine, ca and mountain view, ca with a total of 536 apartment homes. we completed three redevelopment projects in san francisco, ca, austin, tx and dallas, tx. as of december 31, 2017, we were developing two wholly-owned communities and two communities held by unconsolidated joint ventures. we acquired a community in denver, co with 218 apartment homes and increased our ownership from 49% to 100% in an operating community located in seattle, wa with 244 apartment homes for a total of approximately $207.5 million. the acquisition in denver, co will be fully or partially funded with tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986. we recognized gains on the sale of real estate of $43.4 million from the sale of two communities in orange county, ca and carlsbad, ca with a total of 218 apartment homes and a parcel of land in richmond, va. we recognized gains of $7.6 million as a result of the sale of two communities in seattle, wa and anaheim, ca by the west coast development joint venture. we contributed $87.5 million to five unconsolidated investments under our developer capital program, which earn preferred returns ranging between 6.5% to 11.0%. 4 table of contents we issued $600 million of 3.50%, 10-year senior unsecured medium-term notes and redeemed $300 million of 4.25% unsecured medium-term notes due june 2018. we prepaid $275.3 million of our secured credit facilities with borrowings under the unsecured commercial paper program and proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured medium-term notes. we entered into an unsecured commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $500 million. refer to item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for further information on the company and the operating partnership activities in 2017. our strategic vision our strategic vision is to be the innovative multifamily public reit of choice. we intend to realize this vision by executing on our strategic objectives, which are: 1. maintaining a diversified portfolio and allocating capital to accretive investment opportunities 2. maintaining a strong balance sheet 3. consistently driving operating excellence 4. advancing a strong corporate culture and ensuring high resident satisfaction maintaining a diversified portfolio and allocating capital to accretive investment opportunities we believe greater portfolio diversification, as defined by geographic concentration, location within a market (i.e., urban or suburban) and property quality (i.e., a or b), reduces the volatility of our same-store growth throughout the real estate cycle, appeals to a wider renter and investor audience and lessens the market risk associated with owning a homogenous portfolio. diversified characteristics of our portfolio include: our consolidated apartment portfolio includes 127 communities located in 19 markets throughout the u.s., including both coastal and sunbelt locations; and our mix of urban/suburban communities and our mix of a/b quality properties is approximately 50%/50%. we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research. acquisitions and dispositions when evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider a wide variety of factors, including: whether it is located in a high barrier-to-entry market; population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located; geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; construction quality, condition and design of the property; current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; ability of the property projected cash flows to exceed our cost of capital; potential for capital appreciation of the property; ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; 5 table of contents terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include: current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset; potential increases in new construction in the market area; areas with low job growth prospects; markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and operating efficiencies. the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated year-end ownership position for the past five years ( dollars in thousands ): 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 homes

development activities our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio. demographic trends, economic drivers, and how multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the long-term generally govern our review process on where to allocate development capital. at december 31, 2017, our development pipeline included two wholly-owned communities located in huntington beach, california and boston, massachusetts with a total of 1,101 homes and an aggregate budget of $716.5 million, in which we have a total carrying value of $592.5 million. redevelopment activities our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. during 2017, we continued to redevelop properties in primary markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we incurred $15.4 million in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. at december 31, 2017, the company was not redeveloping any communities. 6 table of contents joint venture and partnership activities we have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement. maintaining a strong balance sheet we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate. financing activities as part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities. consistently driving operational excellence investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our web-based resident internet portal. as a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents satisfaction has improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes. operating partnership strategies and vision the operating partnership long-term strategic vision is the same as that of the company as described above. competitive conditions competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors, including sub-market supply and demand. in addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do. we believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. we believe our competitive advantages include: a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts; 7 table of contents access to sources of capital; geographic diversification with a presence in 19 markets across the country; and significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. we believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside. communities at december 31, 2017, our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127 communities with a total of 39,998 completed apartment homes, which included the operating partnership consolidated real estate portfolio of 53 communities with a total of 16,698 completed apartment homes. the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents. at december 31, 2017, the company was developing two wholly-owned communities with 1,101 apartment homes, 300 of which have been completed. the communities being developed are not part of the operating partnership real estate portfolio. at december 31, 2017, the company was not redeveloping any communities. same-store community comparison we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same-store communities noi, which is total rental revenue, less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management. our same-store community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. for the year ended december 31, 2017, our same-store noi increased by $22.0 million compared to the prior year. our same-store community properties provided 87.0% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in noi for the 35,471 same-store apartment homes, or 88.7% of our portfolio, was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the operating partnership same-store noi increased by $10.7 million compared to the prior year. the operating partnership same-store community properties provided 87.2% of its total noi for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in noi for the 14,840 same-store apartment homes, or 88.9% of the operating partnership portfolio, was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes. revenue growth in 2018 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents. tax matters udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, udr must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. provided we maintain our qualification as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary ( trs ) to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain 8 table of contents nonqualifying real estate transactions. our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. however, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level. inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs, the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2017. environmental matters various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. to date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. we have a property management plan for hazardous materials. as part of the plan, phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. in addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. in some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. we do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. in addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. 9 table of contents insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. we are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. available information both udr and the operating partnership file electronically with the

results of operations of the company and the operating partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership. the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the global, national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives with respect to home ownership, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms; the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; declines in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire, or the terms of renewals or new leases may be less favorable than current leases. when our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. furthermore, because the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. if residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase. 11 table of contents we face certain risks related to our retail and commercial space. certain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties. the long term nature of our retail and commercial leases (generally five to ten years with market based renewal options) and the characteristics of many of our tenants (generally small and/or local businesses) may subject us to certain risks. the longer term leases could result in below market lease rates over time. we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates. also, when leases for our retail or commercial space expire, the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the prior lease terms. our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space. the presence of competitive alternatives may adversely affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. if our retail or commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy, they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr stockholders. we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities, among others: a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks, among others: we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, term and/or loan-to-value ratios, or at all, all of which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential acquisitions; even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the debt used to finance the acquisition; even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may not complete the acquisition for a variety of reasons after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; 12 table of contents we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete; when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; the expected occupancy rates and rental rates may differ from actual results; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could materially adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to acquire attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could materially adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks, among others: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities on favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, term and/or loan to value ratios, or at all, which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such development opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; occupancy rates, rents and concessions at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our expected return on our investment and our overall profitability goals; and when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance. we have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities. as a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided, projects not being completed on time, or on budget, or at all, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 13 table of contents property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. as of december 31, 2017, we had active joint ventures and partnerships, including our participating loan investment and preferred equity investments, with a total equity investment of $720.8 million. we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, our partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. also, our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. in general, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm length marketing process. we are also subject to other risks in connection with partnerships or joint ventures, including (i) a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner, and (iii) the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture. we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs. in connection with certain property acquisitions, we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers, and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions. these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance. however, subject to certain conditions, we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers. we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily industry. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions. as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a component of expense. insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which are generally outside of our control. we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. the financial condition of one or more insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. in addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew or replace our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring properties. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; 14 table of contents inability to hire and retain key personnel; lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and inability to achieve budgeted financial results. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations. as the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. for example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or acm. environmental, health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. these requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if acm would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. in addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment. we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time, claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or 15 table of contents more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. we are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances at locations where we operate regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. generally, we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws and regulations regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or unanticipated reductions in revenue, which could adversely affect our funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change. our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas. should the impact of such climate change be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. risk of earthquake damage. some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of earthquake faults. we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. as a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management view, economically impractical. risk of accidental death or injury due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards. the accidental death or injury of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 16 table of contents mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. we may originate mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than a senior mortgage secured by real property, because the security for the loan may lose all or substantially all of its value as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. as a result, we may not recover some of or all our investment. in addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. risk related to preferred equity investments. we may make preferred equity investments in corporations, limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing or managing real property. with preferred equity investments, our interest in a particular entity will be less than a majority of the outstanding ownership interests of that entity. generally, we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity, and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors, managers, general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations. although we would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives, our partners may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent or that are inconsistent with our interests. further, if our partners were to fail to invest capital in the entity, we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment. our partners may fail to develop or operate the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner if at all. in addition, we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest. in the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations or becomes insolvent, we may lose our entire investment in the entity. we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr common stock. a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ( gaap ), if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of udr common stock. any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of udr common stock. a breach of information technology systems on which we rely could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. we rely on information technology systems, including the internet and networks and systems maintained and controlled by third party vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes. third party vendors collect and hold personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our tenants, prospective tenants and employees. we also maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons and entities with which we do business on our information technology systems. while we take steps, and generally require third party vendors to take steps, to protect the security of the information maintained in our and third party vendors information technology systems, including the use of commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide 17 table of contents security for processing, transmitting and storing of the information, it is possible that our or our third party vendors security measures will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning, or the loss, misappropriation, disclosure or corruption of personally identifiable information or other confidential or sensitive information, including information about our tenants and employees. cybersecurity breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized access to information maintained on our information technology systems or the information technology systems of our third party vendors or other third parties. while we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cybersecurity breaches, there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cybersecurity breach. as the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems become more varied and sophisticated and the occurrence of such breaches becomes more frequent, we and our third party vendors and other third parties may be unable to adequately anticipate these techniques or breaches and implement appropriate preventative measures. any failure to prevent cybersecurity breaches and maintain the proper function, security and availability of our or our third party vendors and other third parties information technology systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation and brand, damage our competitive position, make it difficult for us to attract and retain tenants, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures. despite system redundancy and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our information technology systems, our information technology systems and the information technology systems maintained by our third party vendors are vulnerable to damage arising from any number of sources beyond our or our third party vendors control, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. any failure to maintain proper function and availability of our or third party vendors information technology systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. social media presents risks. the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure. negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation. further, employees or others may disclose non-public information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. as social media evolves we will be presented with new risks and challenges. our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. changes in u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap, which is established by the financial accounting standards board (the fasb ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the fasb and the sec, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for u.s. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. risks related to our indebtedness and financings insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, the amounts under our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could 18 table of contents create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow, and increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr stockholders. failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient revenue to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the revenue generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; competition from other apartment communities; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing. expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenue from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt, including unsecured commercial paper, at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2017, udr had approximately $480.5 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 13.0% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. as of december 31, 2017, the operating partnership had approximately $27.0 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 16.9% of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt, including unsecured commercial paper. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. our debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit, construction loans and other forms of secured debt, commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time, including due to regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets, for example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the basel iii capital requirements and the associated high volatility commercial real estate designation, which has adversely impacted the availability of 19 table of contents loans, including construction loans, and the proceeds of and the interest rate thereon. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of udr existing stockholders could be diluted. failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. moody and standard &amp; poor s, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt, commercial paper program and preferred stock. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets, including our ability to access the commercial paper market. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr stock. our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it, the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably. those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing, such as the commercial paper market. any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr common stock. if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr common or preferred stock. a change in u.s. government policy or support regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business. while in recent years we have decreased our borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac, fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing market including potential purchasers of our properties. potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the u.s. have been suggested, including options that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing fannie mae and freddie mac are able to provide, limitations on the loans that the agencies may make, which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties, or the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally, it may adversely affect interest rates, capital availability, development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and, as a result, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us 20 table of contents to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including, for periods prior to 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code, and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year. dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. in general, the maximum u.s. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual u.s. stockholders is 20%. unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit, our distributions to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. however, under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, with respect to regular dividends (dividends that are themselves neither capital gain dividends nor qualified dividend income) we pay to our u.s. stockholders that are not corporations, 20% of such dividends may generally be included in the calculation of combined qualified business income for purposes of calculating the deduction available under section 199a of the code (a provision due to expire after 2025, absent future legislation). udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established taxable reit subsidiaries. despite udr qualification as a reit, its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, udr is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to udr stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the 21 table of contents recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws, including the enactment of certain tax reform measures, could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. although the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was recently passed, there can be no assurance that future changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws or regulatory changes will not be proposed or enacted that could impact our business and financial results. the reit rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the u.s. treasury department, which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes. if enacted, certain of such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. moreover, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 contained provisions that may reduce the relative competitive advantage of operating as a reit. for example, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 lowered income tax rates on individuals and corporations, easing the burden of double taxation on corporate dividends and potentially causing the single level of taxation on reit distributions to be relatively less attractive. the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 also contains provisions allowing the expensing of capital expenditures, which could result in the bunching of taxable income and required distributions for reits, and provisions further limiting the deductibility of interest expense, which could disrupt the real estate market. we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and any new u.s. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will impact the real estate investment industry or reits. prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and potential future changes to the federal tax laws on an investment in our shares. we may be adversely affected by changes in state and local tax laws and may become subject to tax audits from time to time. because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and local jurisdictions in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr stockholders. in the normal course of business, we or our affiliates (including entities through which we own real estate) may also become subject to federal, state or local tax audits. if we (or such entities) become subject to federal, state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships, but cannot guarantee that they will qualify. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes, and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes. if classified as partnerships, the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability. however, the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were publicly traded partnerships, unless at least 90% of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code. a publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). although neither the operating partnership nor the downreit partnership partnership units are traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption rights of their limited partners, the operating partnership and downreit partnership units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the operating partnership and the 22 table of contents downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the safe harbors under the applicable tax regulations. qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. if either the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax liabilities, and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code. our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification. moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit. our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. in addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. risks related to our organization and ownership of udr stock changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange ( nyse ), on which we list udr common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of udr common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in udr common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. in addition to the risks listed in this risk factors section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr common stock, including: general market and economic conditions; actual or anticipated variations in udr quarterly operating results or dividends or udr payment of dividends in shares of udr stock; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt; decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of udr stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; a change in analyst ratings; additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; speculation in the press or investment community; terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which udr securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; 23 table of contents failure to qualify as a reit; strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; failure to satisfy listing requirements of the nyse; governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and the issuance of additional shares of udr common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under udr at-the-market equity distribution program. many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. we may change the dividend policy for udr common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr common stock. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in udr stockholders best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in udr stockholders best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of udr stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr stockholders or might otherwise be in udr stockholders best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 64 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in

renovates, develops, redevelops, disposes of, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets throughout the united states. the high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. at december 31, 2018, our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127 communities located in 19 markets, with a total of 39,931 completed apartment homes, which are held directly or through our subsidiaries, including the operating partnership and the downreit partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. in addition, we have an ownership interest in 32 communities containing 8,112 apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships. as of december 31, 2018, no wholly-owned or unconsolidated joint venture communities were under development. at december 31, 2018, the operating partnership consolidated real estate portfolio included 52 communities located in 15 markets, with a total of 16,434 completed apartment homes. the operating partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the united states. during the year ended december 31, 2018, revenues of the operating partnership represented approximately 42% of our total rental revenues. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this report as the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. in 2018, we declared total distributions of $1.29 per common share and paid dividends of $1.2775 per common share. dividends dividends declared in paid in 2018 2018 first quarter $ 0.3225 $ 0.3100 second quarter 0.3225 0.3225 third quarter 0.3225 0.3225 fourth quarter 0.3225 0.3225 total $ 1.2900 $ 1.2775 udr was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation. in june 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland. the operating partnership is the successor-in-interest to united dominion realty, l.p., a limited partnership formed under the laws of virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. the operating partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a delaware limited partnership. our corporate offices are located at 1745 shea center drive, suite 200, highlands ranch, colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283 6120. our website is www.udr.com . the information contained on our website, including any information referred to in this report as being available on our website, is not a part of or incorporated into this report. as of february 18, 2019, we had 1,405 full-time associates and 26 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by udr. reporting segments we report in two segments: same-store communities and non-mature communities/other . our ame-store communities segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2017, and held as of december 31, 2018. these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. 3 table of contents our non-mature communities/other segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. for additional information regarding our operating segments, see note 15, reportable segments , in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report and note 11, reportable segments , in the notes to the operating partnership consolidated financial statements included in this report. business objectives our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. to achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies: own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities; empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively; measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of liquidity, earnings and dividends. 2018 highlights in july 2018, the company marked its 46th year as a reit and, in october 2018, paid its 184th consecutive quarterly dividend. the company annualized declared 2018 dividend of $1.29 represented a 4.0% increase over the previous year. total revenues increased 5.1% and net income attributable to common stockholders increased 69.1% over the prior year. we achieved same-store revenue growth of 3.5% and same-store net operating income ( noi ) growth of 3.4%. we completed the development of two wholly-owned communities, located in huntington beach, california and boston, massachusetts, with a total of 1,101 apartment homes. we completed the development of two communities held by unconsolidated joint ventures, located in los angeles, california and addison, texas, with a total of 533 apartment homes. we recognized gains on the sale of real estate of $136.2 million from the sale of two communities in huntington beach, california and fairfax, virginia with a total of 868 apartment homes. we contributed $120.7 million to seven unconsolidated investments under our developer capital program, which earn preferred returns ranging between 8.0% to 12.5%. we issued $300.0 million of 4.40% (4.27% effective rate after the effect of a cash flow hedge) 10-year senior unsecured medium-term notes. we prepaid $224.8 million of our secured credit facility and $50.1 million of fixed rate mortgage debt with proceeds from the refinance of a mortgage note payable and proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured medium-term notes. 4 table of contents we extended the maturity and lowered the rates on our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility and $350 million term loan facility. we repurchased 593,373 shares of common stock at a weighted average price per share of $33.69, for total consideration of approximately $20.0 million. we sold 7,150,000 shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $299.8 million at a price per share of $41.98. thomas w. toomey was named chairman of the board, in addition to his responsibilities as chief executive officer. refer to item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for further information on the company and the operating partnership activities in 2018. our strategic vision our strategic vision is to be the multifamily public reit of choice. we intend to realize this vision by executing on our strategic objectives, which are: 1. maintaining a diversified portfolio and allocating capital to accretive investment opportunities 2. maintaining a strong balance sheet 3. consistently driving operating excellence 4. advancing a strong corporate culture and ensuring high resident satisfaction maintaining a diversified portfolio and allocating capital to accretive investment opportunities we believe greater portfolio diversification, as defined by geographic concentration, location within a market (i.e., urban or suburban) and property quality (i.e., a or b), reduces the volatility of our same-store growth throughout the real estate cycle, appeals to a wider renter and investor audience and lessens the market risk associated with owning a homogenous portfolio. diversified characteristics of our portfolio include: our consolidated apartment portfolio includes 127 communities located in 19 markets throughout the u.s., including both coastal and sunbelt locations; and our mix of urban/suburban communities and our mix of a/b quality properties is approximately 50%/50%. we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research. acquisitions and dispositions when evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider a wide variety of factors, including: whether it is located in a high barrier-to-entry market; population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located; geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; construction quality, condition and design of the property; current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; ability of the property projected cash flows to exceed our cost of capital; potential for capital appreciation of the property; 5 table of contents ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include: current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset; potential increases in new construction in the market area; areas with low job growth prospects; markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and operating efficiencies. the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated

deconsolidated in 2015 upon contribution of communities by the operating partnership to the downreit partnership. development activities our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio. demographic trends, economic drivers, and how multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the long-term generally govern our review process on where to allocate development capital. at december 31, 2018, no communities were under development. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we completed the development of two wholly-owned communities, located in huntington beach, california and boston, massachusetts, with a total of 1,101 homes. redevelopment activities our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we incurred $22.8 million in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. as of december 31, 2018, no communities were under redevelopment. 6 table of contents joint venture and partnership activities we have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement. maintaining a strong balance sheet we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate. financing activities as part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities. consistently driving operational excellence investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents. our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our web-based resident internet portal. as a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents satisfaction has improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes. operating partnership strategies and vision the operating partnership long-term strategic vision is the same as that of the company as described above. competitive conditions competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors, including sub-market supply and demand. in addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do. we believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. we believe our competitive advantages include: a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts; 7 table of contents access to sources of capital; geographic diversification with a presence in 19 markets across the country; and significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance. we believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside. communities at december 31, 2018, our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127 communities with a total of 39,931 completed apartment homes, which included the operating partnership consolidated real estate portfolio of 52 communities with a total of 16,434 completed apartment homes. the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents. at december 31, 2018, no communities were under development or redevelopment. same-store community comparison we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same-store communities noi, which is total rental revenue, less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management. our same-store community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. net income attributable to common stockholders was $199.2 million as compared to $117.9 million in the prior year period. the increase was primarily driven by higher operating income, including gains on the sale of real estate. for the year ended december 31, 2018, our same-store noi increased by $22.0 million compared to the prior year. our same-store community properties provided 91.8% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in noi for the 37,673 same-store apartment homes, or 94.3% of our portfolio, was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates and reimbursements and ancillary and fee income, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes. for the year ended december 31, 2018, the operating partnership same-store noi increased by $12.5 million compared to the prior year. the operating partnership same-store community properties provided 96.0% of its total noi for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in noi for the 16,216 same-store apartment homes, or 98.7% of the operating partnership portfolio, was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates and reimbursements and ancillary and fee income, partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes. revenue growth in 2019 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents. tax matters udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, udr must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. provided we maintain our qualification as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary ( trs ) to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes. 8 table of contents the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. however, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level. inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs, the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2018. environmental matters various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. to date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. we have a property management plan for hazardous materials. as part of the plan, phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. in addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. in some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. we do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. in addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. we are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical 9 table of contents damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. available information both udr and the operating partnership file electronically

the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership. the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate or unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, housing markets, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the global, national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives with respect to home ownership, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms; the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; declines in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. the geographic concentration of our communities in certain markets could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely impacted by economic or other conditions. for the year ended december 31, 2018, approximately 52.3% of our total noi was generated from communities located in the washington, d.c. metropolitan area (17.0%), orange county, ca (12.8%), the san francisco bay area, ca (12.2%) and new york, ny (10.3%). as a result, if any one or more of these markets is adversely impacted by regional or local economic conditions or local real estate market conditions or regulations, such conditions may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse. we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire, or the terms of renewals or new leases may be less favorable than current leases. when our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet 11 table of contents their apartment units. even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. furthermore, because the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. if residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase. we face certain risks related to our retail and commercial space. certain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties. the long term nature of our retail and commercial leases (generally five to ten years with market based renewal options) and the characteristics of many of our tenants (generally small and/or local businesses) may subject us to certain risks. the longer term leases could result in below market lease rates over time. we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates. also, when leases for our retail or commercial space expire, the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the prior lease terms. our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space. the presence of competitive alternatives may adversely affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. if our retail or commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy, they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio in order to meet our strategic objectives, which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or our ability to fund other activities in which we may want to engage such as the purchase of properties, development or redevelopment or funding the developer capital program. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities, among others: a significant portion of the proceeds from property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities 12 table of contents that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks, among others: we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, term and/or loan-to-value ratios, or at all, all of which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential acquisitions; even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the debt used to finance the acquisition; even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may not complete the acquisition for a variety of reasons after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we subsequently do not complete; when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; the expected occupancy rates and rental rates may differ from actual results; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could materially adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to acquire attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks, among others: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities on favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, term and/or loan to value ratios, or at all, which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental or quasi-governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; cost may be higher or yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such development opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; occupancy rates, rents and concessions at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our expected return on our investment and our overall profitability goals; and 13 table of contents when we sell communities or properties that we developed or renovated to third parties, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance. we have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities. as a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties or their subcontractors could result in services not being provided, projects not being completed on time, or on budget, or at all, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures, including those in which we own a preferred interest, with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. as of december 31, 2018, we had active joint ventures and partnerships, including our preferred equity investments, with a total equity investment of $780.9 million. we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property or otherwise adversely impact us. moreover, our partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. also, our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. in general, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm length marketing process and could cause us to recognize unanticipated capital gains or losses or the loss of fee income. we are also subject to other risks in connection with partnerships or joint ventures, including (i) a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner, and (iii) the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture. we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs. in connection with certain property acquisitions, we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers or dispose of the property in a transaction in which a gain is not recognized for federal income tax purposes by such sellers, and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions. these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance. however, subject to certain conditions, we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers. we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our properties and operating activities with limits of liability, deductibles and self-insured retentions customary within the multifamily industry. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 14 table of contents as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a component of expense. insurance premiums and the terms and conditions of insurance policies are subject to significant fluctuations and changes, which are generally outside of our control. we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. the financial condition of one or more insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. in addition, the failure or exit from the insurance market of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew or replace our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring properties. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; inability to hire and retain key personnel; lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and inability to achieve budgeted financial results. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. as the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. for example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or acm. environmental, health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. these requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if acm would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. in addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment. we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or 15 table of contents irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time, claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements and federal, state and local accessibility requirements in addition to those imposed by the americans with disabilities act. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. we are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances at locations where we operate regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. generally, we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws and regulations regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or unanticipated reductions in revenue, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change may result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and also may require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in revenue. risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change. our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas. should the impact of such climate change be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. risk of earthquake damage. some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of earthquake faults. we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. as a result, we may 16 table of contents experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management view, economically impractical. risk of accidental death or injury due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards. the accidental death or injury of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. we have in the past and may in the future originate mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than a senior mortgage secured by real property, because the security for the loan may lose all or substantially all of its value as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. as a result, we may not recover some of or all our investment. in addition, mezzanine loans typically have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. risk related to preferred equity investments. we have in the past and may in the future make preferred equity investments in corporations, limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing or managing real property. generally, we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity, and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors, managers, general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations. although we would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives, our partners may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent or that are inconsistent with our interests. further, if our partners were to fail to invest additional capital in the entity when required, we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment. our partners may fail to develop or operate the real property or refinance property indebtedness or sell the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner if at all. in addition, we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest. in the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations or becomes insolvent, we may lose our entire investment in the entity. risks related to ground leases. we have in the past and may in the future enter into, as either landlord or tenant, a long-term ground lease with respect to a property or a portion thereof. such ground leases may contain a rent reset provision that requires both parties to agree to a new rent or is based upon factors, for example fair market rent, that are not objective and are not within our control. we may not be able to agree with the counterparty to a revised rental rate, or the revised rental rate may be set by external factors, which could result in a different rental rate than we forecasted. in addition, the other party may not perform as expected under the ground lease or there may be a dispute with the other party to the ground lease. any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges, which could adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr common stock. a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ( gaap ), if we 17 table of contents were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of udr common stock. any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of udr common stock. a breach of information technology systems on which we rely could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. we rely on information technology systems, including the internet and networks and systems maintained and controlled by third party vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes. third party vendors collect and hold personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our tenants, prospective tenants and employees. we also maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons and entities with which we do business on our information technology systems. while we take steps, and generally require third party vendors to take steps, to protect the security of the information maintained in our and third party vendors information technology systems, including associate training and testing and the use of commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing of the information, it is possible that our or our third party vendors security measures will not be able to prevent human error or the systems improper functioning, or the loss, misappropriation, disclosure or corruption of personally identifiable information or other confidential or sensitive information, including information about our tenants and employees. cybersecurity breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, phishing scams, attacks by hackers, breaches due to employee error or misconduct, and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized access to information maintained on our information technology systems or the information technology systems of our third party vendors or other third parties or otherwise cause disruption or negative impacts to occur to our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. while we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cybersecurity breaches, there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cybersecurity breach. as the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems become more varied and sophisticated and the occurrence of such breaches becomes more frequent, we and our third party vendors and other third parties may be unable to adequately anticipate these techniques or breaches and implement appropriate preventative measures. any failure to prevent cybersecurity breaches and maintain the proper function, security and availability of our or our third party vendors and other third parties information technology systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation and brand, damage our competitive position, make it difficult for us to attract and retain tenants, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures. despite system redundancy and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our information technology systems, our information technology systems and the information technology systems maintained by our third party vendors are vulnerable to damage arising from any number of sources beyond our or our third party vendors control, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. any failure to maintain proper function and availability of our or third party vendors information technology systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. social media presents risks. the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure. negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation. further, employees or others may disclose non-public information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. as social media evolves we will be presented with new risks and challenges. 18 table of contents our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. changes in u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap, which is established by the financial accounting standards board (the fasb ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the fasb and the sec, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for u.s. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. risks related to our indebtedness and financings insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, the amounts under our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow, and increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr stockholders. failure to generate sufficient income could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient revenue to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr stockholders or the operating partnership or the downreit partnership unitholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; competition from other apartment communities; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing. expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, 19 table of contents we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt, including unsecured commercial paper, at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2018, udr had approximately $230.8 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 6.5% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. as of december 31, 2018, the operating partnership had approximately $27.0 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes all outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt, including unsecured commercial paper. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. our debt level may be increased. our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit, construction loans and other forms of secured debt, commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time, including due to regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets, for example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the basel iii capital requirements and the associated high volatility commercial real estate designation, which has adversely impacted the availability of loans, including construction loans, and the proceeds of and the interest rate thereon. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of udr existing stockholders could be diluted. failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. moody and standard &amp; poor routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt, commercial paper program and preferred stock. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets, including our ability to access the commercial paper market. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr stock. our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it, the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably. those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing, such as the commercial paper market. any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr common stock. if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr common or preferred stock. a change in u.s. government policy or support regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business. while in recent years we have decreased our borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac, fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing 20 table of contents market including potential purchasers of our properties. potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the u.s. have been suggested, including options that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing fannie mae and freddie mac are able to provide, limitations on the loans that the agencies may make, which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties, or the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally, it may adversely affect interest rates, capital availability, development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and, as a result, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our results of operations. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including, for periods prior to 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code, and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year. 21 table of contents dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. in general, the maximum u.s. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual u.s. stockholders is 20%. unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit, our regular dividends (i.e., dividends other than capital gain dividends) to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. however, under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, our individual u.s. stockholders generally may deduct 20% of such regular dividends under section 199a of the code, reducing the effective tax rate applicable to such dividends (although such provision will expire after 2025 absent future legislation). udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established taxable reit subsidiaries. despite udr qualification as a reit, its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for certain of these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, udr is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to udr stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws, including the enactment of certain tax reform measures, could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. the recently passed tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 significantly changed the u.s. federal income taxation of u.s. businesses and their owners, including reits and their stockholders. the impact of the act on us and our stockholders is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period of time. for example, the act contained provisions that may reduce the relative competitive advantage of operating as a reit, including the lowering of income tax rates on individuals and corporations, which eases the burden of double taxation on corporate dividends and potentially causes the single level of taxation on reit distributions to become relatively less attractive. the act also contains provisions allowing the expensing of capital expenditures, which could result in the bunching of taxable income and required distributions for reits, and provisions extending the depreciable lives of certain real estate assets and further limiting the deductibility of interest expense, which could negatively impact the real estate market. in addition, although the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was recently passed, there can be no assurance that future changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws or regulatory changes will not be proposed or enacted that could impact our business and financial results. the reit rules are regularly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the u.s. treasury department, which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes. if enacted, certain of such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. 22 table of contents we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and any new u.s. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will impact the real estate investment industry or reits. prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and potential future changes to the federal tax laws on an investment in our shares. we may be adversely affected by changes in state and local tax laws and may become subject to tax audits from time to time. because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and local jurisdictions in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr stockholders. in the normal course of business, we or our affiliates (including entities through which we own real estate) may also become subject to federal, state or local tax audits. if we (or such entities) become subject to federal, state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships, but cannot guarantee that they will qualify. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes, and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes. if classified as partnerships, the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability. however, the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were publicly traded partnerships, unless at least 90% of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code. a publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). although neither the operating partnership nor the downreit partnership partnership units are traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption rights of their limited partners, the operating partnership and downreit partnership units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the safe harbors under the applicable tax regulations. qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. if either the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax liabilities, and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code. our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification. moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit. our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. in addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. risks related to our organization and ownership of udr stock changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange ( nyse ), on which we list udr common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of udr common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in udr common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. in addition to the risks listed in 23 table of contents this risk factors section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr common stock, including: general market and economic conditions; actual or anticipated variations in udr quarterly operating results or dividends or udr payment of dividends in shares of udr stock; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt; decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of udr stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; a change in analyst ratings; additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; speculation in the press or investment community; terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which udr securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; failure to qualify as a reit; strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; failure to satisfy listing requirements of the nyse; governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and the issuance of additional shares of udr common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under udr at-the-market equity distribution program. many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. we may change the dividend policy for udr common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have an adverse effect on the market price of udr common stock. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in udr stockholders best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in udr stockholders best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr stock 24 table of contents representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of udr stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr stockholders or might otherwise be in udr stockholders best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 65 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

trust, or reit, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, disposes of, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets throughout the united states. the high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential. at december 31, 2019, our consolidated real estate portfolio consisted of 148 communities located in 20 markets, consisting of 47,010 completed apartment homes, which are held directly or through our subsidiaries, including the operating partnership and the downreit partnership, and consolidated joint ventures. in addition, we have an ownership interest in 5,268 completed or to-be-completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships, including 2,138 apartment homes owned by entities in which we hold preferred equity investments. at december 31, 2019, the company was developing three wholly-owned communities totaling 878 homes, none of which have been completed. at december 31, 2019, the operating partnership's consolidated real estate portfolio included 52 communities located in 15 markets, with a total of 16,434 completed apartment homes. the operating partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, disposes of, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the united states. during the year ended december 31, 2019, rental revenues of the operating partnership represented approximately 39% of our total rental revenues. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this report as the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. in 2019, we declared total distributions of $1.37 per common share and paid dividends of $1.35 per common share. dividends dividends declared in paid in 2019 2019 first quarter $ 0.3425 $ 0.3225 second quarter 0.3425 0.3425 third quarter 0.3425 0.3425 fourth quarter 0.3425 0.3425 total $ 1.3700 $ 1.3500 udr was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation. in june 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland. the operating partnership is the successor-in-interest to united dominion realty, l.p., a limited partnership formed under the laws of virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. the operating partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a delaware limited partnership. our corporate offices are located at 1745 shea center drive, suite 200, highlands ranch, colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. our website is www.udr.com . the information contained on our website, including any information referred to in this report as being available on our website, is not a part of or incorporated into this report. as of february 17, 2020, we had 1,330 full-time associates and 21 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by udr. reporting segments we report in two segments: same-store communities and non-mature communities/other . our ame-store communities segment represents those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2018, and held as of december 31, 2019. these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. 3 table of contents our non-mature communities/other segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same-store communities, including, but not limited to, recently acquired, developed and redeveloped communities, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. for additional information regarding our operating segments, see note 16, reportable segments , in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report and note 12, reportable segments , in the notes to the operating partnership's consolidated financial statements included in this report. business objectives our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. to achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies: own and operate apartments in high barrier-to-entry markets, which are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement processes, low single-family home affordability and strong employment growth potential, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, redeveloping, and developing apartment communities; empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively; measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of liquidity, earnings and dividends. 2019 highlights in july 2019, the company marked its 47th year as a reit and, in october 2019, paid its 188th consecutive quarterly dividend. the company's annualized declared 2019 dividend of $1.37 represented a 6.2% increase over the previous year. total revenues increased 10.1% over the prior year primarily due to communities acquired during 2019 and rent growth. we achieved same-store revenue growth of 3.6% and same-store net operating income ( noi ) growth of 4.0%. we commenced the development of three communities located in denver, colorado, dublin, california, and addison, texas, with a total of 878 apartment homes. we acquired eight communities with a total of 2,919 apartment homes located in brooklyn, new york, st. petersburg, florida, towson, maryland, king of prussia, pennsylvania, waltham, massachusetts, norwood, massachusetts, and englewood, new jersey, for a total of approximately $911.9 million. we acquired two to-be-developed land parcels located in washington, d.c., and denver, colorado, for a total of approximately $40.8 million. we increased our ownership interest in two communities from our west coast development joint venture with a total of 541 apartment homes, located in anaheim, california and seattle, washington, for a total cash purchase price of approximately $53.5 million after the repayment of joint venture construction financing. we increased our ownership interest in one community from our udr/kfh joint venture with a total of 292 apartment homes, located in washington, d.c., for a total of $186.8 million and sold our 30% ownership interest in two communities from our udr/kfh joint venture with a total of 368 apartment homes, located in arlington, virginia and silver spring, maryland, for a collective sales price of $118.3 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $10.6 million. 4 table of contents we acquired the approximately 50% ownership interest not previously owned in 10 udr/metlife joint venture operating communities, one development community and four land parcels valued at $1.1 billion, or $564.2 million at our share, and sold our approximately 50% ownership interest in five udr/metlife joint venture operating communities valued at $645.8 million, or $322.9 million at our share, to metlife, and recognized a net gain on sale of $114.9 million at our share. we recognized a gain of $5.3 million from the sale of a parcel of land in los angeles, california. we contributed $67.0 million to four investments under our developer capital program, which earn preferred returns ranging between 9.0% to 12.5%. we issued $1.1 billion of senior unsecured medium-term notes (including a $300.0 million green bond ) at a weighted average interest rate of 3.2%, and prepaid $700.0 million of senior unsecured medium-term notes at a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%. we sold 7.0 million shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $312.3 million at a weighted average price per share of $45.29 under our atm program, and sold 1.3 million shares of common stock through a forward sales agreement for aggregate net proceeds of $63.5 million at a weighted average price per share of $47.41, which was also under our atm program. we sold an additional 7.5 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering for net proceeds of $349.8 million at a price per share of $46.65. refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for further information on the company's and the operating partnership's activities in 2019. our strategic vision our strategic vision is to be the multifamily public reit of choice. we intend to realize this vision by executing on our strategic objectives, which are: 1. maintaining a diversified portfolio and allocating capital to accretive investment opportunities 2. maintaining a strong balance sheet 3. consistently driving operating excellence 4. advancing a strong corporate culture and ensuring high resident satisfaction maintaining a diversified portfolio and allocating capital to accretive investment opportunities we believe greater portfolio diversification, as defined by geographic concentration, location within a market (i.e., urban or suburban) and property quality (i.e., a or b), reduces the volatility of our same-store growth throughout the real estate cycle, appeals to a wider renter and investor audience and lessens the market risk associated with owning a homogenous portfolio. diversified characteristics of our portfolio include: our consolidated apartment portfolio includes 148 communities located in 20 markets throughout the u.s., including both coastal and sunbelt locations; and our mix of urban/suburban communities is approximately 43%/57% and our mix of a/b quality properties is approximately 57%/43%. we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, high propensity to rent, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research. acquisitions and dispositions when evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider a wide variety of factors, including: whether it is located in a high barrier-to-entry market; 5 table of contents population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the market in which the property is located; geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; construction quality, condition and design of the property; current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; ability of the property's projected returns to exceed our cost of capital; potential for capital appreciation of the property; ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property; and competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include: whether it is in a market targeted for divestment or a reduction in investment; current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset; potential increases in new construction in the market area; areas with low job growth prospects; near- and long-term capital expenditure needs for the asset; and operating efficiencies. the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated year-end ownership position for the past five years ( dollars in thousands ): 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 homes acquired 7,079 462 508 3,246 homes disposed 868 218 1,782

includes 3,107 homes deconsolidated in 2015 upon contribution of communities by the operating partnership to the downreit partnership. 6 table of contents development activities our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio. how demographic trends, economic drivers, and multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the long-term and our portfolio strategy generally govern our review process on where and when to allocate development capital. at december 31, 2019, the company was developing three wholly-owned communities located in denver, colorado, addison, texas, and dublin, california, totaling 878 homes, none of which have been completed, with a budget of $278.5 million, in which we have a carrying value of $69.8 million. the communities are estimated to be completed between the first quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2022. redevelopment activities our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold: we aim to grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we incurred $35.6 million in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. as of december 31, 2019, the company was redeveloping 653 apartment homes, 250 of which have been completed, at two wholly-owned communities, located in boston, massachusetts and new york, new york, both of which are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021. the redevelopments include the renovation of building exteriors, corridors, and common area amenities as well as individual apartment homes. joint venture and partnership activities we have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projections, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement. maintaining a strong balance sheet we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace. we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate. financing activities as part of our plan to finance our activities, we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt, fund development and redevelopment activities, and acquire apartment communities. consistently driving operational excellence investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our business and our residents. our residents can conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our web-based resident internet portal or, increasingly, a smart-device application. as a result of transforming our operations through technology, residents' satisfaction has improved, and our operating teams have become more efficient. web-based technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and better pricing management of our available apartment homes. operating partnership strategies and vision the operating partnership's long-term strategic vision is the same as that of the company described above. 7 table of contents competitive conditions competition for new residents is generally intense across our markets. some competing communities offer amenities that our communities do not have. competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors, including sub-market supply and demand. in addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties, redevelop existing properties, and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do. we believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. we believe our competitive advantages include: a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts; access to sources of capital; geographic diversification with a presence in 20 markets across the country; and significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. moving forward, we will continue to optimize lease management, improve expense control, increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with metrics that impact our bottom-line performance. we believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio's strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational upside. communities at december 31, 2019, our consolidated real estate portfolio included 148 communities with a total of 47,010 completed apartment homes, which included the operating partnership's consolidated real estate portfolio of 52 communities with a total of 16,434 completed apartment homes. the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents. at december 31, 2019, the company was developing three wholly-owned communities located in denver, colorado, dublin, california, and addison, texas, totaling 878 homes, none of which have been completed, with a budget of $278.5 million, in which we have a carrying value of $69.8 million. the communities are estimated to be completed between the first quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2022. at december 31, 2019, the company was redeveloping 653 apartment homes, 250 of which have been completed, at two wholly-owned communities, located in boston, massachusetts and new york, new york, both of which are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021. the redevelopments include the renovation of building exteriors, corridors, and common area amenities as well as individual apartment homes. same-store community comparison we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same-store communities' noi, which is total rental revenue, less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management. our same-store community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. net income attributable to common stockholders was $180.9 million as compared to $199.2 million in the prior year period. the decrease was primarily driven by higher gains on the sale of real estate in the prior year and an increase in depreciation expense and interest expense in 2019, partially offset by higher total revenue and gains on the sale of unconsolidated real estate. 8 table of contents for the year ended december 31, 2019, our same-store noi increased by $26.7 million compared to the prior year. our same-store community properties provided 85.4% of our total noi for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in noi for the 37,959 same-store apartment homes, or 80.7% of our portfolio, was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates, an increase in reimbursement, ancillary and fee income and a decrease in personnel expense, partially offset by an increase in repair and maintenance expense and real estate taxes. for the year ended december 31, 2019, the operating partnership's same-store noi increased by $10.3 million compared to the prior year. the operating partnership's same-store community properties provided 92.9% of its total noi for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in noi for the 15,723 same-store apartment homes, or 95.7% of the operating partnership's portfolio, was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates, an increase in reimbursement, ancillary and fee income and a decrease in personnel expense, partially offset by an increase in repair and maintenance expense and real estate taxes. revenue growth in 2020 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, new supply, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents. tax matters udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, udr must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. provided we maintain our qualification as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary ( trs ) to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation, and therefore, subject to federal, state and local income taxes. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. however, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level. inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs, the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2019. environmental matters various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. to date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. we have a property management plan for hazardous materials. as part of the plan, phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. in addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development 9 table of contents of any property. nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. in some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. we do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. in addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. we are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family apartment industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. available information both udr and the operating

factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership. the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate or unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, debt levels, housing markets, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels and rental revenues would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr's stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the global, national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives with respect to home ownership, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms; the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; changes in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating or impacting rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs or otherwise impact us. the geographic concentration of our communities in certain markets could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely impacted by economic or other conditions. for the year ended december 31, 2019, approximately 52.7% of our total noi was generated from communities located in the washington, d.c. metropolitan area (16.2%), orange county, ca (14.2%), the san francisco bay area, ca (12.2%) and new york, ny (10.1%). as a result, if any one or more of these markets is adversely impacted by regional or local economic conditions or real estate market conditions, such conditions may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse. in addition, if one or more of these markets is adversely affected by changes in regional or local regulations, including those related to rent control or stabilization, such regulations may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operation than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse. 11 table of contents we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire, or the terms of renewals or new leases may be less favorable than current leases. when our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. furthermore, because the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. if residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase. we face certain risks related to our retail and commercial space. certain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties. the long term nature of our retail and commercial leases (generally five to ten years with market-based or fixed-price renewal options) and the characteristics of many of our tenants (generally small and/or local businesses) may subject us to certain risks. the longer term leases could result in below market lease rates over time. tenants may provide guarantees and other credit support which may prove to be inadequate or uncollectable, and the failure rate of small and/or local businesses may be higher than average. we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates. also, when leases for our retail or commercial space terminate either at the end of the lease or because a tenant leaves early, the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the prior lease terms. our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space. the presence of competitive alternatives may adversely affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. if our retail or commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy, they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations, or cease their operations, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt, general and administrative expenses and other expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold or the purchase price may be reduced to cover any cost of correcting defects or making improvements. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio in order to meet our strategic objectives, which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or our ability to fund other activities in which we may want to engage such as the purchase of properties, development or redevelopment, or funding the developer capital program. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities, among others: a significant portion of the proceeds from property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 12 table of contents we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks, among others: we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, term and/or loan-to-value ratios, or at all, all of which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential acquisitions; even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the debt used to finance the acquisition; even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may not complete the acquisition for a variety of reasons after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we subsequently do not complete; when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; the expected occupancy rates and rental rates may differ from actual results; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could materially and adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to acquire attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly-owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks, among others: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities on favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, term and/or loan-to-value ratios, or at all, which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental or quasi-governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; cost may be higher or yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than expected; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such development opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; 13 table of contents occupancy rates, rents and concessions at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our expected return on our investment and our overall profitability goals; and when we sell communities or properties that we developed or renovated to third parties, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance. we have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties, such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities or joint venture partners, among others. as a result, bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties or their subcontractors could result in services not being provided, projects not being completed on time, or on budget, or at all, or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties' ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and/or acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures, including those in which we own a preferred interest, with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. as of december 31, 2019, we had active joint ventures and partnerships, including our preferred equity investments, with a total equity investment of $588.3 million. we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which could adversely impact us. moreover, our partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. also, our partners might fail to make capital contributions when due, which may require us to contribute additional capital or may negatively impact the project. in addition, we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. in general, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the seller) or of the other partner's interest in the partnership or joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm's length marketing process and could cause us to recognize unanticipated capital gains or losses or the loss of fee income. we are also subject to other risks in connection with partnerships or joint ventures, including (i) a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions (which could result in litigation or disposing of an asset at a time at which we otherwise would not sell the asset), (ii) limitations on our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner, and (iii) requirements to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture. we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs. in connection with certain property acquisitions, we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers or dispose of the property in a transaction in which a gain is not recognized for federal income tax purposes by such sellers, and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions. these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance. however, subject to certain conditions, we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers. we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our properties and operating activities with limits of liability, deductibles and self-insured retentions customary within the multifamily industry. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses 14 table of contents in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a component of expense. insurance premiums and the terms and conditions of insurance policies are subject to significant fluctuations and changes, which are generally outside of our control. we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. the financial condition of one or more insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. in addition, the failure, or exit or partial exit from an insurance market, of one or more insurance companies may affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage in the amounts that we seek, or at all, or increase the costs to renew or replace our insurance policies, or cause us to self-insure a portion of the risk, or increase the cost of insuring properties. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; inability to hire and retain key personnel; lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and inability to achieve budgeted financial results. failure to succeed with new initiatives may limit our ability to grow same-store noi . we have in the past developed and may in the future develop initiatives that are intended to drive operating efficiencies and grow same-store noi, including smart home technologies and self-service options that are accessible to residents through smart devices. we may incur significant costs and divert resources in connection with such initiatives, and these initiatives may not perform as projected, which could adversely affect our results of operations and the market price of udr's common stock. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination or we could be required to incur additional costs to change how the property is constructed or operated due to presence of such substances. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. as the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. for example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or acm. environmental, health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. 15 table of contents these requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if acm would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. in addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment. we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental or building condition issues will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others for property damage or personal injury. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. claims have been asserted, and in the future claims may be asserted, against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, if claims arise, we may expend resources and incur costs in investigating and resolving such claims even if our property was in compliance with the law. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements and federal, state and local accessibility requirements in addition to those imposed by the americans with disabilities act. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. the adoption of, or changes to, rent control, rent stabilization, eviction, tenants' rights and similar laws and regulations in our markets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and property values. various state and local governments have enacted and may continue to enact rent control, rent stabilization, or limitations, and similar laws and regulations that could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees, including laws or court orders, either of which could have a retroactive effect. for example, in june 2019, the state of new york enacted new rent control regulations known as the housing stability and tenant protection act of 2019 and, in october of 2019, the state of california enacted the tenant protection act of 2019. we have seen a recent increase in governments enacting or considering, or being urged to consider, such laws and regulations. state and local governments or courts also may make changes to laws related to allowable fees, eviction and other tenants' rights laws and regulations (including changes that apply retroactively) that could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our properties. laws and regulations regarding rent control, rent stabilization, eviction, tenants' rights, and similar matters, as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such laws and regulations, may limit our ability to charge market rents, limit our ability to increase rents, evict delinquent tenants or change fees, or recover increases in our operating expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of our properties. compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. we are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances at locations where we operate regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations. generally, we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the 16 table of contents ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, (ii) laws and regulations regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, or (iii) employment related laws, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change may result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and also may require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in revenue. risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events. our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including mudslides, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, snow or ice storms, or other severe inclement weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. risk of potential climate change . to the extent significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located occur, we may experience extreme weather conditions and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to, and/or a decrease in demand for, our communities located in these areas or communities that are otherwise affected by these changes. should the impact of such climate changes be material in nature, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. risk of earthquake damage. some of our communities are located in areas subject to earthquakes, including in the general vicinity of earthquake faults. we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity. as a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management's view, economically impractical. risk of accidental death or injury due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards. the accidental death or injury of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. risk of pandemics or other health crisis . a pandemic, epidemic, or other health crisis where our communities are located or areas in which vendors on which we rely are located, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. we have in the past and may in the future originate mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or subordinated loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than a senior mortgage secured by real property, because the security for the loan may lose all or substantially all of its value as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property. in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may 17 table of contents not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. as a result, we may not recover some of or all our investment. in addition, mezzanine loans typically have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. risk related to preferred equity investments. we have in the past and may in the future make preferred equity investments in corporations, limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing or managing real property. generally, we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity, and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors, managers, general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations. although we would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives, our partners may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent or that are inconsistent with our interests. further, if our partners were to fail to invest additional capital in the entity when required, we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment. our partners may fail to develop or operate the real property or refinance property indebtedness or sell the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner if at all. in addition, we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest. in the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations or becomes insolvent, we may lose our entire investment in the entity. risks related to ground leases. we have in the past and may in the future enter into, as either landlord or tenant, a long-term ground lease with respect to a property or a portion thereof. such ground leases may contain a rent reset provision that requires both parties to agree to a new rent or is based upon factors, for example fair market rent, that are not objective and are not within our control. we may not be able to agree with the counterparty to a revised rental rate, or the revised rental rate may be set by external factors, which could result in a different rental rate than we forecasted. in the past we have had disagreements with respect to revised rental rates and certain of such disagreements have gone to arbitration (for resolution as provided in the applicable lease agreement) and have been resolved in a manner adverse to us. in addition, the other party may not perform as expected under the ground lease or there may be a dispute with the other party to the ground lease. any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges, which could adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ' common stock. a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ( gaap ), if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of udr's common stock. any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ' stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations. in addition, if we have one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of udr's common stock. a breach of information technology systems on which we rely could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. we rely on information technology systems, including the internet and networks and systems maintained and controlled by third party vendors and other third parties, 18 table of contents to process, transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes. third party vendors collect and hold personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our tenants, prospective tenants and employees. we also maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons and entities with which we do business on our information technology systems. while we take steps, and generally require third party vendors to take steps, to protect the security of the information maintained in our and third party vendors' information technology systems, including associate training and testing and the use of commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing of the information, it is possible that our or our third party vendors' security measures will not be able to prevent human error or the systems' improper functioning, or the loss, misappropriation, disclosure or corruption of personally identifiable information or other confidential or sensitive information, including information about our tenants and employees. cybersecurity breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, phishing scams, attacks by hackers, breaches due to employee error or misconduct, and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized access to information maintained on our information technology systems or the information technology systems of our third party vendors or other third parties or otherwise cause disruption or negative impacts to occur to our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. while we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cybersecurity breaches, there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cybersecurity breach. we have in the past experienced cybersecurity breaches on our information technology systems, and, while none to date have been material, we expect such breaches may occur in the future. as the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems become more varied and sophisticated and the occurrence of such breaches becomes more frequent, we and our third party vendors and other third parties may be unable to adequately anticipate these techniques or breaches and implement appropriate preventative measures. any failure to prevent cybersecurity breaches and maintain the proper function, security and availability of our or our third party vendors' and other third parties' information technology systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation and brand, damage our competitive position, make it difficult for us to attract and retain tenants, and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures. despite system redundancy and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our information technology systems, our information technology systems and the information technology systems maintained by our third party vendors are vulnerable to damage arising from any number of sources beyond our or our third party vendors' control, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. any failure to maintain proper function and availability of our or third party vendors' information technology systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. social media presents risks. the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure. negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation. further, employees or others may disclose non-public information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. as social media evolves we will be presented with new risks and challenges. our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. changes in u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap, which is established by the financial accounting standards board (the fasb ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the fasb and the sec, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for u.s. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. 19 table of contents third-party expectations relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks . there is an increasing focus from certain investors, tenants, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance factors. some investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased in number, resulting in varied and in some cases inconsistent standards. in addition, the criteria by which companies' corporate responsibility practices are assessed are evolving, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. alternatively, if we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific third-party provider, some investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. we may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. furthermore, if our competitors' corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. in addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental, social and governance matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. if we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, tenants and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and financial results could be adversely affected. risks related to our indebtedness and financings insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required debt payments and satisfy udr's distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, the amounts under our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow, and increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr's stockholders. failure to generate sufficient income could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient revenue to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr's stockholders or the operating partnership's or the downreit partnership's unitholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants' perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; competition from other apartment communities; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing. 20 table of contents expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenue from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt, including unsecured commercial paper, at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2019, udr had approximately $378.6 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 8.0% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. as of december 31, 2019, the operating partnership had approximately $27.0 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 27.1% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt, including unsecured commercial paper. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. the phase-out of libor and transition to sofr as a benchmark interest rate could have adverse effects. in 2018, the alternative reference rate committee identified the secured overnight financing rate ( sofr ) as the alternative to libor. sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by u.s. treasury securities, published by the federal reserve bank of new york. by the end of 2021, it is expected that new contracts will not reference libor and will instead use sofr. due to the broad use of libor as a reference rate, all financial market participants, including us, are impacted by the risks associated with this transition and therefore it could adversely affect our operations and cash flows. our debt level may be increased. our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit, construction loans and other forms of secured debt, commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time, including due to regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets, for example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the basel iii capital requirements and the associated high volatility commercial real estate designation, which has adversely impacted the availability of loans, including construction loans, and the proceeds of and the interest rate thereon. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of udr's existing stockholders could be diluted. failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. moody's and standard &amp; poor's routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt, commercial paper program and preferred stock. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets, including our ability to access the commercial paper market. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ' stock. our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it, the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably. those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing, such as the commercial paper market. any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for 21 table of contents acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr's common stock. if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr's common or preferred stock. a change in u.s. government policy or support regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business. while in recent years we have decreased our borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac, fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing market including potential purchasers of our properties. potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the u.s. have been, and may in the future be, suggested that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing fannie mae and freddie mac are able to provide, limitations on the loans that the agencies may make, which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties, or the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally, it may adversely affect interest rates, capital availability, development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and, as a result, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our results of operations. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr's stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including, for periods prior to 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr's stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the 22 table of contents internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr's stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr's stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code, and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year. dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. in general, the maximum u.s. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual u.s. stockholders is 20%. unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit, our regular dividends (i.e., dividends other than capital gain dividends) paid to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. however, individual u.s. stockholders generally may deduct 20% of such regular dividends under section 199a of the code, reducing the effective tax rate applicable to such dividends (although such provision will expire after 2025 absent future legislation). udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established taxable reit subsidiaries. despite udr's qualification as a reit, its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for certain of these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm's length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, udr is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to udr's stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr's ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws, including the enactment of certain tax reform measures, could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate and reits, including the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, the full impact of which may not become evident for some period of time. there can be no assurance that future changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws or regulatory changes will not be proposed or enacted that could impact our business and financial results. the reit rules are regularly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the 23 table of contents u.s. treasury department, which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes. if enacted, certain of such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent any new u.s. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will impact the real estate investment industry or reits. prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential future changes to the federal tax laws on an investment in our shares. we may be adversely affected by changes in state and local tax laws and may become subject to tax audits from time to time. because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and local jurisdictions in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr's stockholders. in the normal course of business, we or our affiliates (including entities through which we own real estate) may also become subject to federal, state or local tax audits. if we (or such entities) become subject to federal, state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships, but cannot guarantee that they will qualify. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes, and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes. if classified as partnerships, the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability. however, the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were publicly traded partnerships, unless at least 90% of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code. a publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). although neither the operating partnership's nor the downreit partnership's partnership units are traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption rights of their limited partners, the operating partnership's and downreit partnership's units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the safe harbors under the applicable tax regulations. qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. if either the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax liabilities, and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. in addition, even if the 90% test were met if the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were a publicly traded partnership, there could be adverse tax impacts for certain limited partners. qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code. our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification. moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit. our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. in addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. risks related to our organization and ownership of udr's stock changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ' common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange ( nyse ), on which we list udr's common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of udr's 24 table of contents common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in udr's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. in addition to the risks listed in this risk factors section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr's common stock, including: general market and economic conditions; actual or anticipated variations in udr's quarterly operating results or dividends or udr's payment of dividends in shares of udr's stock; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt; decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of udr's stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; a change in analyst ratings; additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; speculation in the press or investment community; terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which udr's securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; failure to qualify as a reit; strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; failure to satisfy listing requirements of the nyse; governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and the issuance of additional shares of udr's common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under udr's at-the-market equity distribution program. many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr's common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. we may change the dividend policy for udr ' common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr's common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have an adverse effect on the market price of udr's common stock. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in udr ' stockholders ' best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be 25 table of contents in udr's stockholders' best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr's stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors' prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ' stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ' stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ' stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr's stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of udr's stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr's stockholders or might otherwise be in udr's stockholders' best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 63 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in

market risk - - -------------------------------------------------------------------- information required by this regarding quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is included in part ii, item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k included in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.risk factors 12 risk factors there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments and real estate taxes, generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; 12 table of contents the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; declines in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we have periodically disposed of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own, and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities: a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales; and federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure related to the acquired property may go undetected during our due diligence procedures; when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. we do not expect to acquire apartment communities at the rate we have in prior years, which may limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business and the market value of our securities. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to 13 table of contents acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect growth. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than pro forma; if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. in some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 14 table of contents failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; inability to hire and retain key personnel; lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and inability to achieve budgeted financial results. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. although inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our debt interest and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rental rates. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. if we use such a structure, we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. real estate tax and other laws. generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the 15 table of contents restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. risk of damage from catastrophic weather events. certain of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults, mudslides and fires, and others where there are hurricanes, tornadoes or risks of other inclement weather. the adverse weather events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price. our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service in not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. risks related to our indebtedness and financing insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. additionally, we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and increase our financing costs. failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay 16 table of contents distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing. expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. financing could be impacted by negative capital market conditions. recently, domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty. while this condition has occurred most visibly within the subprime mortgage lending sector of the credit market, liquidity has tightened in overall domestic financial markets, including the investment grade debt and equity capital markets. consequently, there is greater risk that the financial institutions we do business with could experience disruptions that would negatively affect our ability to obtain financing. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit, impact our tenant base, and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our stock. our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. the united states stock and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing. continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our business. additionally, due to this uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might 17 table of contents adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common or preferred stock. the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business. prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels. current tightening of credit in financial markets and increasing unemployment may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis. disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy. the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2009, we had approximately $709.2 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 20.7% of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit. we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders. 18 table of contents if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the two taxable years following the year in which we first failed to qualify. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. reits may pay a portion of dividends in common stock. in december 2009, the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure 2010-12, which expanded previously issued temporary guidance relating to certain stock distributions made by publicly traded reits to satisfy their tax-related distribution requirements. this expanded temporary guidance is intended to permit reits to limit cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity during the current downturn in economic conditions. under this expanded guidance, for stock dividends declared on or after january 1, 2008 and before december 31, 2012, with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december 31, 2011, the internal revenue service will treat a distribution of stock by a publicly traded reit, pursuant to certain stockholder elections to receive either stock or cash, as a taxable distribution of property, provided that, among other conditions, (i) the total amount of cash available for distribution is not less than 10% of the aggregate declared distribution, and (ii) if too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata amount of cash corresponding to its respective entitlement under the declaration, but in no event will any such electing stockholder receive less than 10% of the stockholder entire entitlement in money. the amount of such stock distribution will generally be treated as equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead. if we pay a portion of our dividends in shares of our common stock pursuant to this temporary guidance, our stockholders may receive less cash than they received in distributions in prior years and the market value of our securities may decline. we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite our qualification as a reit, our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, we are subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, 19 table of contents we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws. as discussed in the risk factors above, because we are organized and qualify as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to our stockholders. in the normal course of business, entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits. if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. risks related to our organization and our shares changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange, on which we list our common shares, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. the market price per share of our common stock may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including: general market and economic conditions, actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends or our payment of dividends in shares of our stock, changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates, difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt, decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations, publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry, the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate-based companies), general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends, a change in analyst ratings, adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future, speculation in the press or investment community, 20 table of contents terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending, governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws, and the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under our at-the-market equity distribution program. many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in our stockholders best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2 / 3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. these provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures

item 1. business general udr is a self administered real estate investment trust, or reit, that owns, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages apartment communities in select markets throughout the united states. at december 31, 2010, our consolidated apartment portfolio included 172 communities located in 23 markets, with a total of 48,553 completed apartment homes, which are held through our operating partnerships, including the operating partnership and heritage communities l.p., our subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures. in addition, we have an ownership interest in 37 communities containing 9,891 completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures. at december 31, 2010, the operating partnership consolidated apartment portfolio included 81 communities located in 19 markets, with a total of 23,351 completed apartment homes. the operating partnership owns, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, manages, and disposes of multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located in the united states. the high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive single-family home prices and significant employment growth potential. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2010, revenues of the operating partnership represented approximately 55% of our total rental revenues. udr elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this report as the code . to continue to qualify as a reit, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. as a qualified reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such 2 table of contents net income to our stockholders annually. in 2010, we declared total distributions of $0.730 per common share and paid dividends of $0.725 per common share. dividends declared in 2010 dividends paid in 2010 first quarter $ 0.180 $ 0.180 second quarter 0.180 0.180 third quarter 0.185 0.180 fourth quarter 0.185 0.185 total $ 0.730 $ 0.725 udr was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation. in june 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland. the operating partnership was formed in 2004 as delaware limited partnership. the operating partnership is the successor-in-interest to united dominion realty, l.p., a limited partnership formed under the laws of virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. our corporate offices are located at 1745 shea center drive, suite 200, highlands ranch, colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. our website is located at www.udr.com . as of february 17, 2011, we had 1,547 full-time associates and 85 part-time associates, all of whom were employed by udr. reporting segments we report in two segments: same communities and non-mature/other communities. our same communities segment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2009, and held as of december 31, 2010. these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not held for disposition within the current year. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. our non-mature/other communities segment includes those communities that were acquired or developed in 2008, 2009 or 2010, sold properties, redevelopment properties, properties classified as real estate held for disposition, condominium conversion properties, joint venture properties, properties managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. for additional information regarding our operating segments, see note 15 to udr consolidated financial statements and note 12 to the operating partnership consolidated financial statements. business objectives our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. to achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies: own and operate apartments in markets that have the best growth prospects based on favorable job formation and low home affordability, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, and developing apartment communities; empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively; measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of earnings and dividends. 3 table of contents 2010 highlights we acquired five operating communities with 1,374 homes located in orange county, california; baltimore, maryland; los angeles, california; and boston, massachusetts for $412 million. we also acquired a land parcel located in san francisco, california for $23.6 million. we acquired an interest in a joint venture with metropolitan life insurance company ( metlife ) for $100.8 million. the joint venture owns 26 operating communities with 5,748 homes and 11 parcels of land with the potential to develop approximately 2,300 additional homes. the majority of the portfolio is comprised of mid/high-rise buildings located in urban, in-fill locations. the assets are located in many of our core markets with rent and quality levels at the top of each market. we completed the development of four wholly-owned communities with 1,575 homes at a total cost of $259.7 million. we completed the development of one community (274 apartment homes) held by a consolidated joint venture for a total cost of $122.3 million. we repaid $187.3 million of secured debt and $50 million of maturing medium-term unsecured notes. the $187.3 million of secured debt includes $70.5 million for a maturing construction loan held by one of our consolidated joint ventures, repayment of $52.7 million of credit facilities and $64.1 million of mortgage payments. we repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of $29.2 million for $29.4 million resulting in a loss on extinguishment of $1 million, which includes the write off of related deferred finance charges. the unsecured debt repurchased by the company matures in 2011. as a result of this repurchase, the loss is represented as an addition to interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations. we closed on a $250 million, five-year unsecured term loan facility of which $100 million was swapped into a fixed rate of 3.76% and $150 million has rate of libor plus 200 basis points. in 2009, we entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement with respect to the issue and sale by us from time to time of our medium-term notes, series a due nine months or more from date of issue. in february 2010, we issued $150 million of 5.25% senior unsecured medium-term notes under the amended and restated distribution agreement. these notes were priced at 99.46% of the principal amount at issuance and the unamortized discount was $519,000 at december 31, 2010. in 2009, we initiated an at the market equity distribution program pursuant to which we may sell up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock from time to time to or through sales agents, by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the new york stock exchange at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the applicable agent. during the year ended december 31, 2010, we sold 6,144,367 shares of common stock through this program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $110.8 million at a weighted average price per share of $18.04. aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting related expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately $2.2 million, were approximately $108.6 million. we initiated an underwritten public offering to sell 16,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $20.35 per share. we granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of common stock to cover overallotments, if any. we sold 18,400,000 shares of common stock in this offering for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $374.4 million at a price of $20.35 per share. aggregate net proceeds from the offering, after deducting related expenses were approximately $359.2 million. other than the following, there were no significant changes to the operating partnership business during 2010 (the above 2010 highlights relate to udr or other subsidiaries of udr): on september 30, 2010, the operating partnership guaranteed certain outstanding securities of udr, such that the operating partnership, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the applicable securities and to the trustee and their 4 table of contents successors and assigns under the respective indenture (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of udr under the respective indenture whether for principal of or interest on the securities (and premium, if any), and all other monetary obligations of udr under the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable securities and (b) the full and punctual performance within the applicable grace periods of all other obligations of udr under the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable securities. our strategies and vision we previously announced our vision to be the innovative multifamily public real estate investment trust of choice. we identified the following strategies to guide decision-making and growth: 1. strengthen our portfolio 2. continually improve operations 3. maintain access to low-cost capital strengthen our portfolio we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. portfolio decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research, taking into account job growth, multifamily permitting and housing affordability. for the year ended december 31, 2010, approximately 55.7% of our same store net operating income was provided by our communities located in california, metropolitan washington, d.c., oregon and washington state. operating partnership strategies and vision the operating partnership long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets. as a result, the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in california, metropolitan washington d.c. and the washington state markets over the past years. prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns. markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability and favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. acquisitions and dispositions during 2010, in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our portfolio, we acquired five operating communities with 1,374 apartment homes for approximately $412 million. when evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider: population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located; geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; construction quality, condition and design of the community; current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; potential for capital appreciation of the property; ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; 5 table of contents prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include: current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset; potential increases in new construction in the market area; areas where the economy is not expected to grow substantially; markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and operating efficiencies. during 2010, we sold one 149 apartment home community. this apartment home community was not owned by the operating partnership. the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions, apartment community dispositions and our consolidated year-end ownership position for the past five years ( dollars in thousands ): 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 homes acquired 1,374 289 4,558 2,671 2,763 homes disposed 149

we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. during the year ended december 31, 2010, we incurred $30.8 million in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. joint venture activities in 2010, we completed the development of an apartment community located in bellevue, washington with 274 apartment homes, 45,394 square feet

control of the joint venture, we were required to consolidate the joint venture. on december 30, 2009, we entered into an agreement with our partner to purchase its 49% interest in elements too for $3.2 million, which was paid in 2010. at closing, our interest in elements too increased to 98%. we are a partner with an unaffiliated third party in a joint venture ( 989 elements ) which owns and

the year ended december 31, 2009, the joint venture decided to continue to operate the retail property as opposed to developing a high rise apartment building on the site. on december 30, 2009, our partner relinquished its voting rights and approval rights and its ability to substantively participate in the decision-making process of the joint venture. our partner also resigned as managing

partnership ). the udr/metlife partnership owns a portfolio of 26 operating communities containing 5,748 homes and 11 land parcels with the potential to develop approximately 2,300 additional homes. under the terms of the udr/metlife partnership, we will act as the general partner and earn fees for property and asset management and financing transactions. we acquired ownership interests of 12.27%

partnership is not a party to any of the joint venture activities described above. continually improve operations we continue to make progress on automating our business as a way to drive operating efficiencies and to better meet the changing needs of our residents. since its launch in january 2009, our residents have been utilizing the resident internet portal on our website. our residents have access to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to pay rent on line and to submit service requests. in july 2010, we completed the roll out of online renewals throughout our entire portfolio. as a result of transforming operations through technology our residents get the convenience they want and our operating teams have become more efficient. these improvements in adopting the web as a way to conduct business with us have also resulted in a decline in marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and improved capabilities to better manage pricing of our available apartment homes. in 2010, we launched an enhanced www.udr.com website along and a new modern living website that highlights our premier urban-style location communities. both udr.com and modern living feature innovative point-of-view walking tours (at select locations), social media content sharing and a new save to favorites feature that entices first-time visitors to revisit www.udr.com. in addition to improvements to www.udr.com, we also increased our suite of mobile and tablet device offerings with the addition of an ipad, android, blackberry and palm pre apartment search applications. these overall enhancements have contributed to increasing our web visitor traffic to over 2.3 million visitors (up 24%) and almost 1.5 million organic search engine visitors (up 30%) which contributed to a 20% year-over-year lead stream increase. maintaining access to low-cost capital we seek to maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek, and not just react to, opportunities available in the marketplace. we have structured our borrowings to stagger our debt maturities and to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt. special dividend on november 5, 2008, our board of directors declared a dividend on a pre-adjusted basis of $1.29 per share ( the special dividend ). the special dividend was paid on january 29, 2009 to stockholders of record on december 9, 2008. the dividend represented our fourth quarter recurring distribution of $0.33 per share and an additional special distribution of $0.96 per share due to taxable income arising from our dispositions occurring during the year. subject to our right to pay the entire special dividend in cash, stockholders had the option to make an election to receive payment in cash or in shares, however, the aggregate amount of cash payable to stockholders, other than cash payable in lieu of fractional shares, would not be less than $44.0 million. the special dividend, totaling $177.1 million, was paid on 137,266,557 shares issued and outstanding on the record date. approximately $133.1 million of the special dividend was paid through the issuance of 11,358,042 shares of common stock, which was determined based on the volume weighted average closing sales price of our common stock of $11.71 per share on the nyse on january 21, 2009 and january 22, 2009. in january 2010, the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) issued accounting standards update 2010-01, accounting for distributions to shareholders with components of stock and cash ( asu 2010-01 ), 8 table of contents which considers distributions that contain components of cash and stock and allows shareholders to select their preferred form of distribution as a stock dividend. such a distribution is treated as a stock issuance on the date the dividend is paid. at december 31, 2008, we accrued $133.1 million of distribution payable related to the special dividend. asu 2010-01 is effective for the company on december 15, 2009 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. as a result, we reversed the effect of the issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the special dividend, which was retroactively reflected in each of the historical periods presented within the company form 8-k filed with the securities and exchange commission, or the sec on may 22, 2009, and effectively issued these shares on january 29, 2009 (the payment date of the special dividend). financing activities as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we utilized proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt and acquire apartment communities. the following is a summary of our major financing activities in 2010: repaid $187.3 million of secured debt and $50.0 million of maturing medium-term unsecured notes. the $187.3 million of secured debt includes $70.5 million for a maturing construction loan held by one of our consolidated joint ventures, repayment of $52.7 million of credit facilities and $64.1 million of mortgage payments; repurchased unsecured debt with a notional amount of $29.2 million for $29.4 million resulting in a loss on extinguishment of $1 million, which includes the write off of related deferred finance charges. the unsecured debt repurchased by us matures in 2011. as a result of this repurchase, the loss is represented as an addition to interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations; closed on a $250 million, five-year unsecured term loan facility of which $100 million was swapped into a fixed rate of 3.76% and $150 million has a rate of libor plus 200 basis points; in 2009, we entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement with respect to the issue and sale by us from time to time of our medium-term notes, series a due nine months or more from date of issue. in february 2010, we issued $150 million of 5.25% senior unsecured medium-term notes under the amended and restated distribution agreement. these notes were priced at 99.46% of the principal amount at issuance and had a discount of $519,000 at december 31, 2010; in 2009, we initiated an at the market equity distribution program pursuant to which we may sell up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock from time to time to or through sales agents, by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the new york stock exchange at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the applicable agent. during the year ended december 31, 2010, we sold 6,144,367 shares of common stock through this program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $110.8 million at a weighted average price per share of $18.04. aggregate net proceeds from such sales, after deducting related expenses, including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately $2.2 million, were approximately $108.6 million; in 2010, we initiated an underwritten public offering to sell 16,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $20.35 per share. we granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of common stock to cover overallotments, if any. we sold 18,400,000 shares of common stock in this offering for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $374.4 million at a price of $20.35 per share. aggregate net proceeds from the offering, after deducting related expenses were approximately $359.2 million; and on september 30, 2010, the operating partnership guaranteed certain outstanding securities of udr, such that the operating partnership, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the applicable securities and to the trustee and their successors and assigns under the respective indenture (a) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of udr under the respective indenture whether for principal of or interest on the securities (and premium, if any), and all other monetary obligations of udr under the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable securities 9 table of contents and (b) the full and punctual performance within the applicable grace periods of all other obligations of udr under the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable securities. markets and competitive conditions at december 31, 2010, 55.7% of our consolidated same store net operating income and 76% of the operating partnership same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes located in california, metropolitan washington d.c., oregon, and washington state. we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings. competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. in addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do. we believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. we believe our competitive advantages include: a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts; purchasing power; geographic diversification with a presence in 23 markets across the country; and significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management, improved expense control, increased resident retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance. we believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational improvement in spite of the difficult economic environment. communities at december 31, 2010, our apartment portfolio included 172 consolidated communities having a total of 48,553 completed apartment homes and an additional 930 apartment homes under development, which included the operating partnership apartment portfolio of 81 consolidated communities having a total of 23,351 completed apartment homes. the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb expenses, such as water and sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident. in addition, it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home, and therefore should result in increased cash flow in the future. same store community comparison we believe that one pertinent qualitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same store community net operating income ( noi ), which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses. our same store community population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. 10 table of contents for the year ended december 31, 2010, our same store noi decreased by $6.2 million or 1.7% compared to the prior year. the decrease in noi for the 40,699 apartment homes which make up the same store population was driven by a decrease in rental rates and an increase in expenses which was partially offset by increased occupancy. for the year ended december 31, 2010, the operating partnership same store noi decreased by $6.0 million or 2.7% compared to the prior year. the decrease in noi for the 22,104 apartment homes which make up the same store population was driven by a decrease in revenue rental rates and increase in operating expenses which was partially offset by increased occupancy. revenue growth in 2011 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents. tax matters udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, udr must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. provided we maintain our qualification as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may utilize taxable reit subsidiaries to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. taxable reit subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular corporations and therefore are subject to federal, state and local income taxes. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. however, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level. inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2010. environmental matters various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. to date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. we have a property management plan for hazardous materials. as part of the plan, phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. in addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to 11 table of contents acquisition. the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. nevertheless, it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. in some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. we do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. in addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition. insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. we are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. executive officers of the company udr is the sole general partner of the operating

our control. the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or 14 table of contents dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily market and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, the downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments and real estate taxes, generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; declines in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. continued economic weakness following the economic recession that the u.s. economy recently experienced may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the u.s. economy continues to experience weakness following a severe recession, which has resulted in increased unemployment, decreased consumer spending and a decline in residential and commercial property values. although the u.s. economy has emerged from the recession, high levels of unemployment have persisted. if the economic recovery slows or stalls, we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels, our rental revenues and the value of our properties, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. substantial international, national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. the values of, and the cash flows from, the properties we own are affected by developments in global, national and local economies. as a result of the recent recession and the significant government interventions, federal, state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities. these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal, state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending, tax increases, public sector job losses, increased interest rates, currency devaluations or other adverse economic events, which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. neither inflation nor deflation has materially impacted our operations in the recent past. the general risk of inflation is that our debt interest and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate higher than our rental rates. the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. high unemployment may have a negative effect on our occupancy levels and our rental revenues. 15 table of contents we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities: a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single-and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition; even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete; an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure related to the acquired property may go undetected during our due diligence procedures; when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. 16 table of contents we do not expect to acquire apartment communities at the rate we have in prior years, which may limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business and the market value of our securities. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect growth. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than pro forma; if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. in some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. bankruptcy of developers in our development joint ventures could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the development of our communities and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the bankruptcy of one of the developers in any of our development joint ventures could materially and adversely affect the relevant property or properties. if the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a property has incurred recourse obligations, the discharge in bankruptcy of the developer may require us to honor a completion guarantee and therefore might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than we would otherwise bear. property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons 17 table of contents or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. if we use such a structure, we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; inability to hire and retain key personnel; lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and inability to achieve budgeted financial results. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations. as the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. for example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or acm. environmental, health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. 18 table of contents these requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if acm would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. in addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment. we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. real estate tax and other laws. generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. risk of damage from catastrophic weather events. certain of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults, mudslides and fires, and others where there are hurricanes, tornadoes or risks of other inclement weather. the adverse weather events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. 19 table of contents actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the market price of our common stock. a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under gaap if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of our common stock. any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price. our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service in not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be adversely affected by new laws and regulations. the current united states administration and congress have enacted, or called for consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues, including with respect to health care, financial regulation reform, climate control, executive compensation and others. we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material. at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us. certain rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the continuing economic downturn. these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression. the federal legislative response in this area has culminated most recently in the enactment on july 21, 2010 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd-frank act ). many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. the dodd-frank act, including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress, may 20 table of contents limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable. changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular, including certain provisions of the dodd-frank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the u.s. public markets. because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure, our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. changes in the system for establishing u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ( gaap ). gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board (the fasb ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. the international accounting standards board (the iasb ) is a london-based independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards ( ifrs ). ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world. ifrs differs in material respects from gaap. among other things, ifrs has historically relied more on fair value models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap. fair value models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities, often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap, which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation. the sec has proposed the mandatory adoption of ifrs by united states public companies starting in 2015, with early adoption permitted before that date. it is unclear at this time how the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted. in addition, switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs will be a complex undertaking. we may need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs. since these are new endeavors, and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately adopted are not now known, the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain. we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations. such evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that will be adopted. until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards to be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations. risks related to our indebtedness and financings insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr inc. distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to 21 table of contents repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr, inc. stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; competition from other apartment communities; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing. expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our stock. our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. during the past few years, the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing. continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our business. additionally, due to this uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not 22 table of contents be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common or preferred stock. the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business. prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels. tightening of credit in financial markets and high unemployment rates may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis. disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy. a change in u.s. government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business. fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate. we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans. in september 2008, the u.s. government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency. the administration has recently proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the u.s. that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sale assets. uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2010, udr, inc. had approximately $1 billion of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 29% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. as of december 31, 2010, the operating partnership had approximately $304 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 28% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest 23 table of contents rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. reits may pay a portion of dividends in common stock. in december 2009, the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure 2010-12, which expanded previously issued temporary guidance relating to certain stock distributions made by publicly traded reits to satisfy their tax-related distribution requirements. this expanded temporary guidance is intended to permit reits to limit cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity during the current downturn in economic conditions. under this expanded guidance, for stock dividends declared on or after january 1, 2008 and before december 31, 2012, with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december 31, 2011, the internal revenue service will treat a distribution of stock by a publicly traded reit, pursuant to certain stockholder elections to receive either stock or cash, as a taxable distribution of property, provided that, among other conditions, (i) the total amount of cash available for distribution is not less than 10% of the aggregate declared distribution, and (ii) if too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata amount of cash corresponding to its respective entitlement under the declaration, but in no event will any such electing stockholder receive less than 10% of the stockholder entire entitlement in money. the amount of such stock distribution will generally be treated as equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead. if we pay a portion of our dividends in shares of our common stock pursuant to this temporary guidance, our stockholders may receive less cash than they received in distributions in prior years and the market value of our securities may decline. 24 table of contents udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite udr qualification as a reit, its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, udr is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws. as discussed in the risk factors above, because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to our stockholders. in the normal course of business, entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits. if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership, but cannot guarantee that it will qualify. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the operating partnership admits additional limited partners other than udr, inc. if classified as a partnership, the operating partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability. however, the operating partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a publicly traded partnership, unless at least 90% of the operating partnership income was qualifying income as defined in the code. a publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose 25 table of contents partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). although the operating partnership partnership units are not traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption right, the operating partnership units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the operating partnership may not qualify for one of the safe harbors under the applicable tax regulations. qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. the operating partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax liabilities, and udr, inc. would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. risks related to our organization and ownership of udr, inc. stock changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange, on which we list udr, inc common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. in addition to the risks listed in this risk factors section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of our common stock, including: general market and economic conditions; actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends or our payment of dividends in shares of our stock; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt; decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; a change in analyst ratings; additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; speculation in the press or investment community; terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; failure to qualify as a reit; strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; 26 table of contents failure to satisfy listing requirements of the nyse; governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under our at-the-market equity distribution program. many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr common stock. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in our stockholders best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2 / 3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of our stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of our stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 67 quantitative and qualitative

administered real estate investment trust, or reit, that owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the united states. the high barrier-to-entry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction, difficult and lengthy entitlement process, expensive single-family home prices and significant employment growth potential. at december 31, 2011, our consolidated apartment portfolio included 163 communities located in 22 markets, with a total of 47,343 completed apartment homes, which are held through our operating partnerships, including the operating partnership, our subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures. in addition, we have an ownership interest in 39 communities containing 10,496 completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures. at december 31, 2011, the company is developing seven wholly-owned communities with 2,108 apartment homes, 145 of which have been completed. at december 31, 2011, the operating partnership consolidated apartment portfolio included 77 communities located in 17 markets, with a total of 23,160 completed apartment homes. the operating partnership owns, operates, acquires, renovates, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barrier-to-entry markets located throughout the united states. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2011, revenues of the operating partnership represented approximately 53% of our total rental revenues. 3 table of contents udr elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this report as the code . to continue to qualify as a reit, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. as a qualified reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. in 2011, we declared total distributions of $0.80 per common share and paid dividends of $0.77 per common share. dividends declared in dividends paid 2011 in 2011 first quarter $ 0.185 $ 0.185 second quarter 0.200 0.185 third quarter 0.200 0.200 fourth quarter 0.215 0.200 total $ 0.800 $ 0.770 udr was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation. in june 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland. the operating partnership was formed in 2004 as delaware limited partnership. the operating partnership is the successor-in-interest to united dominion realty, l.p., a limited partnership formed under the laws of virginia, which commenced operations in 1995. our corporate offices are located at 1745 shea center drive, suite 200, highlands ranch, colorado and our telephone number is (720) 283-6120. our website is located at www.udr.com

non-mature/other communities. our same communities segment includes those communities acquired, developed, and stabilized prior to january 1, 2010, and held as of december 31, 2011. these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and the community is not classified as held for sale at year end. a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90% occupancy for at least three consecutive months. our non-mature/other communities segment includes those communities that were acquired or developed in 2009, 2010 or 2011, sold properties, redevelopment properties, properties classified as real estate held for sale, condominium conversion properties, joint venture properties, properties managed by third parties, and the non-apartment components of mixed use properties. for additional information regarding our operating segments, see note 15 to udr consolidated financial statements and note 11 to the operating partnership consolidated financial statements. business objectives our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value. to achieve this objective, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies: own and operate apartments in markets that have the best growth prospects based on favorable job formation and low home affordability, thus enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our stockholders; manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating, and developing apartment communities; empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and effectively; measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets; and manage our capital structure to help enhance predictability of earnings and dividends. 4 table of contents 2011 highlights we acquired eight operating communities with 3,161 homes located in new york, new york; san francisco, california; boston, massachusetts;

facility, similar to the guarantee it issued under the prior facility. the new credit facility has an initial term of four years and includes a one-year extension option, and contains an accordion feature that allows the company to increase the facility to $1.35 billion. based on the company current credit ratings, the credit facility carries an interest rate equal to libor plus a spread of

agreement, and no material changes were made to the equity distribution agreement. as of december 31, 2011 8,150,921 shares of common stock may be sold under our equity distribution agreement. 5 table of contents we closed on a public offering of 20,700,000 shares of our common stock, including 2,700,000 shares sold as a result of the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option in full at

significant changes to the operating partnership business during 2011 (the above 2011 highlights relate to udr or other subsidiaries of udr): the operating partnership acquired four operating communities with 1,833 homes located in the new york, new york and boston, massachusetts markets for $761.2 million. in partial consideration for the acquisition of two of these communities, 4,371,845 op units were issued. the operating partnership issued a guarantee on $300 million of medium-term notes due june 2018 issued by udr. the operating partnership issued a guarantee in conjunction with a $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility entered into by udr. the facility replaced the general partner $600 million credit facility, which the operating partnership had previously guaranteed. our strategies and vision we previously announced our vision to be the innovative multifamily public real estate investment trust of choice. we identified the following strategies to guide decision-making and growth: 1. strengthen quality of our portfolio 2. grow our cash flow to support dividend growth 3. increase our balance sheet strength and flexibility 4. great place to work and live strengthen quality of our portfolio we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation, low single-family home affordability, and a favorable demand/supply ratio for multifamily housing. portfolio decisions consider internal analyses and third-party research, taking into account job growth, multifamily permitting and housing affordability. for the year ended december 31, 2011, approximately 50.9% of our same store net operating income ( noi ) was provided by our communities located in california, metropolitan washington, d.c., oregon and washington state. 6 table of contents grow our cash flow to support dividend growth acquisitions and dispositions during 2011, in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our portfolio, we acquired eight operating communities with 3,161 apartment homes for approximately $1.5 billion. four of these operating communities, representing 1,833 homes, were acquired by the operating partnership for approximately $761.2 million. when evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider: population growth, cost of alternative housing, overall potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located; geographic location, including proximity to jobs, entertainment, transportation, and our existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale; construction quality, condition and design of the community; current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow; potential for capital appreciation of the property; ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through operations and redevelopment; terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases; occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; prospects for liquidity through sale, financing, or refinancing of the property; and competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area. we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio. factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include: current market price for an asset compared to projected economics for that asset; potential increases in new construction in the market area; areas where the economy is not expected to grow substantially; markets where we do not intend to establish a long-term concentration; and operating efficiencies. during 2011, we sold eighteen apartment home communities, of which eight communities were owned by the operating partnership. the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions, apartment community dispositions

properties in targeted markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value. during the year ended december 31, 2011, we incurred $30.0 million in major renovations, which include major structural changes and/or architectural revisions to existing buildings. 8 table of contents joint venture activities consolidated joint venture in august 2011, the company invested in a consolidated joint venture with an unaffiliated third party to acquire and redevelop an existing commercial property into a 173-apartment home community in orange county, california. at closing the company contributed $9.0 million and at december 31, 2011, udr owned a 90% controlling interest in the investment. under the terms of the operating agreement, our partner is required to achieve certain criteria as it relates to the entitlement process. if the criteria are met on or before 730 days after the site plan application is deemed complete by the city, the company is obligated to contribute an additional $3.0 million to the joint venture for distribution to our partner. at the acquisition date, the company accrued and capitalized $3.0 million related to the contingent consideration, which represents the difference between fair value of the property of $9.8 million on the formation date and the estimated fair value of the underlying property upon completion of the entitlement process of $12.8 million. unconsolidated joint ventures in may 2011, the company entered into a joint venture to develop a 263-home community in san diego, california. at december 31, 2011 and at

at closing, udr owned a noncontrolling interest of 95% in the joint venture. our initial investment was $7.1 million and our investment at december 31, 2011 was $8.6 million. udr is a partner with an unaffiliated third party, which formed a joint venture for the investment of up to $450.0 million in multifamily properties located in key, high barrier to entry markets such as metropolitan washington d.c. the partners will contribute equity of $180.0 million of which the company maximum equity will be 30% or $54.0 million when fully invested. in 2011, the joint venture acquired two properties (509 homes). at december 31, 2011, the company owned a 30% interest in the joint venture. our investment at december 31, 2011 was $34.1 million. for additional information regarding these and our other joint ventures, see note 5, joint ventures to the consolidated financial statements of udr, inc. in this report. the operating partnership is not a party to any of the joint venture activities described above. 9 table of contents increase our balance sheet strength and flexibility we maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek, and not just react to, opportunities available in the marketplace. we have structured our borrowings to stagger our debt maturities and to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt. financing activities as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure, we utilized proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities, pay down existing debt and acquire apartment communities. the following is a summary of our major financing activities in 2011. we received proceeds of $30.7 million from secured debt financings. the $30.7 million includes $25.7 million in variable rate mortgages and $5.0 million in fixed rate mortgages. we repaid $336.0 million of secured debt, which includes $197.5 million of construction loans, repayment of $102.8 million of credit facilities,

drive operating efficiencies and to better meet the changing needs of our residents. since its launch in january 2009, our residents have been utilizing the resident internet portal on our website. our residents have access to conduct business with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to pay rent on line and to submit service requests. in july 2010, we completed the roll out of online renewals throughout our entire portfolio. as a result of transforming operations through technology, our residents get the convenience they want, and our operating teams have become more efficient. these improvements in adopting the web as a way to conduct business with us have also resulted in a decline in marketing and advertising costs, improved cash management, and improved capabilities to better manage pricing of our available apartment homes. in 2011, udr.com features and functionality were enhanced to increase user engagement and increase lead volume year-over-year, such as, improved photography, enhancements to the online web forms and improved layout of the individual udr community homepages. in addition to improvements to www.udr.com , we also improved our suite of mobile and tablet devices on the iphone, ipad and android platforms. these overall enhancements have contributed to increasing our web visitor traffic to almost 3.1 million visitors (up 31%), almost 2.1 million organic search engine visitors (up 38%), mobile traffic increased 112%, mobile leads generated increased 115% and mobile as a percent of total web traffic was at 22% in q4 2011. overall, the udr.com and mobile initiatives contributed to a 17% year-over-year lead stream increase. 10 table of contents operating partnership strategies and vision the operating partnership long-term strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer, more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology. as a result, the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in new york, new york; san francisco, california; boston, massachusetts; and metropolitan d.c. markets over the past years. prospectively, we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns. markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth, low single-family home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing- three key drivers to strong rental growth. markets and competitive conditions at december 31, 2011, 50.9% of our consolidated same store net operating income and 72.4% of the operating partnership same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes located in california, metropolitan washington d.c., oregon, and washington state. we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings. competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets. some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have. competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. also, some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities. the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including sub-market supply and demand. in addition, other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, public and private real estate companies, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, some of which may have greater resources, or lower capital costs, than we do. we believe that, in general, we are well-positioned to compete effectively for residents and investments. we believe our competitive advantages include: a fully integrated organization with property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, marketing, sales and financing expertise; scalable operating and support systems, which include automated systems to meet the changing electronic needs of our residents and to effectively focus on our internet marketing efforts; purchasing power; geographic diversification with a presence in 22 markets across the country; and significant presence in many of our major markets that allows us to be a local operating expert. moving forward, we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management, improved expense control, increased resident retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance. we believe this plan of operation, coupled with the portfolio strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform, should position us for continued operational improvement in spite of the difficult economic environment. communities at december 31, 2011, our apartment portfolio included 163 consolidated communities having a total of 47,343 completed apartment homes and an additional 1,963 apartment homes under development, which included the operating partnership apartment portfolio of 77 consolidated communities having a total of 23,160 completed apartment homes. the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb expenses, such as water and sewer costs, from the landlord to the resident. in addition, it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home, and therefore should result in increased cash flow in the future. at december 31, 2011, the company is developing seven wholly-owned communities with 2,108 apartment homes, 145 of which have been completed. at december 31, 2011, the company is redeveloping seven wholly-owned communities with 3,123 apartment homes, 467 of which have been completed. same store community comparison we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same store community net operating income, which is total rental revenue, less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses. our same store community population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy, revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. 11 table of contents for the year ended december 31, 2011, our same store noi increased by $18.1 million or 5.6% compared to the prior year. the increase in noi for the 37,869 apartment homes which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and decreased occupancy. for the year ended december 31, 2011, the operating partnership same store noi increased by $11.5 million or 6.2% compared to the prior year. the increase in noi for the 19,194 apartment homes which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in revenue rental rates, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and decreased occupancy. revenue growth in 2012 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy, reduced occupancy rates, increased rental concessions, increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents. tax matters udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. to continue to qualify as a reit, udr must continue to meet certain tests that, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (other than net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. provided we maintain our qualification as a reit, we generally will not be subject to u.s. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may utilize taxable reit subsidiaries to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing, including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions. taxable reit subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular corporations and therefore are subject to federal, state and local income taxes. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability. however, any state or local revenue, excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level. inflation we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial. while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures, utilities and material costs, substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes. although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2011. environmental matters various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities. such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, management of surfaces with lead-based paint (and notices to residents about the lead-based paint), use of active underground petroleum storage tanks, and waste-management activities. the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action and/or claims for damages by a private party. to date, compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. we have a property management plan for hazardous materials. as part of the plan, phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire. in addition, all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition. the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants, and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property. nevertheless, it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities, or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware. in some cases, we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved. we do not believe we will be required to engage in any large-scale abatement at any of our properties. we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos, lead paint and other hazardous materials, coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk, we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards. 12 table of contents federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification. in addition, lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested, and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities. we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position. we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and we are not otherwise aware, of any material non-compliance, liability, or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties. we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations. future environmental laws, regulations, or ordinances, however, may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable. also, if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition. insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. we are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. executive officers of the company udr is the sole general partner of the operating

company and the operating partnership, some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership. the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily market and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, the downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments and real estate taxes, generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; our ability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms; the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; declines in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. continued economic weakness following the economic recession that the u.s. economy recently experienced may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the u.s. economy continues to experience weakness following a severe recession, which has resulted in increased unemployment, decreased consumer spending and a decline in residential and commercial property values. although it is not clear whether the u.s. economy has fully emerged from the recession, high levels of unemployment have continued to persist. if the economic recovery slows or stalls, we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels, our rental revenues and the value of our properties, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. substantial international, national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. the values of, and the cash flows from, the properties we own are affected by developments in global, national and local economies. as a result of the recent recession and the significant government interventions, federal, state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities. these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal, state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending, tax increases, public sector job losses, increased interest rates, currency devaluations or other adverse economic events, which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 15 table of contents risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. neither inflation nor deflation has materially impacted our operations in the recent past. the general risk of inflation is that our debt interest and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate higher than our rental rates. the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties. high unemployment may have a negative effect on our occupancy levels and our rental revenues. we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities: a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single-and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition; even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete; 16 table of contents an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure related to the acquired property may go undetected during our due diligence procedures; when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other public and private apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect growth. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than pro forma; if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. 17 table of contents in some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. bankruptcy of developers in our development joint ventures could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the development of our communities and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the bankruptcy of one of the developers in any of our development joint ventures could materially and adversely affect the relevant property or properties. if the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a property has incurred recourse obligations, the discharge in bankruptcy of the developer may require us to honor a completion guarantee and therefore might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than we would otherwise bear. property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. if we use such a structure, we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr stockholders. as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which can be widely outside of our control. we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect. the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted resulting in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. in addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; inability to hire and retain key personnel; lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and inability to achieve budgeted financial results. 18 table of contents potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks. noncompliance with these environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability. changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws, health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance. this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations. as the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. for example, buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain, may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing material, or acm. environmental, health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners, operators or employers for non-compliance with those requirements. these requirements include special precautions, such as removal, abatement or air monitoring, if acm would be disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition of a building, potentially resulting in substantial costs. in addition, we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment. we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation. when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. 19 table of contents real estate tax and other laws. generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. risk of damage from catastrophic weather events. certain of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults, mudslides and fires, and others where there are hurricanes, tornadoes or risks of other inclement weather. the adverse weather events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr common stock. a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under gaap if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. if such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future, these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and the per share trading price of udr common stock. any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr stock price. our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures. despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failures. we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and keeping of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber attacks. security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us. our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service is not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 20 table of contents we may be adversely affected by new laws and regulations. the united states administration and congress have enacted, or called for consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues, including with respect to health care, financial regulation reform, climate control, executive compensation and others. we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material. at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us. certain rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the recent economic downturn. these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression. the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21, 2010 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd-frank act ). many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. the dodd-frank act, including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable. changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular, including certain provisions of the dodd-frank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the u.s. public markets. because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure, our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. the adoption of derivatives legislation by congress could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business. the dodd-frank act regulates derivative transactions, which include certain instruments used in our risk management activities. the dodd-frank act contemplates that most swaps will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility. there are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. while we may ultimately be eligible for such exceptions, the scope of these exceptions is currently uncertain, pending further definition through rulemaking proceedings. although the dodd-frank act includes significant new provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives, the impact of those requirements will not be known definitively until regulations have been adopted by the sec and the commodities futures trading commission. the new legislation and any new regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available hedge counterparties to us. changes in the system for establishing u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ( gaap ). gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board (the fasb ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. the international accounting standards board (the iasb ) is a london-based independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards ( ifrs ). ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world. ifrs differs in material respects from gaap. among other things, ifrs has historically relied more on fair value models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap. fair value models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities, often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap, which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation. 21 table of contents we are monitoring the sec activity with respect to the proposed adoption of ifrs by united states public companies. it is unclear at this time how the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted. in addition, switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs will be a complex undertaking. we may need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs. since these are new endeavors, and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately to be adopted are not now known, the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain. we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations. such evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that will be adopted. until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards to be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations. risks related to our indebtedness and financings insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr stockholders. failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; competition from other apartment communities; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing. expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. our debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. 22 table of contents financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. moody and standard poor s, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr stock. our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. during the past few years, the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing. the recent downgrade of the u.s. credit rating by standard poor and the ongoing european debt crisis have contributed to the instability in global credit markets. continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our business. additionally, due to this uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr common or preferred stock. the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of udr common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business. prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels. tightening of credit in financial markets and high unemployment rates may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis. disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy. a change in u.s. government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business. fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate. we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans. in september 2008, the u.s. government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency. the administration has proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the u.s. that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets. uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 23 table of contents changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2011, udr had approximately $1.1 billion of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 28% of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. as of december 31, 2011, the operating partnership had approximately $287.0 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 24% of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of udr common and preferred stock and debt securities. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit. udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. reits may pay a portion of dividends in common stock. in december 2009, the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure 2010-12, which expanded previously issued temporary guidance relating to certain stock distributions made by publicly traded reits to satisfy their tax-related distribution requirements. this expanded temporary guidance is intended to permit reits to limit cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity during the current downturn in economic conditions. under this expanded guidance, for stock dividends declared on or after january 1, 2008 and before december 31, 2012, with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december 31, 2011, the internal revenue service will treat a distribution of stock by a publicly traded reit, pursuant to certain stockholder elections to receive either stock or cash, as a taxable distribution of property, provided that, among other conditions, (i) the total amount of cash available for distribution is not less than 10% of the aggregate declared distribution, and (ii) if too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata amount of cash corresponding to its respective entitlement under the declaration, but in no event will any such electing stockholder receive less than 10% of the stockholder entire entitlement in money. the amount of such stock distribution will generally be treated as equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead. if we pay a portion of our dividends in shares of udr common stock pursuant to this temporary guidance, udr stockholders may receive less cash than they received in distributions in prior years and the market value of our securities may decline. 24 table of contents dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. in general, the maximum u.s. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual u.s. shareholders is 15% (through 2012). unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit, our distributions to individual shareholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite udr qualification as a reit, its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, udr is subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to udr stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws. as discussed in the risk factors above, because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but it is subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr stockholders. in the normal course of business, entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits. if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 25 table of contents the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership, but cannot guarantee that it will qualify. the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the operating partnership admits additional limited partners other than udr. if classified as a partnership, the operating partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability. however, the operating partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a publicly traded partnership, unless at least 90% of the operating partnership income was qualifying income as defined in the code. a publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). although the operating partnership partnership units are not traded on an established securities market, because of the redemption right, the operating partnership units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), and the operating partnership may not qualify for one of the safe harbors under the applicable tax regulations. qualifying income for the 90% test generally includes passive income, such as real property rents, dividends and interest. the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90% test are similar in most respects. the operating partnership may not meet this qualifying income test. if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation, it would incur substantial tax liabilities, and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes, unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions, and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired. qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code. our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification. moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit. our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. in addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. risks related to our organization and ownership of udr stock changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange ( nyse ), on which we list udr common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of udr common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in udr common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. in addition to the risks listed in this risk factors section, a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr common stock, including: general market and economic conditions; actual or anticipated variations in udr quarterly operating results or dividends or udr payment of dividends in shares of udr stock; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance existing debt; decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of udr stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; a change in analyst ratings; 26 table of contents additions or departures of key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; speculation in the press or investment community; terrorist activity which may adversely affect the markets in which udr securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; failure to qualify as a reit; strategic decisions by us or by our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; failure to satisfy listing requirements of the nyse; governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and the issuance of additional shares of udr common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, including under udr at-the-market equity distribution program. many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. we may change the dividend policy for udr common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr common stock. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in udr stockholders best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in udr stockholders best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2 / 3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. 27 table of contents limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. absent such an exemption from our board of directors, the transfer of udr stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, will be considered null and void, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr stockholders or might otherwise be in udr stockholders best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 66 quantitative and qualitative disclosures

this report.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 39 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in and incorporated by reference from item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report.risk factors 13 risk factors there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made. unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates. market and economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and, therefore, our profitability. factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following: a reduction in jobs and other local economic downturns, declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable, government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing decisions easier to make, oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes, declines in household formation, and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. 13 table of contents the strength of the united states economy has become increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of terrorism. at the same time, productivity enhancements and the increased exportation of labor have resulted in limited job growth despite an improving economy. continued weakness in job creation, or any worsening of current economic conditions, generally and in our principal market areas, could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy levels, our rental rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities. this may impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our stockholders. new acquisitions, developments and condominium projects may not achieve anticipated results. we intend to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment criteria and to develop apartment communities for rental operations, to convert properties into condominiums and to develop condominium projects. our acquisition, development and condominium activities and their success are subject to the following risks: an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure related to the acquired property may go undetected during our due diligence procedures, when we acquire an apartment community, we often invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability. these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability, new developments may not achieve pro forma rents or occupancy levels, or problems with construction or local building codes may delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and an over supply of condominiums in a given market may cause a decrease in the prices at which we expect to sell condominium properties or cause us to be unable to sell condominium properties. possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but market conditions could change and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us. a weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions. furthermore, a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales. in addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. additionally, we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in 14 table of contents addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and increase our financing costs. failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies, local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes, tenants perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located, our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance, and rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities. expenses associated with our investment in a community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, or on favorable terms or at all. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. we intend to continue to develop and construct apartment communities. development activities may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations, if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited, we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities, we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs, 15 table of contents occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community, and when we sell to third parties homes or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets, and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have, in some cases, exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. some potential losses are not covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses for which we may not have insurance. accordingly, we may sustain uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. we may not be able to renew insurance coverage in an adequate amount or at reasonable prices. in addition, insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and mold, or, if offered, these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to stockholders. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we may from time to time make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies, inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, inability to hire and retain key personnel, and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2007, we had approximately $522.1 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 15% of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. limited investment opportunities could adversely affect our growth. we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other apartment reits. this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely 16 table of contents pursue, and our competitors may have greater resources than we do. as a result, we may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our growth. failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies. to grow successfully, we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties. in addition, we must be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity. failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. we would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit. we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we first failed to qualify. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite our qualification as a reit, our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must 17 table of contents comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm length in nature or are otherwise not respected. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the internal revenue code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange, on which we list our common shares, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. if we use such a structure, we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. 18 table of contents real estate tax and other laws. generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. risk of damage from catastrophic weather events. certain of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults, mudslides and fires, and others where there are hurricanes, tornadoes or risks of other inclement weather. the adverse weather events could cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. insurance coverage for such catastrophic events is expensive due to limited industry capacity. as a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available. terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal report over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in our stockholders best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2 / 3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the internal revenue code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other 19 table of contents reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. these provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 42 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in and incorporated by reference from item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report.risk factors 12 risk factors there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made. risks related to our real estate investments and our operations unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels, rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets. unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms. some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments and real estate taxes, generally do not decline when related rents decline. we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities. factors that may affect our occupancy levels, our rental revenues, and/or the value of our properties include the following, among others: downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly increases in unemployment; declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable; government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive; local real estate market conditions, including oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes; declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants; changes in market rental rates; the timing and costs associated with property improvements, repairs or renovations; declines in household formation; and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. 12 table of contents we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility. we have periodically disposed of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own, and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities: a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales; federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable; further in march 2008, we sold a portfolio of properties for total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion, including a note receivable in the amount of $200 million. the note is secured by a pledge, security agreement and a guarantee by the buyer parent entity. if we fail to receive payment on this note, or if the payment of the note is delayed, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. we may not have access to proceeds obtained from the sale of apartment communities . a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales. in addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies. we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs; an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure related to the acquired property may go undetected during our due diligence procedures; when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment 13 table of contents communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. we do not expect to acquire apartment communities at the rate we have in prior years, which may limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business and the market value of our securities. in the past, other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other apartment reits, have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties, and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms, which could adversely affect growth. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities, and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise. development activities have been, and in the future may be, conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain construction financing for development activities under favorable terms, including but not limited to interest rates, maturity dates and/or loan to value ratios, or at all which could cause us to delay or even abandon potential developments; we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations; if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited; we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities; we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs; occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. in some cases in the past, the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance. we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities. we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. in addition, we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our 14 table of contents significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, apartment communities that are outside of our existing market. entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies; inability to hire and retain key personnel; lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and inability to achieve budgeted financial results. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. although inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our debt interest and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rental rates. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. if we use such a structure, we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. 15 table of

operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price. our success depends on our senior management. our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, whose continued service in not guaranteed. we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us. the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. risks related to our indebtedness and financing insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. additionally, we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. in addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and increase our financing costs. 16 table of contents failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies; local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes; tenants perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance; rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities; changes in interest rates and the availability of financing; and changes in tax and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing. expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. financing could be impacted by negative capital market conditions. recently, domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty. while this condition has occurred most visibly within the subprime mortgage lending sector of the credit market, liquidity has tightened in overall domestic financial markets, including the investment grade debt and equity capital markets. consequently, there is greater risk that the financial institutions we do business with could experience disruptions that would negatively affect our ability to obtain financing. disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit, impact our tenant base, and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our stock. our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. the united states stock and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing. continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions, development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our business. additionally, due 17 table of contents to this uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms, which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations. a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common or preferred stock. the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business. prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels. current tightening of credit in financial markets and increasing unemployment may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis. disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy. the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us. we have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, could result in losses or defaults by these institutions. in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2008, we had approximately $345.7 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 10.5% of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. risks related to tax laws we would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit. we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws 18 table of contents governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we first failed to qualify. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. reits may pay a portion of dividends in common stock. in december 2008, the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure 2008-68, providing temporary guidance that assists publicly traded reits in satisfying their tax-related distribution requirements while conserving cash. this temporary guidance is intended to permit reits to limit cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity during the current downturn in economic conditions. under this guidance, effective january 1, 2008 and ending on or before december 31, 2009, the internal revenue service will treat a distribution of stock by a publicly traded reit, pursuant to certain elections to receive stock or cash, as a taxable distribution of property. the amount of such stock distribution will be treated as equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead. the guidance permits reits to limit the aggregate amount of cash available to stockholders pursuant to the election to 10% of the aggregate distribution of cash and stock taken together. if we pay a portion of our dividends in shares of our common stock pursuant to this temporary guidance, our stockholders may receive less cash than they received in distributions in prior years and the market value of our securities may decline. we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite our qualification as a reit, our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm length in nature or are otherwise not respected. reit distribution requirements limit our available cash. as a reit, we are subject to annual distribution requirements, which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net reit taxable income, excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax. we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code. however, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the code. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the internal revenue code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment 19 table of contents purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws. as discussed in the risk factors above, because we are organized and qualify as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. from time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to our stockholders. in the normal course of business, entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits. if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits, the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. risks related to our organization and our shares changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange, on which we list our common shares, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in our stockholders best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2 / 3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the internal revenue code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. these provisions may have the effect of 20 table of contents delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders best interests. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 45 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in and incorporated by reference from item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report. 45 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 40 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in and incorporated by reference from item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report.risk factors 11 risk factors there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates. market and economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and, therefore, our profitability. factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following: a reduction in jobs and other local economic downturns, declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable, government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing decisions easier to make, oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes, declines in household formation, and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. the strength of the united states economy has become increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of terrorism. at the same time, productivity enhancements and the increased exportation of labor have resulted in limited job growth despite an improving economy. continued weakness in job creation, or any worsening of current economic conditions, generally and in our principal market areas, could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy levels, our rental rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities. this may impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our stockholders. new acquisitions, developments and condominium projects may not achieve anticipated results. we intend to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment criteria and to develop apartment communities for rental operations, to convert properties into condominiums and to develop condominium projects. our acquisition, development and condominium activities and their success are subject to the following risks: an acquired community may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure related to the acquired property may go undetected during our due diligence procedures, 11 table of contents when we acquire an apartment community, we often invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability. these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability, new developments may not achieve pro forma rents or occupancy levels, or problems with construction or local building codes may delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and an over supply of condominiums in a given market may cause a decrease in the prices at which we expect to sell condominium properties. possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but market conditions could change and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us. a weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions. furthermore, a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales. in addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. additionally, we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies, local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes, tenants perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located, our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance, and rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities. expenses associated with our investment in a community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that 12 table of contents community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, or on favorable terms or at all. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. we intend to continue to develop and construct apartment communities. development activities may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations, if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited, we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities, we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs, occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community, and when we sell to third parties homes or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets, and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have, in some cases, exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we may from time to time make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies, 13 table of contents inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, inability to hire and retain key personnel, and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2005, we had approximately $578 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 18% of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged effectively, and it would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities. limited investment opportunities could adversely affect our growth . we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other apartment reits. this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue, and our competitors may have greater resources than we do. as a result, we may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our growth. failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies. to grow successfully, we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties. in addition, we must be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity. failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. we would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit. we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders. 14 table of contents if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we first failed to qualify. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries. despite our qualification as a reit, our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm length in nature or are otherwise not respected. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the internal revenue code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in our stockholders best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the internal revenue code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this requirement. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits a person from beneficially owning or constructively owning shares of our outstanding equity stock in excess of a 9.9% ownership interest, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our 15 table of contents outstanding equity stock. these provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders best interests. under the terms of our shareholder rights plan, our board of directors can, in effect, prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. unless our board of directors approves the person purchase, after that person acquires more than 15% of our outstanding common stock, all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value. purchases by other stockholders would substantially reduce the value and influence of the shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person. our board of directors, however, can prevent the shareholder rights plan from operating in this manner. this gives our board of directors significant discretion to approve or disapprove a person efforts to acquire a large interest in us. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 37 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in and incorporated by reference from item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report.risk factors 11 risk factors there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results, operations and business prospects. except as required 11 table of contents by law, we undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made. unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates. market and economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and, therefore, our profitability. factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following: a reduction in jobs and other local economic downturns, declines in mortgage interest rates, making alternative housing more affordable, government or builder incentives which enable first time homebuyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing decisions easier to make, oversupply of, or reduced demand for, apartment homes, declines in household formation, and rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. the strength of the united states economy has become increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of terrorism. at the same time, productivity enhancements and the increased exportation of labor have resulted in limited job growth despite an improving economy. continued weakness in job creation, or any worsening of current economic conditions, generally and in our principal market areas, could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy levels, our rental rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities. this may impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our stockholders. new acquisitions, developments and condominium projects may not achieve anticipated results. we intend to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment criteria and to develop apartment communities for rental operations, to convert properties into condominiums and to develop condominium projects. our acquisition, development and condominium activities and their success are subject to the following risks: an acquired apartment community may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment, or a significant exposure related to the acquired property may go undetected during our due diligence procedures, when we acquire an apartment community, we often invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability. these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability, new developments may not achieve pro forma rents or occupancy levels, or problems with construction or local building codes may delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and an over supply of condominiums in a given market may cause a decrease in the prices at which we expect to sell condominium properties. possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit operational and financial flexibility. we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives. market conditions could change and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us. a weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions. furthermore, a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales. in addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale 12 table of contents of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable. increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents. our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other apartment communities and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single- and multi-family homes. competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk. we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints. sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants. additionally, we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures. we may not be able to refinance existing debt, or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt, which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so. failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders. if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses, our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities: the national and local economies, local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply of apartment homes, tenants perceptions of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located, our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance, and rental expenses, including real estate taxes and utilities. expenses associated with our investment in a community, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community. if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder. debt level may be increased. our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur, although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements. we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants, but subject to compliance with these covenants, we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt. financing may not be available and could be dilutive. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, on favorable terms or at all. if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt, the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted. development and construction risks could impact our profitability. we intend to continue to develop and construct apartment communities. development activities may be conducted through wholly owned 13 table of contents affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks: we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations, if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for the developments, our development capacity may be limited, we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities, we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs, occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community, and when we sell homes or properties that we developed or renovated to third parties, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect claims that are uninsured or exceed the limits of our insurance. construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets, and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have, in some cases, exceeded our original estimates. we may experience similar cost increases in the future. our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability. some potential losses are not covered by insurance. we maintain insurance policies covering our property and operating activities which are of the type and in amounts we believe are reasonable and appropriate to cover our business. there are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses for which we may not have insurance, including certain extraordinary losses resulting from environmental damage or successive natural disasters or other catastrophes. accordingly, we may sustain uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties, or losses in excess of applicable coverage. we may not be able to renew insurance coverage in an adequate amount or at reasonable prices. in addition, insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and mold, or, if offered, these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. in such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future. if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to stockholders. failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth. we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets, and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets. these risks include, among others: inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and local economies, inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, inability to hire and retain key personnel, and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. 14 table of contents changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities. we currently have, and expect to incur in the future, interest-bearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates. as of december 31, 2006, we had approximately $492.5 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding, which constitutes approximately 15% of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date. an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged effectively, and it would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities. risk of inflation/deflation. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. limited investment opportunities could adversely affect our growth. we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. these competitors include insurance companies, pension and investment funds, developer partnerships, investment companies and other apartment reits. this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue, and our competitors may have greater resources than we do. as a result, we may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our growth. failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies. to grow successfully, we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties. in addition, we must be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity. failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability. interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges. from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs. also, from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates. if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of, or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract, the contract is ineffective. furthermore, the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges. potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, as a current or former owner or operator of real estate, we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances, often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate. in addition, we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. these costs could be substantial, and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment. the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. we would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit. we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit, but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future. in addition, u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any 15 table of contents time, potentially with retroactive effect. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, and applicable relief provisions under the code were not available, we would be subject to u.s. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income. also, unless the internal revenue service, or irs, granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we first failed to qualify. the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital. in addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. even if we continue to qualify as a reit, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries, which are subject to certain tax risks. we have established taxable reit subsidiaries in which we conduct a portion of our business. despite our qualification as a reit, our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income. in addition, we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests. while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification, we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales, or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm length in nature or are otherwise not respected. certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the irs may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange, on which we list our common shares, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest. we have in the past and expect in the future to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. as a result, we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, joint venture partners may have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. 16 table of contents real estate tax and other laws. generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. we also do not generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. similarly, compliance with or changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing, such as the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and the fair housing amendments act of 1988, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal report over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price. maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which may not be in our stockholders best interests. maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. as a maryland corporation, we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders best interests. the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10% or more of the voting power without our board of directors prior approval. any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2 / 3 % of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10% (and certain higher levels) of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders. one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals, including entities specified in the code, during the last half of any taxable year. our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements; however, the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control, which does not threaten reit status. these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 9.9% of the value of our outstanding equity stock, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation, provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13% of the value of our outstanding equity stock. these provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders best interests. under the terms of our shareholder rights plan, our board of directors can, in effect, prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. unless our board of directors approves the person purchase, after that person acquires more than 15% of our outstanding common stock, all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value. purchases by other stockholders would substantially reduce the value and influence of the shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person. our board of directors, however, can prevent the shareholder rights plan from operating in this manner. this gives our board of directors significant discretion to approve or disapprove a person efforts to acquire a large interest in us. additional information regarding our shareholder rights plan is set forth in note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this report. 17 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 40 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about
