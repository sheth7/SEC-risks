risk factors 20 risk factors forward-looking statements and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 certain matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management's plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, seeks, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, intends, might, goals, objectives, targets, planned, potential, projects, scheduled, will, assumes, guidance, outlook, in service date, or other similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding: amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; financial condition and liquidity; business strategy; cash flow from operations or results of operations; the levels of dividends to stockholders; natural gas, natural gas liquids and olefins supply, prices and demand; demand for our services. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: whether we have sufficient cash to enable us to pay current and expected levels of dividends; availability of supplies, market demand, and volatility of prices; inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers); the strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition; whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate and execute investment opportunities; 20 ability to acquire new businesses and assets and successfully integrate those operations and assets into our existing businesses, as well as successfully expand our facilities; development of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and development hazards and unforeseen interruptions; costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations (including safety and environmental regulations), environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings; our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in maintenance and construction costs; changes in the current geopolitical situation; our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties; risks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements, future changes in our credit ratings and the availability and cost of capital; the amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate; risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions; acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions; additional risks described in our filings with the sec. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. prices for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain our existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil or other commodities, and the differences between prices 21 of these commodities. price volatility can impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. price volatility can also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the markets for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, olefins, oil, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and quantity of foreign imports of natural gas and oil; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold. the long-term financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, and demand for those supplies in our traditional markets. our ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties in our supply basins. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. in addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital could adversely affect the development and production of additional natural gas reserves, the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities and the import and export of natural gas supplies. the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation and processing facilities. demand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils or nuclear energy could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth. as part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. we recently implemented our project lifecycle process and refocused our investment evaluation process. these are processes we use to identify, evaluate and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. we may not always 22 have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. if we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner. our growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines and facilities, ngl transportation, fractionation or storage facilities or olefins processing facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities. we also face all the risks associated with construction. these risks include the inability to obtain skilled labor, equipment, materials, permits, rights-of-way and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed on time and the risk that construction cost overruns could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that: changing circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact our investment analysis, including our projections of revenues, earnings and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes which are materially different than anticipated; we could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets. we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate; acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures; acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, either by the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access capital markets or obtain acceptable terms. if realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, and could also have an adverse impact on our financial position or cash flows. we do not own all of the interests in the partially owned entities, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and control these assets in a manner beneficial to us. because we do not control the partially owned entities, we may have limited flexibility to control the operation of or cash distributions received from these entities. the partially owned entities' organizational documents require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis; however, in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating the businesses. at december 31, 2013, our investments in the partially owned entities accounted for approximately 16 percent of our total consolidated assets. conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our partially owned entities, on the other hand, with regard to our partially owned entities' governance, business and operations. if a conflict of interest arises between us and a partially owned entity, other owners may control the partially owned entity's actions with respect to such matter (subject to certain limitations), which could be detrimental to our business. any future disagreements with the other co-owners of these assets could adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic or industry conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. holders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount identified in guidance or any dividends. we may not have sufficient cash flow each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. the actual amount of cash we dividend will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the amount of cash that wpz, our other subsidiaries and the partially owned entities distribute to us; the amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow; 23 the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements; the cost of acquisitions, if any. a failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage and a decrease in the value of our stock price. our cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of wpz. our partnership interest, including the general partner's holding of incentive distribution rights, in wpz is our largest cash-generating asset. therefore, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of wpz to make distributions to its partners. a significant decline in wpz's earnings and/or distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us. our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. some of our competitors are large oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater access to supplies of natural gas and ngls than we do. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. similarly, a highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. as a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. failure to successfully compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow. we rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and ngls. although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts or add additional customers, each on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay distributions could be adversely affected. our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative fuel sources, such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy; natural gas, ngl, and olefins prices, demand, availability and margins in our markets. higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. also, lower energy commodity prices could result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems; general economic, financial markets and industry conditions; the effects of regulation on us, our customers and our contracting practices; 24 our ability to understand our customers' expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services and effectively manage customer relationships. the results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market. our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions. there are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation and storage of ngls, processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including: aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), ngls, brine or industrial chemicals; collapse or failure of storage caverns; operator error; damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; pollution and other environmental risks; fires, explosions, craterings and blowouts; truck and rail loading and unloading; operating in a marine environment. any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage and substantial losses to us. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. an event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. we do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. we currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $610 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate with a $2 million per occurrence deductible. this insurance covers us, our subsidiaries, and certain of our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. this excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and ngl operations. although we maintain property insurance on certain physical assets that we own, lease or are responsible to insure, the policy may not cover the full replacement cost of all damaged assets or the entire amount of business interruption loss we may experience. in addition, certain perils may be excluded from coverage or be sub-limited. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. we may elect to self insure a portion of our risks. we do not insure our onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at certain locations such as river crossings and compressor stations. offshore assets are covered for property damage when loss 25 is due to a named windstorm event, but coverage for loss caused by a named windstorm is significantly sub-limited and subject to a large deductible. all of our insurance is subject to deductibles. in addition, to the insurance coverage described above, we are a member of oil insurance limited (oil), an energy industry mutual insurance company, which provides coverage for damage to our property. as an insured member of oil, we share in the losses among other oil members even if our property is not damaged. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and our ability to repay our debt. the time required to return wpz's geismar olefins plant to operation following the explosion and fire at the facility on june 13, 2013, and the extent and timing of costs and insurance recoveries related to the incident could be materially different than we anticipate and could cause our financial results and levels of dividends to be materially different than we project. our projections of financial results and expected levels of dividends are based on numerous assumptions and estimates, including but not limited to the time required to return wpz's geismar, louisiana, olefins plant to operation and complete the expansion project at the facility following the explosion and fire at the plant on june 13, 2013, and the extent and timing of costs and insurance recoveries related to the incident. our financial results and levels of dividends could be materially different than we project if our assumptions and estimates related to the incident are materially different than actual outcomes. our assets and operations, as well as our customers' assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers' assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. a significant disruption in our or our customers' operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. given the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. a terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport or distribute natural gas, ngls or other commodities. acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions. we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices and protocols, we face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants and assets. we could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, hacktivists, or private individuals. the age, operating systems or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. we 26 could also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud or unethical conduct, could result in damage to our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability or the loss of contracts, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and results of operations. the natural gas sales, transportation and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. in addition to regulation by other federal, state and local regulatory authorities, under the natural gas act of 1938, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. federal regulation extends to such matters as: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms, types of services and conditions of service; certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas. regulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business. our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities and expenditures that could exceed expectations. our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. substantial costs, liabilities, delays and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation and storage of ngls, processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices. failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations and delays in granting permits. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages 27 for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. in addition, climate change regulations and the costs associated with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs ) have the potential to affect our business. regulatory actions by the epa or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage our ghg compliance program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. climate change and ghg regulation could also reduce demand for our services. if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. the operation of our businesses might also be adversely affected by changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could 28 damage our reputation. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. in addition, existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us, our facilities or our customers. if new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional levels of reporting, regulation or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process and treat could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected. certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis. revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited term. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations. our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. in addition, financial markets have recently been affected by concerns over u.s. fiscal policy, including uncertainty regarding federal spending and tax policy, as well as the u.s. federal government's debt ceiling and the federal deficit. these concerns, as well as actions taken by the u.s. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and u.s. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manners described above. 29 a downgrade of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business. a downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. in addition, our ability to access capital markets could be limited by a downgrade of our credit ratings as well as by economic, market or other disruptions. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. this analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and our credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk. we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off doubtful accounts. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. restrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility. our total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of december 31, 2013, was $ 11,354 million . the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. in addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our and our material subsidiaries' ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. our debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. for example, they could: make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness; impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes; diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes or other purposes; 30 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. in addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and liquidity . institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility or with our former employees might not be adequately preserved. we expect that a significant percentage of employees will become eligible for retirement over the next three years. in certain areas of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. as these employees reach retirement age or their services are no longer available to us, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. our hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used and may in the future use fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract's counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. the adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities. in july 2010, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (dodd-frank act) was enacted. the dodd-frank act provides for statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including oil and gas hedging transactions. among other things, the dodd-frank act provides for the creation of position limits for certain derivatives transactions, as well as requiring certain transactions to be transacted on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required. these new rules and regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts or reduce the availability of derivatives. although we believe the derivative contracts that we enter into should not be impacted by position limits and should to a large extent be exempt from the requirement to trade these transactions on exchanges and to clear these transactions through a central clearing house or to post collateral, the impact upon our businesses will depend on the 31 outcome of the implementing regulations that are continuing to be adopted by the commodities futures trading commission. a number of our financial derivative transactions used for hedging purposes are currently executed on exchanges and cleared through clearing houses that already require the posting of margins based on initial and variation requirements. final rules promulgated under the dodd-frank act may require us to post additional cash or new margin to the clearing house or to our counterparties in connection with our hedging transactions. posting such additional cash collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our cash available for capital expenditures or other corporate purposes. a requirement to post cash collateral could therefore reduce our ability to execute hedges to reduce commodity price uncertainty and thus protect cash flows. if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the dodd-frank act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, williams partners l.p. as such, this subsidiary's operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz, a publicly traded limited partnership. this subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to wpz as the general partner and to the limited partners of wpz. activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. our control of the general partner of wpz may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise between wpz, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner's affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material. our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects. we currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the united states. the economic, political and legal conditions and regulatory environment in the countries in which we have interests or in which we might pursue acquisition or investment opportunities present risks that are different from or greater than those in the united states. these risks include, among others, delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, including with respect to the prices we realize for the commodities we produce and sell. the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain nonrecourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments. operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. in certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to u.s. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. in addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. in such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. we may or may 32 not put contracts in place designed to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. we have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations. failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the united states. service provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx energy, inc (wpx) stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying an irs private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities. in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities. the spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements that we did not assume in our agreements with wpx. the spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. a court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. under the separation and distribution agreement between us and wpx, from and after the spin-off, each of wpx and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which each owns and operates. although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to wpx, particularly if wpx were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 75 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. any borrowings under our credit facilities and any issuances under wpz's commercial paper program could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. (see note 13 debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2013 and 2012 . long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2013 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: (2) fixed rate $ $ 750 $ 375 $ 785 $ 500 $ 8,943 $ 11,353 $ 11,971 interest rate 5.5 % 5.6 % 5.6 % 5.5 % 5.4 % 6.0 % variable rate (3) $ 225 $ $ $ $ $ $ 225 $ 225 interest rate (4) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2012 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: (2) fixed rate $ $ $ 750 $ 375 $ 785 $ 8,449 $ 10,359 $ 12,013 interest rate 5.5 % 5.5 % 5.6 % 5.7 % 5.6 % 6.0 % variable rate $ $ $ $ 375 $ $ $ 375 $ 375 interest rate (4) __________________ (1) includes unamortized discount and premium. (2) excludes capital leases. (3) consists of commercial paper. (4) the weighted average interest rate was 0.42 percent and 2.7 percent at december 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of ngls, olefins, and natural gas, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and energy commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts, and limited proprietary trading activities. our management of the risks associated with these market fluctuations includes maintaining a conservative capital structure and significant liquidity, as well as using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors, including changes in energy commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. at 75 december 31, 2013 and 2012, our derivative activity was not material. (see note 16 fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.) foreign currency risk our foreign operations, whose functional currency is the local currency, are located primarily in canada. net assets of our foreign operations were approximately $1.12 billion and $899 million at december 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. these investments have the potential to impact our financial position due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the respective functional currencies against the u.s. dollar would have changed total stockholders' equity by approximately $224 million at december 31, 2013 . 76risk factors 21 risk factors forward-looking statements and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 certain matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management's plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, seeks, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, intends, might, goals, objectives, targets, planned, potential, projects, scheduled, will, assumes, guidance, outlook, in service date, or other similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding: expected levels of cash distributions by williams partners l.p. (wpz) with respect to general partner interests, incentive distribution rights, and limited partner interests; levels of dividends to stockholders; our future credit ratings; amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; financial condition and liquidity; business strategy; cash flow from operations or results of operations; seasonality of certain business components; natural gas, natural gas liquids and olefins supply, prices and demand; demand for our services. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: whether wpz will produce sufficient cash flows to provide the level of cash distributions we expect; whether we are able to pay current and expected levels of dividends; availability of supplies, market demand, and volatility of prices; 21 inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers); the strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition; whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate and execute investment opportunities; our ability to acquire new businesses and assets and successfully integrate those operations and assets into our existing businesses, as well as successfully expand our facilities; development of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and development hazards and unforeseen interruptions; the ability to recover expected insurance proceeds related to the geismar plant; costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations (including safety and environmental regulations), environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings; our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in maintenance and construction costs; changes in the current geopolitical situation; our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties; risks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements, future changes in our credit ratings, as well as the credit rating of wpz as determined by nationally-recognized credit rating agencies and the availability and cost of capital; the amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate; risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions; acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions; additional risks described in our filings with the sec. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. 22 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. prices for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain our existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities, and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of current low commodity prices or a further decline in commodity prices. price volatility can impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. price volatility can also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the markets for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, olefins, oil, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and quantity of foreign imports of natural gas and oil; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold. the long-term financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, and demand for those supplies in our traditional markets. our ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties in our supply basins. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. we do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas and ngl reserves connected to our systems and processing facilities. accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. in addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital could adversely affect the development and production of additional natural gas reserves, the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities and the import and export of natural gas supplies. the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of 23 natural gas supply for our customers. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation and processing facilities. demand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils or nuclear energy could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth. as part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. we have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. these are processes we use to identify, evaluate and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. we may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. if we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner. our growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines and facilities, ngl transportation, fractionation or storage facilities or olefins processing facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities. we also face all the risks associated with construction. these risks include the inability to obtain skilled labor, equipment, materials, permits, rights-of-way and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed on time and the risk that construction cost overruns could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that: changing circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact our investment analysis, including our projections of revenues, earnings and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes which are materially different than anticipated; we could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets. we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate; acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures; acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, either by the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access capital markets or obtain acceptable terms. if realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, and could also have an adverse impact on our financial position or cash flows. we do not own all of the interests in the partially owned entities, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and control these assets in a manner beneficial to us. because we do not control the partially owned entities, we may have limited flexibility to control the operation of or cash distributions received from these entities. the partially owned entities' organizational documents generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis; however, in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating the businesses. following the closing of the merger our investments in the partially owned entities accounted for approximately 8 percent of our total consolidated assets. conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our partially owned entities, on the other hand, with regard to our partially owned entities' governance, business and operations. if a conflict of interest arises 24 between us and a partially owned entity, other owners may control the partially owned entity's actions with respect to such matter (subject to certain limitations), which could be detrimental to our business. any future disagreements with the other co-owners of these assets could adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic or industry conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. holders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount identified in guidance or any dividends. we may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. the actual amount of cash we dividend may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the amount of cash that wpz and our other subsidiaries distribute to us; the amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow; the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements; the cost of acquisitions, if any. a failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage and a decrease in the value of our stock price. our cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of wpz. our partnership interest, including the general partner's holding of incentive distribution rights, in wpz is currently our largest cash-generating asset. therefore, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of wpz to make distributions to its partners. a significant decline in wpz's earnings and/or distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us. our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. some of our competitors are large oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater access to supplies of natural gas and ngls than we do. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. similarly, a highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. as a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. failure to successfully compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow. we rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and ngls. although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to us by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be adversely affected. our ability to replace, extend, or 25 add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative fuel sources, such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy; natural gas, ngl, and olefins prices, demand, availability and margins in our markets. higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. also, lower energy commodity prices could result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems; general economic, financial markets and industry conditions; the effects of regulation on us, our customers and our contracting practices; our ability to understand our customers' expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services and effectively manage customer relationships. the results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market. some of our businesses, including wpz's access midstream business, are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers. some of our businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for delivery of critical goods or services. for instance, pursuant to a compression services agreement, wpz's access midstream business receives a substantial portion of its compression capacity on certain gathering systems from exlp operating llc ( exterran operating ). exterran operating has, until december 31, 2020, the exclusive right to provide the access midstream business with compression services on certain gas gathering systems located in wyoming, texas, oklahoma, louisiana, kansas and arkansas, in return for the payment of specified monthly rates for the services provided, subject to an annual escalation provision. if a supplier on which one of our businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. if our business is unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks and such risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. we conduct certain operations through joint ventures that may limit our operational flexibility or require us to make additional capital contributions. some of our operations are conducted through joint venture arrangements, and we may enter additional joint ventures in the future. in a joint venture arrangement, we have less operational flexibility, as actions must be taken in accordance with the applicable governing provisions of the joint venture. in certain cases we: have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations; cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to these operations; are dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures; may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets; may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in the area of mutual interest. in addition, joint venture participants may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, 26 such as the obligation to pay substantial carried costs pertaining to the joint venture and to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. the performance and ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations under joint venture arrangements is outside our control. if these third parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, our business may be adversely affected. joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives, and disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. if we fail to make a required capital contribution under the applicable governing provisions of a joint venture arrangements, we could be deemed to be in default under the joint venture agreement. joint venture partners may be permitted to fund any deficiency resulting from our failure to make such capital contribution, which would result in a dilution of our ownership interest, or such joint venture partners may have the option to purchase all of our existing interest in the subject joint venture. the risks described above or the failure to continue joint ventures, or to resolve disagreements with joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operation that is the subject of a joint venture, which could in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions. there are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation and storage of ngls, the processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including: aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), ngls, olefins products, brine or industrial chemicals; collapse or failure of storage caverns; operator error; damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; pollution and other environmental risks; fires, explosions, craterings and blowouts; truck and rail loading and unloading; operating in a marine environment. any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage and substantial losses to us. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. an event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. we do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. we currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $695 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate with a $2 million per occurrence deductible. this insurance covers 27 us, our subsidiaries, and certain of our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. this excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and ngl operations. although we maintain property insurance on certain physical assets that we own, lease or are responsible to insure, the policy may not cover the full replacement cost of all damaged assets or the entire amount of business interruption loss we may experience. in addition, certain perils may be excluded from coverage or be sub-limited. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. we may elect to self-insure a portion of our risks. we do not insure our onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at certain locations such as river crossings and compressor stations. offshore assets are covered for property damage when loss is due to a named windstorm event, but coverage for loss caused by a named windstorm is significantly sub-limited and subject to a large deductible. all of our insurance is subject to deductibles. in addition, to the insurance coverage described above, we are a member of oil insurance limited ( oil ), an energy industry mutual insurance company, which provides coverage for damage to our property. as an insured member of oil, we share in the losses among other oil members even if our property is not damaged. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and our ability to repay our debt. the time required to return wpz's geismar plant to full expanded production following the explosion and fire at the facility on june 13, 2013, and the amount and timing of insurance recoveries related to such incident could be materially different than we anticipate and could cause our financial results and levels of dividends to be materially different than we project. our projections of financial results and expected levels of dividends are based on numerous assumptions and estimates, including, but not limited to, the time required to return wpz's geismar plant to full expanded production and the amount and timing of insurance recoveries related to the june 13, 2013, explosion and fire at our geismar plant. additionally, insurers continue to evaluate wpz's claims and have raised questions around key assumptions involving its business-interruption claim; as a result, the insurers have elected to make a partial payment pending further assessment of these issues. although we currently expect wpz to recover most of the limits under a $500 million insurance program related to the geismar incident, there can be no assurance that it will recover the full policy limits. total receipts from the insurers to date are $296 million. our financial results and levels of dividends could be materially different than we project if our assumptions and estimates related to the incident are materially different than actual outcomes. our assets and operations, as well as our customers' assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers' assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. a significant disruption in our or our customers' operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. given the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. a terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport or distribute natural gas, ngls or other commodities. acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction 28 or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 29 our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions. we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices and protocols, we face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants and assets. we could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, hacktivists, or private individuals. the age, operating systems or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. we could also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud or unethical conduct, could result in damage to our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability or the loss of contracts, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and results of operations. the natural gas sales, transportation and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. in addition to regulation by other federal, state and local regulatory authorities, under the natural gas act of 1938, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. federal regulation extends to such matters as: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms, types of services and conditions of service; certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas. regulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business. our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities and expenditures that could exceed expectations. our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. substantial costs, liabilities, delays and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation and storage of ngls, processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and 30 production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations and delays in granting permits. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. in addition, climate change regulations and the costs associated with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases ( ghgs ) have the potential to affect our business. regulatory actions by the environmental protection agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage our ghg compliance program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. climate change and ghg regulation could also reduce demand for our services. if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the operation of our businesses might also be adversely affected by changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. 31 certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. in addition, existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers or our business activities. if new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional levels of reporting, regulation or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process and treat could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected. certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis. revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited term. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations. our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive 32 pressures. in addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over u.s. fiscal and monetary policies. these concerns, as well as actions taken by the u.s. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and u.s. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manners described above. a downgrade of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business. a downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. in addition, our ability to access capital markets could be limited by a downgrade of our credit ratings. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. this analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. as of february 25, 2015 we have been assigned investment-grade credit ratings at two of the three ratings agencies (subject to negative outlook by one of such agencies) and sub-investment-grade at the third rating agency. our ability to obtain credit in the future could be affected by wpz's credit ratings. a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through, and our cash flows are substantially derived from distributions paid to us by, wpz. due to our relationship with wpz, our ability to obtain credit will be affected by wpz's credit ratings. for instance, in june 2014 one of the credit rating agencies reduced our credit rating because of our reliance on residual cash flow streams from wpz and our transition to a holding company structure. we have been assigned investment-grade credit ratings at two of the three ratings agencies and sub-investment-grade at the third rating agency. if wpz were to experience a deterioration in its credit standing or financial condition, our access to credit and our ratings could be adversely affected. any future downgrading of a wpz credit rating could also result in a downgrading of our credit rating. a downgrading of a wpz credit rating could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future upon favorable terms, if at all. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and our credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk. we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off doubtful accounts. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. restrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility. our total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of december 31, 2014, was $20,892 million. the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets in certain circumstances. in addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, 33 the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our and our material subsidiaries' ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. our debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. for example, they could: make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness; impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes; diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. in addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and liquidity. institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility or with our former employees might not be adequately preserved. we expect that a significant percentage of employees will become eligible for retirement over the next several years. in certain areas of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. as these employees reach retirement age or their services are no longer available to us, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. our hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used and may in the future use fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract 34 that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract's counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, williams partners l.p. as such, this subsidiary's operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz, a publicly traded limited partnership. this subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken contractual obligations with respect to wpz as the general partner and to the limited partners of wpz. activities determined to involve such obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. our control of the general partner of wpz may increase the possibility of claims of breach of such duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise between wpz, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner's affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material. our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects. we currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the united states. the economic, political and legal conditions and regulatory environment in the countries in which we have interests or in which we might pursue acquisition or investment opportunities present risks that are different from or greater than those in the united states. these risks include, among others, delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, including with respect to the prices we realize for the commodities we produce and sell. the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain nonrecourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments. operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. in certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to u.s. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. in addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. in such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. we may or may not put contracts in place designed to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. we have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations. failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the united states. services provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. our reliance on others as service providers could have a material adverse effect on on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the execution of the integration strategy following the merger may not be successful. the ultimate success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits from combining these formerly separate businesses. realizing the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the effective integration of assets, operations, functions and personnel while maintaining adequate focus on our core businesses. any expected cost savings, economies of scale, enhanced liquidity or other operational 35 efficiencies, as well as revenue enhancement opportunities, or other synergies, may not occur. our management team expects to face challenges inherent in integrating certain acmp operations into the west and northeast g&amp;p operating areas as well as integrating certain functions that support business such as environmental, health and safety, engineering and construction and business development. if management is unable to minimize the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management during the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized or may only be realized to a lesser extent than expected. in addition, the inability to successfully manage the integration could have an adverse effect on us. the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, as well as the disruption of each of our ongoing businesses or the creation of inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. any or all of those occurrences could adversely affect our businesses' ability to maintain relationships with service providers, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. integration may also result in additional and unforeseen expenses, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger and materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx energy, inc (wpx) stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying an irs private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities. in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities. the spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements that we did not assume in our agreements with wpx. the spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. a court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or 36 obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. under the separation and distribution agreement between us and wpx, from and after the spin-off, each of wpx and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which each owns and operates. although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to wpx, particularly if wpx were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations. increases in interest rates could adversely impact our share price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash dividends at our intended levels. interest rates may increase in the future. as a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. as with other yield-oriented securities, our share price will be impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield. the distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to pay cash dividends at our intended levels. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 80 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. any borrowings under the credit facilities and any issuances under wpz's commercial paper program could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. (see note 14 debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 . long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2014 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: (2) fixed rate $ 750 (*) $ 375 $ 785 $ 500 $ 32 $ 17,435 $ 19,877 $ 20,121 interest rate 5.2 % 5.3 % 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.1 % 5.4 % variable rate $ $ $ $ 1,010 $ $ $ 1,010 $ 1,010 interest rate (3) commercial paper: variable rate $ 798 $ $ $ $ $ $ 798 $ 798 interest rate (4) ____________ (*) presented as long-term debt at december 31, 2014 due to the merged partnership's intent and ability to refinance. 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2013 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: (2) fixed rate $ $ 750 $ 375 $ 785 $ 500 $ 8,943 $ 11,353 $ 11,971 interest rate 5.5 % 5.6 % 5.6 % 5.5 % 5.4 % 6.0 % commercial paper: variable rate $ 225 $ $ $ $ $ $ 225 $ 225 interest rate (4) __________________ (1) includes unamortized discount and premium.

(3) the weighted average interest rates for acmp's $640 million and our $370 million credit facility borrowings at december 31, 2014 were 2.42 percent and 1.67 percent, respectively. (4) the weighted average interest rate was 0.92 percent and 0.42 percent at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 80 commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of ngls, olefins, and natural gas, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and energy commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts, and limited proprietary trading activities. our management of the risks associated with these market fluctuations includes maintaining a conservative capital structure and significant liquidity, as well as using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors, including changes in energy commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, our derivative activity was not material. (see note 17 fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.) foreign currency risk our foreign operations, whose functional currency is the local currency, are located primarily in canada. net assets of our foreign operations were approximately $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. these investments have the potential to impact our financial position due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the respective functional currencies against the u.s. dollar would have changed total stockholders' equity by approximately $157 million at december 31, 2014 . 81risk factors 21 risk factors forward-looking statements and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the reports, filings and other public announcements of the williams companies, inc.

numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: satisfaction of the conditions to the completion of the proposed etc merger, including receipt of the approval of williams' stockholders; the timing and likelihood of completion of the proposed etc merger, including the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental and regulatory approvals for the proposed merger that could reduce anticipated benefits or cause the parties to abandon the proposed transaction; the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation from the proposed etc merger will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the risk that the businesses of williams and energy transfer will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the proposed etc merger making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred in connection with the proposed etc merger; the possibility that the proposed etc merger does not close, including due to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions; whether wpz will produce sufficient cash flows to provide the level of cash distributions we expect; whether williams is able to pay current and expected levels of dividends; availability of supplies, market demand and volatility of prices; inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on customers and suppliers); the strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition; whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate and execute investment opportunities; our ability to acquire new businesses and assets and successfully integrate those operations and assets into our existing businesses as well as successfully expand our facilities; development of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions; costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations (including safety and environmental regulations), environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings; williams' costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in maintenance and construction costs; 22 changes in the current

ratings as determined by nationally-recognized credit rating agencies and the availability and cost of capital; the amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate; risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions; acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions; additional risks described in our filings with the sec. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. the pendency of the proposed etc merger could adversely affect our business and operations. in connection with the proposed etc merger, some of our customers or vendors may delay or defer decisions, which could negatively impact our revenues, earnings, cash flows and expenses, regardless of whether the proposed etc merger is completed. similarly, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the proposed etc merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the proposed etc merger. if we fail to complete the proposed etc merger, it may be difficult and expensive to recruit and hire replacements for departed employees. the proposed etc merger, its effects and related matters may also distract our employees from day-to-day operations and require substantial commitments of time and resources. in addition, due to operating covenants in the merger agreement, we may be unable, during the pendency of the proposed etc merger, to pursue certain strategic transactions, undertake certain significant capital projects, undertake certain significant financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions that are not in the ordinary course of business. such risks relating to vendors, customers, employees and those risks arising from operating covenants in the merger agreement will also apply to varying degrees to our subsidiaries and affiliates and thereby have a corresponding impact on us. there can be no assurance when or even if the proposed etc merger will be completed. completion of the proposed etc merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived, including approval of the proposed etc merger by our stockholders, the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the proposed etc merger under antitrust laws, the absence of any law 23 or order prohibiting the closing of the proposed etc merger, the declaration by the sec of the effectiveness of the registration statement on form s-4 of which the proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and the authorization of the listing on the nyse of the etc common shares. there can be no assurance that we, etc, and energy transfer will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond their or our control will be satisfied or waived. completion of the proposed etc merger is also conditioned on the accuracy of representations and warranties made by the parties to the merger agreement (subject to customary materiality qualifiers and other customary exceptions) and the performance in all material respects by the parties of obligations imposed under the merger agreement.we and energy transfer can mutually agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement, even if our stockholders have already voted to approve the merger agreement. we and energy transfer can also terminate the merger agreement under other specified circumstances. if the proposed etc merger is not completed, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: because the current price of shares of our common stock may reflect a market premium based on the assumption that we will complete the proposed etc merger, a failure to complete the proposed etc merger could result in a decline in the price of shares of our common stock; in specified circumstances, we may be required to pay energy transfer a termination fee of $1.48 billion and certain of their expenses; we will not realize the benefits expected from being part of a larger combined organization; we have incurred and expect to continue incurring a number of non-recurring etc merger-related expenses that must be paid even if the proposed etc merger is not completed. in addition, if the proposed etc merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. we also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the proposed etc merger or to proceedings commenced against us to attempt to force us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement. the merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of us or could result in any competing proposal being at a lower price than it might otherwise be. the merger agreement contains provisions that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability to solicit, encourage, facilitate or discuss competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of us. in addition, energy transfer will have an opportunity to negotiate with us in response to any competing proposal that may be made before our board of directors is permitted to withdraw or qualify its recommendation. in some circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, we may be required to pay to energy transfer a termination fee of $1.48 billion. these provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the consideration proposed to be received or realized in the proposed etc merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances. the integration of our business following the proposed etc merger will involve considerable risks and may not be successful. achieving the anticipated benefits of the proposed etc merger will depend in part upon whether energy transfer can integrate our businesses in an effective and efficient manner. energy transfer may not be able to accomplish this integration process successfully. the integration of any business may be complex and time-consuming. the difficulties that could be encountered include the following: integrating personnel, operations and systems; coordinating the geographically dispersed organizations; 24 distraction of management and employees from operations changes in corporate culture; retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; maintaining business relationships; and inefficiencies associated with the integration of the operations of etc. in addition, there will be integration costs and non-recurring transaction costs associated with the proposed etc merger (such as fees paid to legal, financial, accounting and other advisors and other fees paid in connection with the proposed etc merger) and achieving the expected cost savings and synergies associated therewith, and such costs may be significant. an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the proposed etc merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process and the realization of such benefits, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of energy transfer, which may adversely affect the value of energy transfer common units and, in turn, the value of etc common shares after the completion of the merger. stockholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the proposed etc merger or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations. we have incurred and may continue to incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of the currently pending and any future stockholder litigation in connection with the proposed etc merger. such litigation may adversely affect our ability to complete the proposed etc merger and could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, including chesapeake energy corporation and its affiliates, and our credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk. we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies will not completely eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. the current low commodity price environment has, in particular, negatively impacted natural gas producers causing them significant economic stress including, in some cases, to file for bankruptcy protection or to renegotiate contracts.to the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with the customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the united states bankruptcy code, or may be renegotiated. further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial conditions. for example, chesapeake energy corporation and its affiliates, which accounted for approximately 18 percent of our 2015 consolidated revenues, have experienced significant, negative financial results due to sustained low commodity prices. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties or otherwise do not take or are unable to take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off accounts receivable. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. prices for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain our existing businesses. 25 our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities, and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of current low commodity prices or a further decline in commodity prices. price volatility has and could continue to impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. price volatility has and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the markets for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, olefins, oil, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and quantity of foreign imports of natural gas and oil; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold. downgrades of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, impact our liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business. our credit ratings have recently been downgraded. downgrades of our credit ratings increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. in addition, our ability to access capital markets could continue to be limited by the downgrading of our credit ratings. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. this analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. as of the date of the filing of this report, we have been assigned sub investment-grade credit ratings by each of the three ratings agencies. our ability to obtain credit in the future could be affected by wpz's credit ratings. a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through, and our cash flows are substantially derived from distributions paid to us by, wpz. due to our relationship with wpz, our ability to obtain credit will be affected by wpz's credit ratings. wpz's credit ratings have recently been downgraded. if wpz were to experience a further deterioration in its credit standing or financial condition, our access to capital and our ratings could be further adversely affected. any future downgrading of a wpz credit rating could also result in a further downgrading of our credit rating. a downgrading of a wpz credit rating could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future upon favorable terms, if at all. 26 the long-term financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, and demand for those supplies in our traditional markets. our ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties in our supply basins. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. we do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas and ngl reserves connected to our systems and processing facilities. accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. in addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital could adversely affect the development and production of additional natural gas reserves, the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities and the import and export of natural gas supplies. the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation and processing facilities. demand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils or nuclear energy could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth. as part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. we have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. these are processes we use to identify, evaluate and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. we may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. if we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner. our growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines and facilities, ngl transportation, fractionation or storage facilities or olefins processing facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities. we also face all the risks associated with construction. these risks include the inability to obtain skilled labor, equipment, materials, permits, rights-of-way and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed on time and the risk that construction cost overruns could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that: changing circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact our investment analysis, including our projections of revenues, earnings and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes which are materially different than anticipated; we could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets; we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate; acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures; 27 acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access capital markets or obtain acceptable terms. if realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, and could also have an adverse impact on our financial position or cash flows. we do not own all of the interests in the partially owned entities, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and control these assets in a manner beneficial to us. because we do not control the partially owned entities, we may have limited flexibility to control the operation of or cash distributions received from these entities. the partially owned entities' organizational documents generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis; however, in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating the businesses. as of december 31, 2015, our investments in the partially owned entities accounted for approximately 8 percent of our total consolidated assets. conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our partially owned entities, on the other hand, with regard to our partially owned entities' governance, business and operations. if a conflict of interest arises between us and a partially owned entity, other owners may control the partially owned entity's actions with respect to such matter (subject to certain limitations), which could be detrimental to our business. any future disagreements with the other co-owners of these assets could adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic or industry conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. holders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount expected or any dividends. we may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. the actual amount of cash we dividend may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the amount of cash that wpz and our other subsidiaries distribute to us; the amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow; the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements; the cost of acquisitions, if any. a failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage and a decrease in the value of our stock price. our cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of wpz. our partnership interest, including the general partner's holding of incentive distribution rights in wpz, is currently our largest cash-generating asset. therefore, we are, at the least, indirectly exposed to all the risks to which wpz is subject and our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of wpz to make distributions to its partners. a significant decline in wpz's earnings and/or distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us. we may not be able to sell assets or, if we are able to sell assets, to raise a sufficient amount of capital from such asset sales. in addition, the timing to enter into and close any asset sales could be significantly different than our expected timeline. in addition to the recent announcement that wpz plans to monetize assets during 2016 to fund capital and investment expenditures, it is possible that we could also engage in asset sales. given the commodity markets, financial markets and other challenges currently facing the energy sector, our competitors may also engage in asset sales leading to lower demand for the assets we wish to sell. we may not be able to sell the assets we identify for sale on favorable terms or at all. if we are able to sell assets, the timing of the receipt of the asset sale proceeds may not align with the timing of our capital requirements. a failure to raise sufficient capital from asset sales or a misalignment of the timing of capital raised and capital funding needs could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 28 an impairment of our assets, including goodwill, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce our earnings. gaap requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. if the current depressed energy commodity price environment persists for a prolonged period or further declines, such circumstances could result in additional impairments of our assets beyond those incurred in 2015 including impairments of our goodwill, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity method investments. additionally any asset monetization could result in impairments if any assets are sold for amounts less than their carrying value. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings. our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. some of our competitors are large oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater access to supplies of natural gas and ngls than we do. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. similarly, a highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. as a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. failure to successfully compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow. we rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and ngls. although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to us by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be adversely affected. our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative fuel sources, such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy; natural gas, ngl, and olefins prices, demand, availability and margins in our markets. higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. also, lower energy commodity prices could negatively impact our ability to maintain or achieve favorable contractual terms, including pricing, and could also result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems; general economic, financial markets and industry conditions; the effects of regulation on us, our customers and our contracting practices; our ability to understand our customers' expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services and effectively manage customer relationships. the results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market. 29 some of our businesses, including wpz's central business, are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers. some of our businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for delivery of critical goods or services. for instance, pursuant to a compression services agreement, wpz's central business receives a substantial portion of its compression capacity on certain gathering systems from exlp operating llc ( exterran operating ). exterran operating has, until december 31, 2020, the exclusive right to provide wpz's central business with compression services on certain gas gathering systems located in wyoming, texas, oklahoma, louisiana, and arkansas, in return for the payment of specified monthly rates for the services provided, subject to an annual escalation provision. if a supplier on which one of our businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. if our business is unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks and such risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. we will conduct certain operations through joint ventures that may limit our operational flexibility or require us to make additional capital contributions. some of our operations are conducted through joint venture arrangements, and we may enter additional joint ventures in the future. in a joint venture arrangement, we have less operational flexibility, as actions must be taken in accordance with the applicable governing provisions of the joint venture. in certain cases we: have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations; cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to these operations; are dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures; may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets; may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in the area of mutual interest. in addition, joint venture participants may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay substantial carried costs pertaining to the joint venture and to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. the performance and ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations under joint venture arrangements is outside our control. if these third parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, our business may be adversely affected. joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives, and disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. if we fail to make a required capital contribution under the applicable governing provisions of a joint venture arrangements, we could be deemed to be in default under the joint venture agreement. joint venture partners may be permitted to fund any deficiency resulting from our failure to make such capital contribution, which would result in a dilution of our ownership interest, or such joint venture partners may have the option to purchase all of our existing interest in the subject joint venture. the risks described above or the failure to continue joint ventures, or to resolve disagreements with joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operation that is the subject of a joint venture, which could in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions. there are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation and storage of ngls, the processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including: 30 aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), ngls, olefins products, brine or industrial chemicals; collapse or failure of storage caverns; operator error; damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; pollution and other environmental risks; fires, explosions, craterings and blowouts; truck and rail loading and unloading; operating in a marine environment. any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage and substantial losses to us. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. an event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. we do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. we currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $820 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate with a $2 million per occurrence deductible. this insurance covers us, our subsidiaries, and certain of our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. this excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and ngl operations. although we maintain property insurance on certain physical assets that we own, lease or are responsible to insure, the policy may not cover the full replacement cost of all damaged assets or the entire amount of business interruption loss we may experience. in addition, certain perils may be excluded from coverage or be sub-limited. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. we may elect to self-insure a portion of our risks. we do not insure our onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at certain locations such as river crossings and compressor stations. offshore assets are covered for property damage when loss is due to a named windstorm event, but coverage for loss caused by a named windstorm is significantly sub-limited and subject to a large deductible. all of our insurance is subject to deductibles. in addition, to the insurance coverage described above, we are a member of oil insurance limited ( oil ), an energy industry mutual insurance company, which provides coverage for damage to our property. as an insured member of oil, we share in the losses among other oil members even if our property is not damaged. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and our ability to repay our debt. our assets and operations, as well as our customers' assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. 31 our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers' assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. a significant disruption in our or our customers' operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. given the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. a terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport or distribute natural gas, ngls or other commodities. acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions. we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices and protocols, we face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants and assets. we could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, hacktivists, or private individuals. the age, operating systems or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. we could also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud or unethical conduct, could result in damage to our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability or the loss of contracts, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and results of operations. the natural gas sales, transportation and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. in addition to regulation by other federal, state and local regulatory authorities, under the natural gas act of 1938, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. federal regulation extends to such matters as: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms, types of services and conditions of service; certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; 32 relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas. regulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business. our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities and expenditures that could exceed expectations. our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. substantial costs, liabilities, delays and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation and storage of ngls, processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations and delays in granting permits. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. in addition, climate change regulations and the costs associated with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases ( ghgs ) have the potential to affect our business. regulatory actions by the environmental protection agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage our ghg compliance program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. climate change and ghg regulation could also reduce demand for our services. if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or 33 permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the operation of our businesses might also be adversely affected by changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. in addition, existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers or our business activities. if new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional levels of reporting, regulation or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process and treat could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected. certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis. revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations. 34 we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited term. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations. our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. in addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over u.s. fiscal and monetary policies. these concerns, as well as actions taken by the u.s. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and u.s. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manners described above. restrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility. our total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of december 31, 2015, was $23.99 billion. the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets in certain circumstances. in addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our and our material subsidiaries' ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. our debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. for example, they could: make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness; impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures,acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes; diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit 35 generally. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. in addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. for more information regarding our debt, please read note 14 debt, banking arrangements, and leases . institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility or with our former employees might not be adequately preserved. we expect that a significant percentage of employees will become eligible for retirement over the next several years. in certain areas of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. as these employees reach retirement age or their services are no longer available to us, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. our hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used and may in the future use fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract's counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, williams partners l.p. as such, this subsidiary's operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz, a publicly traded limited partnership. this subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken contractual obligations with respect to wpz as the general partner and to the limited partners of wpz. activities determined to involve such obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. our control of the general partner of wpz may increase the possibility of claims of breach of such duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise between wpz, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner's affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material. our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects. we currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the united states. the economic, political and legal conditions and regulatory environment in the countries in which we have interests or in which we might pursue acquisition or investment opportunities present risks that are different from or greater than those in the united states. these risks include, among others, delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, including with respect to the prices we realize for the commodities we produce and sell. the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments 36 could make it more difficult to obtain nonrecourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments. operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. in certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to u.s. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. in addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. in such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. we may or may not put contracts in place designed to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. we have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations. failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the united states. services provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. our reliance on others as service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the execution of the integration strategy following wpz's merger with access midstream partners, l.p. ( acmp ) in february 2015 (the acmp merger ) may not be successful. the ultimate success of the acmp merger will depend, in part, on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits from combining these formerly separate businesses. realizing the benefits of the acmp merger will depend in part on the effective integration of assets, operations, functions and personnel while maintaining adequate focus on our core businesses. any expected cost savings, economies of scale, enhanced liquidity or other operational efficiencies, as well as revenue enhancement opportunities, or other synergies, may not occur. if management is unable to minimize the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management during the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acmp merger may not be realized or may only be realized to a lesser extent than expected. in addition, the inability to successfully manage the integration could have an adverse effect on us. the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, as well as the disruption of each of our ongoing businesses or the creation of inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. any or all of those occurrences could adversely affect our businesses' ability to maintain relationships with service providers, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acmp merger. integration may also result in additional and unforeseen expenses, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the acmp merger and materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx energy, inc. (wpx) stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying an irs private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities. 37 in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities. the spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements that we did not assume in our agreements with wpx. the spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. a court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. under the separation and distribution agreement between us and wpx, from and after the spin-off, each of wpx and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which each owns and operates. although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to wpx, particularly if wpx were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations . increases in interest rates could adversely impact our share price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash dividends at our intended levels. interest rates may increase further in the future. as a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. as with other yield-oriented securities, our share price will be impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield. the distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to pay cash dividends at our intended levels. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 81 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. any borrowings under the credit facilities and any issuances under wpz's commercial paper program could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. (see note 14 debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 . long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium and debt issuance costs, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2015 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: (2) fixed rate $ 375 (*) $ 785 $ 500 $ 32 $ 2,121 $ 17,364 $ 21,177 $ 16,796 interest rate 5.1 % 5.1 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.5 % variable rate $ $ $ 850 $ $ 1,960 $ $ 2,810 $ 2,810 interest rate (3) commercial paper: variable rate $ 499 $ $ $ $ $ $ 499 $ 499 interest rate (4) _____________ (*) $200 million presented as long-term debt at december 31, 2015, due to wpz's intent and ability to refinance. 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2014 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: (2) fixed rate $ 750 (**) $ 375 $ 785 $ 500 $ 32 $ 17,327 $ 19,769 $ 20,121 interest rate 5.2 % 5.3 % 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.1 % 5.4 % variable rate $ $ $ $ 1,010 $ $ $ 1,010 $ 1,010 interest rate (5) commercial paper: variable rate $ 798 $ $ $ $ $ $ 798 $ 798 interest rate (4) _____________ (**) presented as long-term debt at december 31, 2014, due to wpz's intent and ability to refinance. __________________ (1) includes unamortized discount / premium and debt issuance costs.

(3) the weighted-average interest rates for wpz's $1.3 billion credit facility borrowing, wpz's $850 million term loan, and our $650 million credit facility borrowing at december 31, 2015 were 1.63 percent, 1.85 percent, and 2.32 percent, respectively. 81 (4) the weighted-average interest rate was 0.92 percent at both december 31, 2015 and 2014. (5) the weighted-average interest rates for wpz's $640 million and our $370 million credit facility borrowings at december 31, 2014 were 2.42 percent and 1.67 percent, respectively. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of ngls, olefins, and natural gas, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and energy commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts, and limited proprietary trading activities. our management of the risks associated with these market fluctuations includes maintaining a conservative capital structure and sufficient liquidity, as well as using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors, including changes in energy commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, our derivative activity was not material. (see note 17 fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.) foreign currency risk our foreign operations, whose functional currency is the local currency, are located in canada. net assets of our foreign operations were approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. these investments have the potential to impact our financial position due to fluctuations in the local currency arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the functional currency against the u.s. dollar would have changed total stockholders' equity by approximately $179 million and approximately $157 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 82risk factors 21 risk factors forward-looking statements and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the reports, filings and other public announcements of the williams companies, inc. (williams) may contain or incorporate by reference statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. such statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended (securities act), and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (exchange act). these forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management's plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, seeks, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, intends, might, goals, objectives, targets, planned, potential, projects, scheduled, will, assumes, guidance, outlook, in service date or other similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding: levels of cash distributions by williams partners l.p. (wpz) with respect to limited partner interests; levels of dividends to williams stockholders; future credit ratings of williams, wpz, and their affiliates; amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; financial condition and liquidity; business strategy; cash flow from operations or results of operations; seasonality of certain business components; natural gas, natural gas liquids, and olefins prices, supply, and demand; demand for our services. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: whether wpz will produce sufficient cash flows to provide the level of cash distributions that we expect; 21 whether we are able to pay current and expected levels of dividends; whether wpz elects to pay expected levels of cash distributions and we elect to pay expected levels of dividends; whether we will be able to effectively execute our financing plan including the receipt of anticipated levels of proceeds from planned asset sales; whether we will be able to effectively manage the transition in our board of directors and management as well as successfully execute our business restructuring; availability of supplies, including lower than anticipated volumes from third parties served by our midstream business, and market demand; volatility of pricing including the effect of lower than anticipated energy commodity prices and margins; inflation, interest rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on customers and suppliers); the strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition; whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate, and timely execute our capital projects and other investment opportunities in accordance with our forecasted capital expenditures budget; our ability to successfully expand our facilities and operations; development of alternative energy sources; availability of adequate insurance coverage and the impact of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions; the impact of existing and future laws, regulations, the regulatory environment, environmental liabilities, and litigation, as well as our ability to obtain permits and achieve favorable rate proceeding outcomes; our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in maintenance and construction costs; changes in the current geopolitical situation; our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties; risks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from debt agreements, future changes in credit ratings as determined by nationally-recognized credit rating agencies and the availability and cost of capital; the amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate; 22 risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities; acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions; additional risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec). given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and, in some cases our reputation. the occurrence of any of such risks could also adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. litigation pertaining to the etc merger, including litigation related to energy transfer equity, l.p.'s (ete's) termination of and failure to close the etc merger, may negatively impact our business and operations. we have incurred and may continue to incur additional costs in connection with the prosecution, defense or settlement of the currently pending and any future litigation relating to the etc merger or ete's termination of and failure to close the etc merger. such litigation includes, among other litigation matters, litigation brought by stockholders of us and unitholders of wpz related to the etc merger and/or williams' termination of the merger agreement with wpz. such litigation also includes the on-going litigation against ete and its affiliates a portion of which is on appeal in the delaware supreme court and in which ete has asserted counterclaims against us. we continue to believe that our lawsuit against ete and its affiliates is an enforcement of our rights under the merger agreement and that this lawsuit is designed to deliver to our stockholders benefits under the merger agreement. we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. such litigation may also create a distraction for our management team and board of directors and require time and attention. in addition, any litigation relating to the etc merger or ete's termination of and failure to close the etc merger could, among other things, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, including chesapeake energy corporation and its affiliates, and our credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk. we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies cannot completely eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers, and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, 23 deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. in a low commodity price environment certain of our customers could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress including, in some cases, to file for bankruptcy protection or to renegotiate contracts. to the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with the customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the united states bankruptcy code, or may be renegotiated. further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial conditions. for example, chesapeake energy corporation and its affiliates, which accounted for approximately 14 percent of our 2016 consolidated revenues, have experienced significant, negative financial results due to sustained low commodity prices. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties or otherwise do not take or are unable to take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off accounts receivable. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. prices for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil, and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to maintain our existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth, and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities, and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of current low commodity prices or a further decline in commodity prices. price volatility has and could continue to impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. price volatility has and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. the markets for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil, and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, olefins, oil, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and quantity of foreign imports of natural gas and oil; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; 24 the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold. downgrades of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, impact our liquidity, access to capital, and our costs of doing business. downgrades of our credit ratings increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. in addition, our ability to access capital markets could continue to be limited by the downgrading of our credit ratings. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. this analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market, and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. as of the date of the filing of this report, we have been assigned below investment-grade credit ratings by each of the three credit ratings agencies. our ability to obtain credit in the future could be affected by wpz's credit ratings. a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through, and our cash flows are substantially derived from distributions paid to us by, wpz. due to our relationship with wpz, our ability to obtain credit will be affected by wpz's credit ratings. if wpz were to experience a deterioration in its credit standing or financial condition, our access to capital, and our ratings could be adversely affected. any future downgrading of a wpz credit rating could also result in a downgrading of our credit rating. a downgrading of a wpz credit rating could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future upon favorable terms, if at all. the financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve. our ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties in our supply basins. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. we do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems and processing facilities. accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. in addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital could adversely affect the development and production of additional natural gas reserves, the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities and the import and export of natural gas supplies. localized low natural gas prices in one or more of our existing supply basins, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas made available to us. the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation, and processing facilities. demand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 25 we may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth. as part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. we have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. these are processes we use to identify, evaluate, and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. we may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. if we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner. our growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines, and facilities, ngl transportation, or fractionation or storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities. we also face all the risks associated with construction, including political opposition by landowners, environmental activists, and others resulting in the delay and/or denial of required governmental permits. other construction risks include the inability to obtain rights-of-way, skilled labor, equipment, materials, and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed, on time or at all, and the risk that construction cost overruns could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that: changing circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact our investment analysis, including our projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes which are materially different than anticipated; we could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets; we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate; acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial, and operational resources from existing operations and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, and procedures; acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access capital markets or obtain acceptable terms. if realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, or cash flows. we do not own all of the interests in the partially owned entities, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and control these assets in a manner beneficial to us. because we do not control the partially owned entities, we may have limited flexibility to control the operation of or cash distributions received from these entities. the partially owned entities' organizational documents generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis; however, in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating the businesses. as of december 31, 2016, our investments in the partially owned entities accounted for approximately 8 percent of our total consolidated assets. conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our partially owned entities, on the other hand, with regard to our partially owned entities' governance, business, or operations. if a conflict of interest arises between us and a partially owned entity, other owners may control the partially owned entity's actions with respect to such matter (subject to certain limitations), which could be detrimental to our business. any future disagreements with the other co-owners of these assets could adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic or industry conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 26 holders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount expected or any dividends. we may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. the actual amount of cash we dividend may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the amount of cash that wpz and our other subsidiaries distribute to us; the amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow; the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements; the cost of acquisitions, if any. a failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage, and a decrease in the value of our stock price. our cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of wpz. our partnership interest in wpz is currently our largest cash-generating asset. therefore, we are, at the least, indirectly exposed to all the risks to which wpz is subject and our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of wpz to make distributions to its partners. a significant decline in wpz's earnings and/or distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us. we may not be able to sell assets or, if we are able to sell assets, to raise a sufficient amount of capital from such asset sales. in addition, the timing to enter into and close any asset sales could be significantly different than our expected timeline. we are planning to monetize certain assets held by our subsidiaries in 2017 (including without limitation the geismar olefins facility owned by wpz) to fund additional debt reduction and capital and investment expenditures. given the commodity markets, financial markets, and other challenges currently facing the energy sector, our competitors may also engage in asset sales leading to lower demand for the assets we wish to sell. we may not be able to sell the assets we identify for sale on favorable terms or at all. if we are able to sell assets, the timing of the receipt of the asset sale proceeds may not align with the timing of our capital requirements. a failure to raise sufficient capital from asset sales or a misalignment of the timing of capital raised and capital funding needs could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. an impairment of our assets, including goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce our earnings. gaap requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. the outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity method investments. additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if any assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings. our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. some of our competitors are large oil, natural gas, and petrochemical companies that have greater access to supplies 27 of natural gas and ngls than we do. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion, or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. similarly, a highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. as a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. failure to successfully compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow. we rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and ngls. although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to us by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be adversely affected. our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative fuel sources, such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy; natural gas, ngl, and olefins prices, demand, availability, and margins in our markets. higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. also, lower energy commodity prices could negatively impact our ability to maintain or achieve favorable contractual terms, including pricing, and could also result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems; general economic, financial markets, and industry conditions; the effects of regulation on us, our customers, and our contracting practices; our ability to understand our customers' expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services and effectively manage customer relationships. the results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market. some of our businesses are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers. some of our businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for delivery of critical goods or services. for instance, pursuant to a compression services agreement, one of our businesses receives a substantial portion of its compression capacity on certain gathering systems from exlp operating llc ( exterran operating ). exterran operating has, until december 31, 2020, the exclusive right to provide compression services on certain gas gathering systems located in wyoming, texas, oklahoma, louisiana, and arkansas, in return for the payment of specified monthly rates for the services provided, subject to an annual escalation provision. if a supplier on which one of our businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services, such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. if our business is unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks and such risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. 28 we will conduct certain operations through joint ventures that may limit our operational flexibility or require us to make additional capital contributions. some of our operations are conducted through joint venture arrangements, and we may enter additional joint ventures in the future. in a joint venture arrangement, we have less operational flexibility, as actions must be taken in accordance with the applicable governing provisions of the joint venture. in certain cases: we cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to these operations; we are dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures; we may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets; we may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in the area of mutual interest; we have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations. in addition, joint venture participants may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay substantial carried costs pertaining to the joint venture and to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. the performance and ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations under joint venture arrangements is outside our control. if these third parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, our business may be adversely affected. joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives, and disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. if we fail to make a required capital contribution under the applicable governing provisions of a joint venture arrangements, we could be deemed to be in default under the joint venture agreement. joint venture partners may be permitted to fund any deficiency resulting from our failure to make such capital contribution, which would result in a dilution of our ownership interest, or such joint venture partners may have the option to purchase all of our existing interest in the subject joint venture. the risks described above or the failure to continue joint ventures, or to resolve disagreements with joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations that are the subject of any joint venture, which could in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions. there are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, the processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including: aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), ngls, olefins products, brine, or industrial chemicals; collapse or failure of storage caverns; 29 operator error; damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; pollution and other environmental risks; fires, explosions, craterings, and blowouts; truck and rail loading and unloading; operating in a marine environment. any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage, and substantial losses to us. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. an event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. we do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. we currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $820 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate with a $2 million per occurrence deductible. this insurance covers us, our subsidiaries, and certain of our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. this excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and ngl operations. although we maintain property insurance on certain physical assets that we own, lease or are responsible to insure, the policy may not cover the full replacement cost of all damaged assets or the entire amount of business interruption loss we may experience. in addition, certain perils may be excluded from coverage or be sub-limited. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. we may elect to self-insure a portion of our risks. we do not insure our onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at certain locations such as river crossings and compressor stations. offshore assets are covered for property damage when loss is due to a named windstorm event, but coverage for loss caused by a named windstorm is subject to a significant sub-limit and to a large deductible. all of our insurance is subject to deductibles. in addition, to the insurance coverage described above, we are a member of oil insurance limited (oil), an energy industry mutual insurance company, which provides coverage for damage to our property. as an insured member of oil, we share in the losses among other oil members even if our property is not damaged. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to repay our debt. our assets and operations, as well as our customers' assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers' assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires, and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the 30 historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. a significant disruption in our or our customers' operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. given the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store, and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. a terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets, or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport, or distribute natural gas, ngls, or other commodities. acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions. we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices, and protocols, we face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants, and assets. we could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, hacktivists , or private individuals. the age, operating systems, or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. we could also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud, or unethical conduct, could result in damage to our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability, or the loss of contracts, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. the natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. in addition to regulation by other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, under the natural gas act of 1938, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. federal regulation extends to such matters as: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms, types of services, and conditions of service; certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition, or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities; accounts and records; 31 depreciation and amortization policies; relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases, or transportation of natural gas. regulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs, and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business. our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations. our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. substantial costs, liabilities, delays, and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, and delays or denials in granting permits. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil, and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. in addition, climate change regulations and the costs associated with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs) have the potential to affect our business. regulatory actions by the environmental protection agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities, or (iii) administer and manage our ghg compliance program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. climate change and ghg regulation could also reduce demand for our services. 32 if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated, or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. the operation of our businesses might also be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. in addition, existing regulations, including those pertaining to financial assurances to be provided by our businesses in respect of potential asset decommissioning and abandonment activities, might be revised, reinterpreted, or otherwise enforced in a manner which differs from prior regulatory action. new laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might also be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers, or our business activities. if new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional or revised levels of reporting, regulation, or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process, and treat could decline, our compliance costs could increase, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally 33 subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis. revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited terms. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations. our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. in addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over u.s. fiscal and monetary policies. these concerns, as well as actions taken by the u.s. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and u.s. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manner described above. restrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility. our total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of december 31, 2016, was $23.41 billion. the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets in certain circumstances. in addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our and our material subsidiaries' ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants, and other limitations with which we will need to comply. our debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. for example, they could: make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness; 34 impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes, or other purposes; diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes, or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend, or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations, or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. in addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read note 14 debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements. the company's business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism. in recent years, stockholder activism, including threatened or actual proxy contests, has been directed against numerous public companies, including the company. during the latter part of fiscal year 2016, the company was the target of a proxy contest from a stockholder activist, which resulted in significant costs to the company. if stockholder activists were to again take or threaten to take actions against the company, the company could incur significant costs as well as the distraction of management, which could have an adverse effect on the company's financial results. stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of the company. such proposals may disrupt the company's business and divert the attention of the company's management and employees; and any perceived uncertainties as to the company's future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, the perception that the company needs a change in the direction of its business, or the perception that the company is unstable or lacks continuity, any or all of which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and may make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, which could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. we are experiencing significant change in the composition of our board of directors and senior management. on june 30, 2016, frank t. macinnis stepped down as chairman of the board and kathleen b. cooper was appointed as chairman of the board. also on june 30, 2016, each of ralph izzo, frank t. macinnis, eric w. mandelblatt, keith a. meister, steven w. nance, and laura a. sugg resigned from the board. on august 28, 2016, the board appointed three new independent directors to the board: stephen w. bergstrom, scott d. sheffield, and william h. spence; on september 23, 2016, the board appointed two additional new independent directors to the board: stephen i. chazen and peter a. ragauss; and on december 5, 2016, the board appointed two more additional new independent 35 directors to the board: charles casey cogut and michael a. creel. three of williams former directors, joseph r. cleveland, john a. hagg, and juanita h. hinshaw, determined not to stand for re-election at the company's november 23, 2016 annual meeting. thus, the board is now composed of eleven directors, seven of whom were appointed in the second half of 2016. on december 13, 2016, the company announced the retirement of senior vice president robert s. purgason, effective january 31, 2017. the company is also executing on a restructuring process, shifting from five operating areas to three, and on february 14, 2017 the company announced the appointment of micheal dunn as executive vice president and chief operating officer. the changes in composition of the company's board and management impose an additional demand for attention, time and energy of board members and management in connection with orientation and education of new members about the company, including with regard to its business strategies and objectives, assets and operations, and policies and practices, which could distract the board and management from execution of the company's strategy and objectives. additionally, such changes invite new analysis of our business as the new members contribute to the formulation of our business strategies and objectives, which could implicate changes to such strategy and objectives. it is possible that changes to the composition of our board and management could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility or with our former employees might not be adequately preserved. we expect that a significant percentage of employees will become eligible for retirement over the next several years. in addition, as part of an internal restructuring, we recently announced the reduction of five operating areas into three and the closing of our oklahoma city office and the consolidation of employee positions to tulsa or other locations. as employees with significant institutional knowledge reach retirement age, choose not to relocate with us, or their services are otherwise no longer available to us, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting, and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. our hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into, contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used, and may in the future use, fixed-price, forward, physical purchase, and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract's counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, williams partners l.p. as such, this subsidiary's operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz, a publicly traded limited partnership. this subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken contractual obligations with respect to wpz as the general partner and to the limited partners of wpz. activities, determined to involve such obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. our control of the general partner of wpz may increase the possibility of claims of breach of such duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts 36 of interest that may arise between wpz, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner's affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material. failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the united states. services provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. our reliance on others as service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other postretirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates, and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx energy, inc. (wpx) stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying a u.s. internal revenue service (irs) private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities. in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (code), except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain, or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities. the spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements that we did not assume in our agreements with wpx. the spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. a court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor 37 insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. under the separation and distribution agreement between us and wpx, from and after the spin-off, each of wpx and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities, and other obligations related to the business or businesses which each owns and operates. although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to wpx, particularly if wpx were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations . increases in interest rates could adversely impact our share price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash dividends at our intended levels. interest rates may increase further in the future. as a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. as with other yield-oriented securities, our share price will be impacted by the level of our dividends and implied dividend yield. the distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to pay cash dividends at our intended levels. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 76 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. any borrowings under the credit facilities and any issuances under wpz's commercial paper program could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. (see note 14 debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 . long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium and debt issuance costs, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2016 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: fixed rate $ 785 $ 500 $ 32 $ 2,121 $ 871 $ 17,475 $ 21,784 $ 22,465 interest rate 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.6 % variable rate $ $ 850 $ $ 775 $ $ $ 1,625 $ 1,625 interest rate (3) commercial paper: variable rate $ 93 $ $ $ $ $ $ 93 $ 93 interest rate (4) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2015 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: (2) fixed rate $ 375 (*) $ 785 $ 500 $ 32 $ 2,121 $ 17,364 $ 21,177 $ 16,796 interest rate 5.1 % 5.1 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.5 % variable rate $ $ $ 850 $ $ 1,960 $ $ 2,810 $ 2,810 interest rate (5) commercial paper: variable rate $ 499 $ $ $ $ $ $ 499 $ 499 interest rate (4) _____________ (*) $200 million presented as long-term debt at december 31, 2015, due to wpz's intent and ability to refinance. __________________ (1) includes unamortized discount / premium and debt issuance costs. (2) excludes capital leases. (3) the weighted-average interest rates for wpz's $850 million term loan, and our $775 million credit facility borrowing at december 31, 2016 were 2.50 percent and 2.51 percent, respectively. (4) the weighted-average interest rate was 1.06 percent and 0.92 percent at december 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. 76 (5) the weighted-average interest rates for wpz's $1.3 billion credit facility borrowing, wpz's $850 million term loan, and our $650 million credit facility borrowing at december 31, 2015 were 1.63 percent, 1.85 percent, and 2.32 percent, respectively. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of ngls, olefins, and natural gas, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and energy commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts, and limited proprietary trading activities. our management of the risks associated with these market fluctuations includes maintaining sufficient liquidity, as well as using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors, including changes in energy commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2016 and 2015 , our derivative activity was not material. (see note 17 fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.) foreign currency risk in september 2016, we disposed of our canadian operations, which comprised substantially all of our foreign operations.

statements regarding: expected levels of cash distributions by wpz with respect to limited partner interests; levels of dividends to williams stockholders; future credit ratings of williams, wpz, and their affiliates; amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; expected in-service dates for capital projects; financial condition and liquidity; business strategy; cash flow from operations or results of operations; seasonality of certain business components; natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, supply, and demand; demand for our services. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties, and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 20 whether wpz will produce sufficient cash flows to provide expected levels of cash distributions; whether we are able to pay current and expected levels of dividends; whether wpz elects to pay expected levels of cash distributions and we elect to pay expected levels of dividends; whether we will be able to effectively execute our financing plan; availability of supplies, including lower than anticipated volumes from third parties served by our midstream business, and market demand; volatility of pricing including the effect of lower than anticipated energy commodity prices and margins; inflation, interest rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers); the strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition; whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate, and timely execute our capital projects and other investment opportunities in accordance with our forecasted capital expenditures budget; our ability to successfully expand our facilities and operations; development and rate of adoption of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions, and the availability of adequate insurance coverage; the impact of existing and future laws (including, but not limited to, the tax cuts and job acts of 2017), regulations, the regulatory environment, environmental liabilities, and litigation, as well as our ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals and achieve favorable rate proceeding outcomes; our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in maintenance and construction costs; changes in the current geopolitical situation; our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties; risks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from debt agreements, future changes in credit ratings as determined by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, and the availability and cost of capital; the amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate; risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities; 21 acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions; additional risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec). given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and, in some cases our reputation. the occurrence of any of such risks could also adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. risks related to our business the financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve. our ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties in our supply basins. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. we do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems and processing facilities. accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. in addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital could adversely affect the development and production of additional natural gas reserves, the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities and the import and export of natural gas supplies. localized low natural gas prices in one or more of our existing supply basins, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas made available to us. the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation, and processing facilities. demand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy, as well as technological advances and renewable sources of energy, could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 22 prices for natural gas, ngls, oil, and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to maintain our existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth, and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of natural gas, ngls, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of current low commodity prices, or a further decline in commodity prices. price volatility has and could continue to impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. price volatility has and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. the markets for natural gas, ngls, oil, and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, oil, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and quantity of foreign imports of natural gas and oil; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, including chesapeake energy corporation and its affiliates, and our credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk. we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy, or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies cannot completely eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers, and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. in a low commodity price environment certain of our customers could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress including, in some cases, to file for bankruptcy protection or to renegotiate contracts. to the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with the customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the united states bankruptcy code, or may be renegotiated. further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. for example, chesapeake 23 energy corporation and its affiliates, which accounted for approximately 10 percent of our 2017 consolidated revenues, have experienced significant, negative financial results due to sustained low commodity prices. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties or otherwise do not take or are unable to take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness, and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off accounts receivable. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. we may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth. as part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. we have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. these are processes we use to identify, evaluate, and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. we may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. if we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner. our growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines, and facilities, ngl transportation, or fractionation or storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities. in the current environment, we may face political opposition by landowners, environmental activists, and others resulting in the delay and/or denial of required governmental permits. additional risks associated with construction may include the inability to obtain rights-of-way, skilled labor, equipment, materials, and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed, on time or at all, and the risk that construction cost overruns could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that: changing circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact our investment analysis, including our projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes which are materially different than anticipated; we could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets; we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate; acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, and procedures; acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access capital markets or obtain acceptable terms. if realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, or cash flows. we may face opposition to the construction and operation of our pipelines and facilities from various groups. we may face opposition to the construction and operation of our pipelines and facilities from environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates. such opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving 24 our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the operation of our assets and business. in addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. any such event that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. holders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount expected or any dividends. we may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. the actual amount of cash we dividend may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the amount of cash that wpz and our other subsidiaries distribute to us; the amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow; the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements; the cost of acquisitions, if any. a failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage, and a decrease in the value of our stock price. our cash flow is heavily dependent on the earnings and distributions of wpz. our partnership interest in wpz is our largest cash-generating asset. therefore, we are indirectly exposed to all of the risks to which wpz is subject, as our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of wpz to make distributions to its partners. a significant decline in wpz's earnings and/or distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, williams partners l.p. as such, this subsidiary's operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz, a publicly traded limited partnership. this subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken contractual obligations with respect to wpz as the general partner and to the limited partners of wpz. activities, determined to involve such obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. our control of the general partner of wpz may increase the possibility of claims of breach of such duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise between wpz, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner's affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material. our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. any current or future competitor that delivers natural gas, ngls, or other commodities into the areas that we operate could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price, location, facilities or other factors. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion, or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. failure to successfully 25 compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. we do not own all of the interests in the partially owned entities, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and control these assets in a manner beneficial to us. because we do not control the partially owned entities, we may have limited flexibility to control the operation of or cash distributions received from these entities. the partially owned entities' organizational documents generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis; however, in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating the businesses. as of december 31, 2017, our investments in the partially owned entities accounted for approximately 7 percent of our total consolidated assets. conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our partially owned entities, on the other hand, with regard to our partially owned entities' governance, business, or operations. if a conflict of interest arises between us and a partially owned entity, other owners may control the partially owned entity's actions with respect to such matter (subject to certain limitations), which could be detrimental to our business. any future disagreements with the other co-owners of these assets could adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic or industry conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. we will conduct certain operations through joint ventures that may limit our operational flexibility or require us to make additional capital contributions. some of our operations are conducted through joint venture arrangements, and we may enter additional joint ventures in the future. in a joint venture arrangement, we have less operational flexibility, as actions must be taken in accordance with the applicable governing provisions of the joint venture. in certain cases: we cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to these operations; we are dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures; we may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets; we may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in the area of mutual interest; we have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations. in addition, joint venture participants may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay substantial carried costs pertaining to the joint venture and to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture, the performance of which is outside our control. similarly, if we fail to make a required capital contribution under the applicable governing provisions of a joint venture arrangement, we could be deemed to be in default under the joint venture agreement. joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives, and disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. the risks described above or the failure to continue joint ventures, or to resolve disagreements with joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations that are the subject of any joint venture, which could in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 26 we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow. we rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and ngls. although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to us by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be adversely affected. our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative sources, such as electricity, renewable resources, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy; natural gas and ngl prices, demand, availability, and margins in our markets. higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. also, lower energy commodity prices could negatively impact our ability to maintain or achieve favorable contractual terms, including pricing, and could also result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems; general economic, financial markets, and industry conditions; the effects of regulation on us, our customers, and our contracting practices; our ability to understand our customers' expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services and effectively manage customer relationships. the results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market. certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. some of our businesses are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers. some of our businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for delivery of critical goods or services. if a supplier on which one of our businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services, such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. if our business is unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks and such risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. 27 failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the united states. services provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. our reliance on others as service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. an impairment of our assets, including goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce our earnings. gaap requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. the outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity method investments. additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if any assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings. our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions. there are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including: aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), ngls, crude oil, or other products; collapse or failure of storage caverns; operator error; damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; pollution and other environmental risks; fires, explosions, craterings, and blowouts; security risks, including cybersecurity; operating in a marine environment. any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage, and substantial losses to us. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. an event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. 28 we do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to repay our debt. our assets and operations, as well as our customers' assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers' assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires, and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. a significant disruption in our or our customers' operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our business could be negatively impacted by acts of terrorism and security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions. given the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store, and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. a terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets, or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport, or distribute natural gas, ngls, or other commodities. acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices, and protocols, we face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants, and assets. we could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, hacktivists , or private individuals. the age, operating systems, or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. we could also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud, or unethical conduct, could result in damage to our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability, or the loss of contracts, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver 29 natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated, or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis. revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited terms. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism. in recent years, stockholder activism, including threatened or actual proxy contests, has been directed against numerous public companies, including ours. during the latter part of fiscal year 2016, we were the target of a proxy contest from a stockholder activist, which resulted in our incurring significant costs. if stockholder activists were to again take or threaten to take actions against the company or seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction or operations of the company, we could incur significant costs as well as the distraction of management, which could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results. in addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. litigation pertaining to the etc merger, including litigation related to energy transfer equity, l.p.'s (ete's) termination of and failure to close the etc merger, may negatively impact our business and operations. we have incurred and may continue to incur additional costs in connection with the prosecution, defense or settlement of the currently pending and any future litigation relating to the etc merger or ete's termination of and failure to close the etc merger. we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. such litigation may also create a distraction for our management team and board of directors and require time and attention. in addition, any litigation relating to the etc merger or ete's termination of and failure to close the etc merger could, among other things, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other postretirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates, and changes in pension laws. 30 changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact our results of operations. events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract labor may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including with the workforce needs associated with projects and ongoing operations. failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate the businesses. if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, results of operations could be negatively impacted. if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx energy, inc. (wpx) stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying a u.s. internal revenue service (irs) private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities. in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (code), except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain, or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities. the wpx spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements that we did not assume in our agreements with wpx. the spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. a court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. under the separation and distribution agreement between us and wpx, from and after the spin-off, each of wpx and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities, and other obligations related to the business or businesses which each owns and operates. although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to wpx, particularly if wpx were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations. 31 risks related to financing our business downgrades of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, impact our liquidity, access to capital, and our costs of doing business. downgrades of our credit ratings increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. in addition, our ability to access capital markets could continue to be limited by the downgrading of our credit ratings. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. this analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market, and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. as of the date of the filing of this report, we have been assigned below investment-grade credit ratings by each of the three credit ratings agencies. our ability to obtain credit in the future could be affected by wpz's credit ratings. a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through, and our cash flows are substantially derived from, distributions paid to us by wpz. due to our relationship with wpz, our ability to obtain credit will be affected by wpz's credit ratings. if wpz were to experience a deterioration in its credit standing or financial condition, our access to capital, and our ratings could be adversely affected. any future downgrading of a wpz credit rating could also result in a downgrading of our credit rating. a downgrading of a wpz credit rating could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future upon favorable terms, if at all. difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations. our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. in addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over u.s. fiscal and monetary policies. these concerns, as well as actions taken by the u.s. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and u.s. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manner described above. restrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility. our total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of december 31, 2017, was $20.9 billion. the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets in certain circumstances. in addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our, and our material subsidiaries', ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants, and other limitations with which we will need to comply. our debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. for example, they could: 32 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness; impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes, or other purposes; diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes, or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend, or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations, or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. in addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read note 13 debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements. increases in interest rates could adversely impact our share price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash dividends at our intended levels. interest rates may increase in the future. as a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. as with other yield-oriented securities, our share price will be impacted by the level of our dividends and implied dividend yield. the dividend yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to pay cash dividends at our intended levels. our hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used, and may in the future use, fixed-price, forward, physical purchase, and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract's counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. 33 risks related to regulations the natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. in addition to regulation by other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, under the natural gas act of 1938, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. federal regulation extends to such matters as: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms, types of services, and conditions of service; certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition, or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases, or transportation of natural gas. regulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs, and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business. the operation of our businesses might also be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. 34 in addition, existing regulations, including those pertaining to financial assurances to be provided by our businesses in respect of potential asset decommissioning and abandonment activities, might be revised, reinterpreted, or otherwise enforced in a manner which differs from prior regulatory action. new laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might also be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers, or our business activities. if new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional or revised levels of reporting, regulation, or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process, and treat could decline, our compliance costs could increase, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations. our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the security of industrial facilities. substantial costs, liabilities, delays, and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, and delays or denials in granting permits. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil, and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. in addition, climate change regulations and the costs associated with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs) have the potential to affect our business. regulatory actions by the environmental protection agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, or administer and manage our ghg compliance program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. climate change and ghg regulation could also reduce demand for our services. we expect that certain aspects of tax cuts and jobs act signed into law on december 22, 2017 (tax reform), including regulatory liabilities relating to reduced corporate federal income tax rates, could adversely impact our financial condition and our future financial results. 35 certain of the rates we charge to our customers are subject to the rate-making policies of the ferc. these policies permit us to include in our cost-of-service an income tax allowance that includes a deferred income tax component. the recently enacted tax reform makes significant changes to the u.s. federal income tax rules applicable to both individuals and entities, including among other things, a reduction in corporate federal income tax rates. although we expect the decreased federal income tax rates will require us to return amounts to certain customers for this item through future rates and have recognized a regulatory liability, the details of any regulatory implementation guidance remain uncertain. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 75 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. any borrowings under the credit facilities and any issuances under wpz's commercial paper program could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. (see note 13 debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 . the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2017 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: fixed rate $ 502 $ 33 $ 2,123 $ 873 $ 2,003 $ 15,131 $ 20,665 $ 22,735 weighted-average interest rate 5.1 % 5.1 % 5.1 % 5.1 % 5.2 % 5.7 % variable rate (2) $ $ $ $ 270 $ $ $ 270 $ 270 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2016 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: fixed rate $ 785 $ 500 $ 32 $ 2,121 $ 871 $ 17,475 $ 21,784 $ 22,465 weighted-average interest rate 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.6 % variable rate (3) $ $ 850 $ $ 775 $ $ $ 1,625 $ 1,625 commercial paper: variable rate (4) $ 93 $ $ $ $ $ $ 93 $ 93 __________________ (1) includes unamortized discount / premium and debt issuance costs. (2) the weighted-average interest rate for our $270 million credit facility borrowing at december 31, 2017 was 3.16 percent. (3) the weighted-average interest rates for wpz's $850 million term loan and our $775 million credit facility borrowing at december 31, 2016 were 2.50 percent and 2.51 percent, respectively. (4) the weighted-average interest rate was 1.06 percent at december 31, 2016 . commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of ngls and natural gas, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and energy commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts, and limited proprietary trading activities. our management of the risks associated with these market fluctuations includes maintaining sufficient liquidity, as well as using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject 75 to many factors, including changes in energy commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2017 and 2016 , our derivative activity was not material. (see note 16 fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.) 76risk factors 19 risk factors the operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers, and the natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. environmental matters our operations are subject to federal environmental laws and regulations as well as the state, local, and tribal laws and regulations adopted by the jurisdictions in which we operate. we could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as liability for cleanup costs. materials could be released into the environment in several ways including, but not limited to: leakage from gathering systems, underground gas storage caverns, pipelines, processing or treating facilities, transportation facilities, and storage tanks; damage to facilities resulting from accidents during normal operations; damages to onshore and offshore equipment and facilities resulting from storm events or natural disasters; blowouts, cratering, and explosions. in addition, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by former owners or operators of our properties. we believe compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or current competitive position. however, environmental laws and regulations could affect our business in various ways from time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance expenditures, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek relief from the ferc for rate increases to recover the costs of certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses. for additional information regarding the potential impact of federal, state, tribal, or local regulatory measures on our business and specific environmental issues, please refer to part 1, item 1a. risk factors our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and

contingent liabilities and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements. 17 competition gas pipeline business the market for supplying natural gas is highly competitive and new pipelines, storage facilities, and other related services are expanding to service the growing demand for natural gas. additionally, pipeline capacity in many growing natural gas supply basins is constrained causing competition to increase among pipeline companies as they strive to connect those basins to major natural gas demand centers. in our business, we compete with major intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines. in the last few years, local distribution companies have also started entering into the long-haul transportation business through joint venture pipelines. the principle elements of competition in the interstate natural gas pipeline business are based on rates, reliability, quality of customer service, diversity of supply, and proximity to customers and market hubs. significant entrance barriers to build new pipelines exist, including federal and growing state regulations and public opposition against new pipeline builds, and these factors will continue to impact potential competition for the foreseeable future. however, we believe the position of our existing infrastructure, established strategic long-term contracts, and the fact that our pipelines have numerous receipt and delivery points along our systems provide us a competitive advantage, especially along the eastern seaboard and northwestern united states. midstream business competition for natural gas gathering, processing, treating, transporting, and storing natural gas continues to increase as production from shales and other resource areas continues to grow. our midstream services compete with similar facilities that are in the same proximity as our assets. we face competition from major and independent natural gas midstream providers, private equity firms, and major integrated oil and natural gas companies that gather, transport, process, fractionate, store, and market natural gas and ngls, as well as some larger exploration and production companies that are choosing to develop midstream services to handle their own natural gas. our gathering and processing agreements are generally long-term agreements that may include acreage dedication. we primarily face competition to the extent these agreements approach renewal and new volume opportunities arise. competition for natural gas volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms (products retained or fees charged), array of services provided, efficiency and reliability of services, location of gathering facilities, available capacity, downstream interconnects, and latent capacity. we believe our significant presence in traditional prolific supply basins, our solid positions in growing shale plays, our reputation as a reliable operator, and our ability to offer integrated packages of services position us well against our competition. for additional information regarding competition for our services or otherwise affecting our business, please refer to part 1, item 1a. risk factors - the financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve, our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results , and we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow. employees at february 1, 2019 , we had 5,322 full-time employees. 18 item 1a. risk factors forward-looking statements and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the reports, filings, and other public announcements of williams may contain or incorporate by reference statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. such statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended (securities act) and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management's plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions, and other matters as discussed below. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events, or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, seeks, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, intends, might, goals, objectives, targets, planned, potential, projects, scheduled, will, assumes, guidance, outlook, in-service date, or other similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding: levels of dividends to williams stockholders; future credit ratings of williams and its affiliates; amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; expected in-service dates for capital projects; financial condition and liquidity; business strategy; cash flow from operations or results of operations; seasonality of certain business components; natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, supply, and demand; demand for our services. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: whether we are able to pay current and expected levels of dividends; 19 whether we will be able to effectively execute our financing plan; availability of supplies, market demand, and volatility of prices; inflation, interest rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on customers and suppliers); the strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition; whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate and timely execute our capital projects and investment opportunities; our ability to acquire new businesses and assets and successfully integrate those operations and assets into existing businesses as well as successfully expand our facilities, and to consummate asset sales on acceptable terms; development and rate of adoption of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions; the impact of existing and future laws and regulations (including but not limited to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017), the regulatory environment, environmental liabilities, and litigation, as well as our ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals, and achieve favorable rate proceeding outcomes; our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in maintenance and construction costs, as well as our ability to obtain sufficient construction related inputs including skilled labor; changes in the current geopolitical situation; our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties; risks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from debt agreements, future changes in credit ratings as determined by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, and the availability and cost of capital; the amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate; risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities; acts of terrorism, cybersecurity incidents, and related disruptions; additional risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. 20 in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and, in some cases our reputation. the occurrence of any of such risks could also adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. risks related to our business the financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve. our ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties in our supply basins. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. we do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems and processing facilities. accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. in addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital could adversely affect the development and production of additional natural gas reserves, the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities and the import and export of natural gas supplies. localized low natural gas prices in one or more of our existing supply basins, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas made available to us. the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation, and processing facilities. demand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy, as well as technological advances and renewable sources of energy, could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. prices for natural gas, ngls, oil, and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to maintain our existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth, and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of natural gas, ngls, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of low commodity prices, or a decline in commodity prices. price volatility has and could continue to impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available 21 for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. price volatility has and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. the markets for natural gas, ngls, oil, and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, oil, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and quantity of foreign imports and domestic exports of natural gas and oil; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and our credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk. we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy, or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies cannot completely eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers, and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. in a low commodity price environment certain of our customers could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress including, in some cases, to file for bankruptcy protection or to renegotiate contracts. to the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with the customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the united states bankruptcy code, or may be renegotiated. further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties or otherwise do not take or are unable to take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness, and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off accounts receivable. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 22 we face opposition to operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from various individuals and groups. we have experienced, and we anticipate that we will continue to face, opposition to the operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from governmental officials, environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates. in some instances, we encounter opposition which disfavors hydrocarbon-based energy supplies regardless of practical implementation or financial considerations. opposition to our operation and expansion can take many forms, including the delay or denial of required governmental permits, organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the operation or expansion of our assets and business. in addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. any such event that delays or prevents the expansion of our business, that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth. as part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. we have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. these are processes we use to identify, evaluate, and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. we may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates or assets may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate or assets, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. if we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner. our growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines, and facilities, ngl transportation, or fractionation or storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities. additional risks associated with construction may include the inability to obtain rights-of-way, skilled labor, equipment, materials, and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed, on time or at all, and the risk that construction cost overruns could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that: changing circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact our investment analysis, including our projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes which are materially different than anticipated; we could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets; we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate; acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, and procedures; acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access capital markets or obtain acceptable terms. if realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, or cash flows. 23 holders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount expected or any dividends. we may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. the actual amount of cash we dividend may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the amount of cash that our subsidiaries distribute to us; the amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow; the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements; the cost of acquisitions, if any. a failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage, and a decrease in the value of our stock price. our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. any current or future competitor that delivers natural gas, ngls, or other commodities into the areas that we operate could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price, location, facilities or other factors. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion, or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. failure to successfully compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. we do not own 100 percent of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries, including the partially owned entities, which may limit our ability to operate and control these subsidiaries. certain operations, including the partially owned entities, are conducted through arrangements that may limit our ability to operate and control these operations. the operations of our current non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the partially owned entities, are conducted in accordance with their organizational documents. we anticipate that we will enter into more such arrangements, including through new joint venture structures or new partially owned entities. we may have limited operational flexibility in such current and future arrangements and we may not be able to control the timing or amount of cash distributions received. in certain cases: we cannot control the amount of cash reserves determined to be necessary to operate the business, which reduces cash available for distributions; we cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund and we are dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures; we may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets; we may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in the area of mutual interest; 24 we have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations; we may have additional obligations, such as required capital contributions, that are important to the success of the operations. in addition, conflicts of interest may arise between us, on the one hand, and other interest owners, on the other hand. if such conflicts of interest arise, we may not have the ability to control the outcome with respect to the matter in question. disputes between us and other interest owners may also result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. the risks described above or the failure to continue such arrangements could adversely affect our ability to conduct the operations that are the subject of such arrangements which could, in turn, negatively affect our business, growth strategy, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow. we rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and ngls. although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to us by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be adversely affected. our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative sources, such as electricity, renewable resources, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy; natural gas and ngl prices, demand, availability, and margins in our markets. higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. also, lower energy commodity prices could negatively impact our ability to maintain or achieve favorable contractual terms, including pricing, and could also result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems; general economic, financial markets, and industry conditions; the effects of regulation on us, our customers, and our contracting practices; our ability to understand our customers' expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services and effectively manage customer relationships. the results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market. certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. 25 some of our businesses are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers. some of our businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for delivery of critical goods or services. if a supplier on which one of our businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services, such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. if our business is unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks and such risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the united states. services provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. our reliance on others as service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. an impairment of our assets, including property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce our earnings. gaap requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. the outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments. additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if any assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings. our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions. there are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including: aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), ngls, crude oil, or other products; collapse or failure of storage caverns; operator error; damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; pollution and other environmental risks; fires, explosions, craterings, and blowouts; security risks, including cybersecurity; 26 operating in a marine environment. any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage, and substantial losses to us. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. an event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. we do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to repay our debt. our assets and operations, as well as our customers' assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers' assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires, and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. a significant disruption in our or our customers' operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our business could be negatively impacted by acts of terrorism and related disruptions. given the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store, and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. a terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets, or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport, or distribute natural gas, ngls, or other commodities. acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. a breach of our information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on us or third parties with whom we are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of our assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and harm our reputation. we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. our board of directors has oversight responsibility with regard to assessment of the major risks inherent in our business, including cybersecurity risks, and reviews management's efforts to address and mitigate such risks, including the establishment and implementation of policies to address cybersecurity threats. we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant time, manpower and capital in our information technology infrastructure. however, the age, operating systems, or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices, and protocols, we regularly face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems that are used to operate our pipelines, plants, and assets. we face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated 27 attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, hacktivists , or private individuals. we face the threat of theft and misuse of sensitive data and information, including customer and employee information. we also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. we also are subject to cybersecurity risks arising from the fact that our business operations are interconnected with third parties, including third-party pipelines, other facilities and our contractors and vendors. in addition, the breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud, or unethical conduct, could result in damage to or destruction of our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability, the loss of contracts, the imposition of significant costs associated with remediation and litigation, heightened regulatory scrutiny, increased insurance costs, and a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated, or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis. revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited terms. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism. in recent years, stockholder activism, including threatened or actual proxy contests, has been directed against numerous public companies, including ours. during the latter part of fiscal year 2016, we were the target of a proxy contest from a stockholder activist, which resulted in our incurring significant costs. if stockholder activists were to again take or threaten to take actions against the company or seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction or operations of the company, we could incur significant costs as well as the distraction of management, 28 which could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results. in addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other postretirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates, and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact our results of operations. events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract labor may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including with the workforce needs associated with projects and ongoing operations. failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate the businesses. if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, results of operations could be negatively impacted. if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx energy, inc. (wpx) stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying a u.s. internal revenue service private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities. in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (code), except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain, or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities. risks related to financing our business downgrades of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, impact our liquidity, access to capital, and our costs of doing business. downgrades of our credit ratings increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. in addition, our ability to access capital markets could continue to be limited by the downgrading of our credit ratings. 29 credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. this analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market, and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. as of the date of the filing of this report, we have been assigned an investment-grade credit rating by each of the three credit ratings agencies. difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations. our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. in addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over u.s. fiscal and monetary policies. these concerns, as well as actions taken by the u.s. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and u.s. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manner described above. restrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility. our total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of december 31, 2018, was $22.4 billion. the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets in certain circumstances. in addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our, and our material subsidiaries', ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants, and other limitations with which we will need to comply. our debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. for example, they could: make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness; impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes, or other purposes; diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes, or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. 30 our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend, or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations, or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. in addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read note 14 debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements. increases in interest rates could adversely impact our share price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash dividends at our intended levels. interest rates may increase in the future. as a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. as with other yield-oriented securities, our share price will be impacted by the level of our dividends and implied dividend yield. the dividend yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to pay cash dividends at our intended levels. our hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used, and may in the future use, fixed-price, forward, physical purchase, and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract's counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. risks related to regulations the natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. in addition to regulation by other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. federal regulation extends to such matters as: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms, types of services, and conditions of service; certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition, or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities; 31 accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases, or transportation of natural gas. regulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs, and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business. the operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. in addition, existing regulations, including those pertaining to financial assurances to be provided by our businesses in respect of potential asset decommissioning and abandonment activities, might be revised, reinterpreted, or otherwise enforced in a manner which differs from prior regulatory action. new laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might also be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers, or our business activities. if new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional or revised levels of reporting, regulation, or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process, and treat could decline, our compliance costs could increase, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations. our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the security of industrial facilities. substantial costs, liabilities, delays, and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of 32 stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, and delays or denials in granting permits. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil, and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. in addition, climate change regulations and the costs associated with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs) have the potential to affect our business. regulatory actions by the environmental protection agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, or administer and manage our ghg compliance program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. climate change and ghg regulation could also reduce demand for our services. we expect that certain aspects of the tax cuts and jobs act signed into law on december 22, 2017 (tax reform), including regulatory liabilities relating to reduced corporate federal income tax rates, could adversely impact our financial condition and our future financial results. tax reform made significant changes to the u.s. federal income tax rules applicable to both individuals and entities, including among other things, a reduction in corporate federal income tax rates. the rates we charge to our customers are subject to the rate-making policies of the ferc. these policies permit us to include in our cost-of-service an income tax allowance that includes a deferred income tax component. although we expect the decreased federal income tax rates will require us to return amounts to certain customers through future rates and have recognized a regulatory liability, the details of any regulatory implementation guidance remain uncertain. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 72 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. any borrowings under our credit facility and any issuances under our commercial paper program could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. (see note 14 debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 . see note 17 fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements for the methods used in determining the fair value of our long-term debt. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2018 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: fixed rate $ 47 $ 2,138 $ 890 $ 2,021 $ 1,473 $ 15,685 $ 22,254 $ 23,170 weighted-average interest rate 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.3 % 5.5 % 5.7 % variable rate (2) $ $ $ $ $ 160 $ $ 160 $ 160 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2017 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: fixed rate $ 502 $ 33 $ 2,123 $ 873 $ 2,003 $ 15,131 $ 20,665 $ 22,735 weighted-average interest rate 5.1 % 5.1 % 5.1 % 5.1 % 5.2 % 5.7 % variable rate (3) $ $ $ $ 270 $ $ $ 270 $ 270 __________________ (1) includes unamortized discount / premium and debt issuance costs. (2) the weighted-average interest rate for our $160 million credit facility borrowing at december 31, 2018 was 3.77 percent. (3) the weighted-average interest rate for our $270 million credit facility borrowing at december 31, 2017 was 3.16 percent. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of ngls and natural gas, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and energy commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts, and limited proprietary trading activities. our management of the risks associated with these market fluctuations includes maintaining sufficient liquidity, as well as using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors, including changes in energy commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2018 and 2017 , our derivative activity was not material. (see note 17 fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.) 72risk factors 21 risk factors the operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their 18 interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers, and the natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. environmental matters our operations are subject to federal environmental laws and regulations as well as the state, local, and tribal laws and regulations adopted by the jurisdictions in which we operate. we could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as liability for cleanup costs. materials could be released into the environment in several ways including, but not limited to: leakage from gathering systems, underground gas storage caverns, pipelines, processing or treating facilities, transportation facilities, and storage tanks; damage to facilities resulting from accidents during normal operations; damages to onshore and offshore equipment and facilities resulting from storm events or natural disasters; blowouts, cratering, and explosions. in addition, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by former owners or operators of our properties. we believe compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or current competitive position. however, environmental laws and regulations could affect our business in various ways from time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance expenditures, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek relief from the ferc for rate increases to recover the costs of certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses. for additional information regarding the potential impact of federal, state, tribal, or local regulatory measures on our business and specific environmental issues, please refer to part 1, item 1a. risk factors our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations, and part ii, item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental and environmental matters in part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 19 contingent liabilities and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements. competition gas pipeline business the market for supplying natural gas is highly competitive and new pipelines, storage facilities, and other related services are expanding to service the growing demand for natural gas. additionally, pipeline capacity in many growing natural gas supply basins is constrained causing competition to increase among pipeline companies as they strive to connect those basins to major natural gas demand centers. in our business, we predominately compete with major intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines. in the last few years, local distribution companies have also started entering into the long-haul transportation business through joint venture pipelines. the principle elements of competition in the interstate natural gas pipeline business are based on rates, reliability, quality of customer service, diversity of supply, and proximity to customers and market hubs. significant entrance barriers to build new pipelines exist, including federal and growing state regulations and public opposition against new pipeline builds, and these factors will continue to impact potential competition for the foreseeable future. however, we believe our past success in working with regulators and the public, the position of our existing infrastructure, established strategic long-term contracts, and the fact that our pipelines have numerous receipt and 19 delivery points along our systems provide us a competitive advantage, especially along the eastern seaboard and northwestern united states. midstream business competition for natural gas gathering, processing, treating, transporting, and storing natural gas continues to increase as production from shales and other resource areas continues to grow. our midstream services compete with similar facilities that are in the same proximity as our assets. we face competition from companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including major and independent natural gas midstream providers, private equity firms, and major integrated oil and natural gas companies that gather, transport, process, fractionate, store, and market natural gas and ngls, as well as some larger exploration and production companies that are choosing to develop midstream services to handle their own natural gas. our gathering and processing agreements are generally long-term agreements that may include acreage dedication. competition for natural gas volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms (products retained or fees charged), array of services provided, efficiency and reliability of services, location of gathering facilities, available capacity, downstream interconnects, and latent capacity. we believe our significant presence in traditional prolific supply basins, our solid positions in growing shale plays, our expertise and reputation as a reliable operator, and our ability to offer integrated packages of services position us well against our competition. for additional information regarding competition for our services or otherwise affecting our business, please refer to part 1, item 1a. risk factors - the financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve, our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results , and we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow. employees at february 1, 2020 , we had 4,812 full-time employees. website access to reports and other information we

act of 1995 the reports, filings, and other public announcements of williams may contain or incorporate by reference statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. such statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended (securities act) and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management's plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions, and other matters as discussed below. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events, or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, seeks, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, intends, might, goals, objectives, targets, planned, potential, projects, scheduled, will, assumes, guidance, outlook, in-service date, or other similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding: levels of dividends to williams stockholders; future credit ratings of williams and its affiliates; amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; expected in-service dates for capital projects; financial condition and liquidity; business strategy; cash flow from operations or results of operations; seasonality of certain business components; natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, supply, and demand; demand for our services. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties, and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: availability of supplies, market demand, and volatility of prices; 21 development and rate of adoption of alternative energy sources; the impact of existing and future laws and regulations, the regulatory environment, environmental liabilities, and litigation, as well as our ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals, and achieve favorable rate proceeding outcomes; our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties; our ability to acquire new businesses and assets and successfully integrate those operations and assets into existing businesses as well as successfully expand our facilities, and to consummate asset sales on acceptable terms; whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate, and timely execute our capital projects and investment opportunities; the strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition; the amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate; whether we will be able to effectively execute our financing plan; increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices; the physical and financial risks associated with climate change; the impact of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions; risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities; acts of terrorism, cybersecurity incidents, and related disruptions; our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in maintenance and construction costs, as well as our ability to obtain sufficient construction related inputs including skilled labor; inflation, interest rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on customers and suppliers); risks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from debt agreements, future changes in credit ratings as determined by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, and the availability and cost of capital; changes in the current geopolitical situation; whether we are able to pay current and expected levels of dividends; additional risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission. 22 given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and, in some cases our reputation. the occurrence of any of such risks could also adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. risks related to our business the financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve. our ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties in our supply basins. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. we do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems and processing facilities. accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. in addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital have, and may continue to, adversely affect the development and production of existing or additional natural gas reserves and the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities. the import and export of natural gas supplies may also be affected by such conditions. low natural gas prices in one or more of our existing supply basins, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas made available to us. the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation, and processing facilities. demand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy, as well as technological advances and renewable sources of energy, could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 23 prices for natural gas, ngls, oil, and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to maintain our existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth, and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of natural gas, ngls, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of low commodity prices, or a decline in commodity prices. price volatility has and could continue to impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. price volatility has and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. the markets for natural gas, ngls, oil, and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, oil, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and quantity of foreign imports and domestic exports of natural gas and oil; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and our credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk. we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy, are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns or are dependent upon us, in some cases without a readily available alternative, to provide necessary services. however, our credit procedures and policies cannot completely eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers, and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. in a low commodity price environment certain of our customers have been or could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress resulting, in some cases, in a customer bankruptcy filing or an effort to renegotiate our contracts. to the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with the customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the united states bankruptcy code or, if we so agree, may be renegotiated. further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results 24 of operations, and cash flows. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties or otherwise do not take or are unable to take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness, and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off accounts receivable. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. we face opposition to operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from various individuals and groups. we have experienced, and we anticipate that we will continue to face, opposition to the operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from governmental officials, environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates. in some instances, we encounter opposition which disfavors hydrocarbon-based energy supplies regardless of practical implementation or financial considerations. opposition to our operation and expansion can take many forms, including the delay or denial of required governmental permits, organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the operation or expansion of our assets and business. in addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. any such event that delays or prevents the expansion of our business, that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth. as part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. we have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. these are processes we use to identify, evaluate, and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. we may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates or assets may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate or assets, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. if we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner. our growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines, and facilities, ngl transportation, or fractionation or storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities. additional risks associated with construction may include the inability to obtain rights-of-way, skilled labor, equipment, materials, and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed, on time or at all, and the risk that construction cost overruns could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that: changing circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact our investment analysis, including our projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes which are materially different than anticipated; we could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets; we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate; acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, and procedures; 25 acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access capital markets or obtain acceptable terms. if realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, or cash flows. our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. any current or future competitor that delivers natural gas, ngls, or other commodities into the areas that we operate could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price, location, facilities or other factors. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion, or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. failure to successfully compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. we do not own 100 percent of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries, including the partially owned entities, which may limit our ability to operate and control these subsidiaries. certain operations, including the partially owned entities, are conducted through arrangements that may limit our ability to operate and control these operations. the operations of our current non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the partially owned entities, are conducted in accordance with their organizational documents. we anticipate that we will enter into more such arrangements, including through new joint venture structures or new partially owned entities. we may have limited operational flexibility in such current and future arrangements and we may not be able to control the timing or amount of cash distributions received. in certain cases: we cannot control the amount of cash reserves determined to be necessary to operate the business, which reduces cash available for distributions; we cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund and we are dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures; we may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets; we may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in the area of mutual interest; we have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations; we may have additional obligations, such as required capital contributions, that are important to the success of the operations. in addition, conflicts of interest may arise between us, on the one hand, and other interest owners, on the other hand. if such conflicts of interest arise, we may not have the ability to control the outcome with respect to the matter in question. disputes between us and other interest owners may also result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. 26 the risks described above or the failure to continue such arrangements could adversely affect our ability to conduct the operations that are the subject of such arrangements which could, in turn, negatively affect our business, growth strategy, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow. we rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and ngls. although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to us by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be adversely affected. our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative sources, such as electricity, renewable resources, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy; natural gas and ngl prices, demand, availability, and margins in our markets. higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. also, lower energy commodity prices could negatively impact our ability to maintain or achieve favorable contractual terms, including pricing, and could also result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems; general economic, financial markets, and industry conditions; the effects of regulation on us, our customers, and our contracting practices; our ability to understand our customers' expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services and effectively manage customer relationships. the results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market. certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. some of our businesses are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers. some of our businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for delivery of critical goods or services. if a supplier on which one of our businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services, such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. if our business is unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks and such 27 risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the united states. services provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. our reliance on others as service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. an impairment of our assets, including property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce our earnings. gaap requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. the outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments. additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if any assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings. increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance ( esg ) practices. investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on esg practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. regardless of the industry, investors' increased focus and activism related to esg and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company's esg practices. companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for esg issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected. we face pressures from our stockholders, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. our stockholders may require us to implement esg procedures or standards in order to remain invested in us or before they may make further investments in us. additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event our esg procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies. we have adopted certain practices as highlighted in our 2018 sustainability report, including with respect to air emissions, biodiversity and land use, climate change and environmental stewardship. it is possible, however, that our stockholders might not be satisfied with our sustainability efforts or the speed of their adoption. if we do not meet our stockholders' expectations, our business, ability to access capital, and/or our stock price could be harmed. additionally, adverse effects upon the oil and gas industry related to the worldwide social and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from climate change, changes in political leadership and environmental policies, changes in geopolitical-social views toward fossil fuels and renewable energy, concern about the environmental impact of climate change and investors' expectations regarding esg matters, may also adversely affect demand for our services. any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry could have a significant financial and operational adverse impact on our business. 28 the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the price of our stock and our business and financial condition. we may be subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. the threat of global climate change may create physical and financial risks to our business. energy needs vary with weather conditions. to the extent weather conditions may be affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in more pipelines and other infrastructure to serve increased demand. a decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. weather conditions outside of our operating territory could also have an impact on our revenues. to the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. we may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to mitigating these physical risks. additionally, many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events, which may lead to higher insurance costs, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather. these climate-related changes could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone and rain-susceptible regions. to the extent financial markets view climate change and greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. climate change and ghg regulation could also reduce demand for our services. our business could also be affected by the potential for lawsuits against ghg emitters, based on links drawn between ghg emissions and climate change. our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions. there are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including: aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), ngls, crude oil, or other products; collapse or failure of storage caverns; operator error; damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; pollution and other environmental risks; fires, explosions, craterings, and blowouts; security risks, including cybersecurity; operating in a marine environment. 29 any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage, and substantial losses to us. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. an event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. we do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to repay our debt. our assets and operations, as well as our customers' assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers' assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires, and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. a significant disruption in our or our customers' operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our business could be negatively impacted by acts of terrorism and related disruptions. given the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store, and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. a terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets, or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport, or distribute natural gas, ngls, or other commodities. acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. a breach of our information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on us or third parties with whom we are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of our assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and harm our reputation. we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. our board of directors has oversight responsibility with regard to assessment of the major risks inherent in our business, including cybersecurity risks, and reviews management's efforts to address and mitigate such risks, including the establishment and implementation of policies to address cybersecurity threats. we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant time, manpower and capital in our information technology infrastructure. however, the age, operating systems, or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices, and protocols, we regularly face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems that are used to operate our pipelines, plants, and assets. we face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, hacktivists , or private individuals. we face the threat of theft and misuse of sensitive data and information, including customer and employee information. we also face attempts to 30 gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. we also are subject to cybersecurity risks arising from the fact that our business operations are interconnected with third parties, including third-party pipelines, other facilities and our contractors and vendors. in addition, the breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud, or unethical conduct, could result in damage to or destruction of our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability, the loss of contracts, the imposition of significant costs associated with remediation and litigation, heightened regulatory scrutiny, increased insurance costs, and a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated, or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis. revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited terms. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism. in recent years, stockholder activism, including threatened or actual proxy contests, has been directed against numerous public companies, including ours. we were the target of a proxy contest from a stockholder activist, which resulted in our incurring significant costs. if stockholder activists were to again take or threaten to take actions against the company or seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction or operations of the company, we could incur significant costs as well as the distraction of management, which could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results. in addition, actions 31 of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates, and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact our results of operations. events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, the challenges of attracting new, qualified workers to the midstream energy industry, or unavailability of contract labor may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including with the workforce needs associated with projects and ongoing operations. failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate the businesses. if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, results of operations could be negatively impacted. holders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount expected or any dividends. we may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. the actual amount of cash we dividend may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the amount of cash that our subsidiaries distribute to us; the amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow; the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements; the cost of acquisitions, if any. a failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage, and a decrease in the value of our stock price. if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx energy, inc. (wpx) stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying a u.s. internal revenue service private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities. in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (code), except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect 32 that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain, or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities. risks related to financing our business downgrades of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, impact our liquidity, access to capital, and our costs of doing business. downgrades of our credit ratings increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. in addition, our ability to access capital markets could continue to be limited by the downgrading of our credit ratings. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. this analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market, and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. as of the date of the filing of this report, we have been assigned an investment-grade credit rating by each of the three credit ratings agencies. difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations. our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. in addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over u.s. fiscal and monetary policies. these concerns, as well as actions taken by the u.s. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and u.s. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manner described above. restrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility. our total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of december 31, 2019, was $22.3 billion. the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets in certain circumstances. in addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our, and our material subsidiaries', ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants, and other limitations with which we will need to comply. 33 our debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. for example, they could: make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness; impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes, or other purposes; diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes, or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend, or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations, or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. in addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read note 15 debt and banking arrangements of notes to consolidated financial statements. changes to interest rates or increases in interest rates could adversely impact our access to credit, share price, our ability to issue securities or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash dividends at our intended levels. interest rates may increase in the future. as a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. as with other yield-oriented securities, our share price will be impacted by the level of our dividends and implied dividend yield. the dividend yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to pay cash dividends at our intended levels. our hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used, and may in the future use, fixed-price, forward, physical purchase, and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract's counterparty 34 credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. risks related to regulations the operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. in addition, existing regulations, including those pertaining to financial assurances to be provided by our businesses in respect of potential asset decommissioning and abandonment activities, might be revised, reinterpreted, or otherwise enforced in a manner which differs from prior regulatory action. new laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might also be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers, or our business activities. if new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional or revised levels of reporting, regulation, or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process, and treat could decline, our compliance costs could increase, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. the natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. in addition to regulation by other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. federal regulation extends to such matters as: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms, types of services, and conditions of service; certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition, or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; 35 relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases, or transportation of natural gas. regulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs, and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business. our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations. our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the security of industrial facilities. substantial costs, liabilities, delays, and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, and delays or denials in granting permits. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil, and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. in addition, climate change regulations and the costs associated with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases have the potential to affect our business. regulatory actions by the environmental protection agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, or administer and manage our ghg compliance program. we believe it is possible that future governmental legislation and/or regulation may require us either to limit ghg emissions associated with our operations or to purchase allowances for such emissions. however, we cannot predict precisely what form these future regulations might take, the stringency of any such regulations or when they might become effective. several legislative bills have been introduced in the united states congress that would require carbon dioxide emission reductions. previously considered proposals have included, among other things, limitations on the amount of ghgs that can be emitted (so called caps ) together with systems of permitted emissions allowances. these proposals could require us to reduce emissions or to purchase allowances for such emissions. 36 in addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives could also lead to the regulation of ghg emissions sooner than and/or independent of federal regulation. these regulations could be more stringent than any federal legislation that may be adopted. future legislation and/or regulation designed to reduce ghg emissions could make some of our activities uneconomic to maintain or operate. we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments in this area and otherwise take efforts to limit and reduce ghg emissions from our facilities. although the regulation of ghg emissions may have a material impact on our operations and rates, we believe it is premature to attempt to quantify the potential costs of the impacts. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 71 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. any borrowings under our credit facility and any issuances under our commercial paper program could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. (see note 15 debt and banking arrangements of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 . see note 18 fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements for the methods used in determining the fair value of our long-term debt. 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2019 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: fixed rate $ 2,141 $ 893 $ 2,025 $ 1,477 $ 2,279 $ 13,473 $ 22,288 $ 25,319 weighted-average interest rate 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.3 % 5.4 % 5.6 % 5.6 % variable rate $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2018 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion: fixed rate $ 47 $ 2,138 $ 890 $ 2,021 $ 1,473 $ 15,685 $ 22,254 $ 23,170 weighted-average interest rate 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.2 % 5.3 % 5.5 % 5.7 % variable rate (2) $ $ $ $ $ 160 $ $ 160 $ 160 __________________ (1) includes unamortized discount / premium and debt issuance costs. (2) the weighted-average interest rate for our $160 million credit facility borrowing at december 31, 2018 , was 3.77 percent. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of ngls and natural gas, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and energy commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts, and limited proprietary trading activities. our management of the risks associated with these market fluctuations includes maintaining sufficient liquidity, as well as using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors, including changes in energy commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2019 and 2018 , our derivative activity was not material. (see note 18 fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.) 71forward looking statements/risk factors and cautionary statement

natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and demand. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: availability of supplies (including the uncertainties inherent in assessing, estimating, acquiring and developing future natural gas reserves), market demand, volatility of prices, and the availability and cost of capital; inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers); the strength and financial resources of our competitors; development of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and development hazards; costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations (including proposed climate change legislation), environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings; our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in maintenance and construction costs; changes in the current geopolitical situation; our exposure to the credit risk of our customers; risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements, future changes in our credit ratings and the availability and cost of credit; risks associated with future weather conditions; acts of terrorism; additional risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking 23 table of contents statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. risks related to the restructuring we did not seek a vote of our shareholders in connection with the restructuring. if there is a determination that such a vote was required, the resulting consequences could impact us. section 271 of the delaware general corporation law (the dgcl ) generally requires a corporation to obtain authorization from the holders of a majority of its outstanding shares if the corporation intends to sell all or substantially all of its assets. we do not believe the restructuring constituted a sale of all or substantially all of our assets because of, among other things, the portion of our assets involved, the significance of our assets and businesses that were not transferred and the facts that we retain control of all of the assets involved and over an 80% interest in the cash flows therefrom. as such, we did not seek a vote of our shareholders in connection with the restructuring. there is a limited body of delaware case law interpreting the phrase all or substantially all, and there is no precise established definition. we cannot assure you that the restructuring did not constitute a sale of all or substantially all of our assets and, therefore, that a shareholder vote was not required. if such a shareholder vote were determined to be required, the resulting consequences could impact us and could include (among other consequences) our shareholders asserting claims against us, some or all of which could ultimately be successful. we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the restructuring. we may not realize the benefits that we anticipate from the dropdown for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, if any of the matters identified as risks in this risk factors section were to occur. if we do not realize the anticipated benefits from the restructuring for any reason, our business may be materially adversely affected. risks inherent to our industry and business the long-term financial condition of our gas pipeline and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets, and the prices of and market demand for natural gas. the development of the additional natural gas reserves that are essential for our gas pipeline and midstream businesses to thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production, gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems. low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, including environmental regulations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development and production of additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline transportation and import and export of natural gas supplies, adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our gathering, transportation and processing facilities. 24 table of contents production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will also naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. additionally, the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. accordingly, to maintain or increase the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas transported on or gathered through our pipelines and cash flows associated with the gathering and transportation of natural gas, our customers must compete with others to obtain adequate supplies of natural gas. in addition, if natural gas prices in the supply basins connected to our pipeline systems are higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions, our ability to compete with other transporters may be negatively impacted on a short-term basis, as well as with respect to our long-term recontracting activities. if new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply areas, if natural gas supplies are diverted to serve other markets, or if environmental regulators restrict new natural gas drilling, the overall volume of natural gas transported, gathered, and stored on our system would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, new lng import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transportation facilities. significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand and cause a termination of our transportation and storage contracts or a reduction in throughput on our system. higher natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in our long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on our gas pipelines systems. also, lower natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the production of natural gas resulting in reduced contracts or throughput on our gas pipelines systems. as a result, significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. prices for ngls, natural gas and other commodities are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of certain segments of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of ngls, natural gas, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities. price volatility and relative price levels may impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. the markets for ngls, natural gas and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, petroleum, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and level of foreign imports; 25 table of contents domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; volatility in the natural gas markets; the overall economic environment; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold; the adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate change. we might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets. our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts may consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including contracts for natural gas, ngls and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash throughout the united states. if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage, it could negatively affect our results of operations. in the past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. in certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. if such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our contracts, we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. in addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our counterparties. despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. if the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty obligation is inadequate, we will suffer a loss. a general downturn in the economy and tightening of global credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than we have expected. significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves. our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations and debt and equity issuances. future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas, and our success in developing and producing new reserves. if our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we may not be able to access additional bank debt, issue debt or equity securities or access other methods of financing on an economic basis to meet our capital expenditure budget. as a result, our capital expenditure plans may have to be adjusted. failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business. the growth of our exploration production business depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. we may not be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. if natural gas prices increase, our costs for additional reserves would also increase; conversely if natural gas prices decrease, it could make it more difficult to fund the replacement of our reserves. exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves. our past success rate for drilling projects should not be considered a predictor of future commercial success. we do not always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our drilling operations. the new wells we drill or participate in may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in wells we drill or participate in. the cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. our efforts will be unprofitable if we drill dry wells or wells that are 26 table of contents productive but do not produce enough reserves to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment, skilled labor, capital or transportation; unexpected drilling conditions or problems; regulations and regulatory approvals; changes or anticipated changes in energy prices; compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements. estimating reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties. negative revisions to reserve estimates, oil and gas prices or assumptions as to future natural gas prices may lead to decreased earnings, losses, or impairment of oil and gas assets, including related goodwill. reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. reserves that are proved reserves are those estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects. the process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. the reserve data included in this report represent estimates. in addition, the estimates of future net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be correct. quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment. changes to oil and gas prices in the markets for such commodities may have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve estimates. if negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. these revisions, as well as revisions in the assumptions of future cash flows of these reserves, may also be sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties which would result in a noncash charge to earnings. the revisions could also possibly affect the evaluation of exploration production goodwill for impairment purposes. at december 31, 2009, we had approximately $1 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet. certain of our services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our gas pipeline and midstream businesses provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues we collect for our services. although most of the services provided by our interstate gas pipelines are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. 27 table of contents we may not be able to maintain or replace expiring natural gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis. our primary exposure to market risk for our gas pipelines occurs at the time the terms of their existing transportation and storage contracts expire and are subject to termination. although none of our gas pipelines material contracts are terminable in 2010, upon expiration of the terms we may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers to obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis. the extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including: the level of existing and new competition to deliver natural gas to our markets; the growth in demand for natural gas in our markets; whether the market will continue to support long-term firm contracts; whether our business strategy continues to be successful; the level of competition for natural gas supplies in the production basins serving us; the effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices. any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our risk measurement and hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. although we have systems in place that use various methodologies to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses, these systems might not always be followed or might not always be effective. further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under gaap to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under gaap, must be recorded in our income. this creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to us has occurred during the applicable period. the impact of changes in market prices for ngls and natural gas on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging activities. these hedging arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market prices for ngls or natural gas were to change substantially from the price established by the hedges. in addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: volumes are less than expected; the hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating the risk being hedged; the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments. 28 table of contents we depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. the loss of any of these key customers or the loss of any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our business. our gas pipeline and midstream businesses rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of their revenues. although some of these customers are subject to long-term contracts, extensions or replacements of these contracts may not be renegotiated favorable terms, if at all. the loss of even a portion of the revenues from natural gas, ngls or contracted volumes, as applicable, supplied by these customers, as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, unless we are able to generate comparable revenues from other sources. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and our credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk. we are exposed to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers in the ordinary course of our business. generally our customers are either rated investment grade or otherwise considered credit worthy, or they are required to make pre-payments or otherwise provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including declines in our customers creditworthiness. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write-down or write-off doubtful accounts. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. competition in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our results of operations. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. other companies with which we compete may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. the failure of new sources of natural gas production or lng import terminals to be successfully developed in north america could increase natural gas prices and reduce the demand for our services. new sources of natural gas production in the united states and canada, particularly in areas of shale development are expected to become an increasingly significant component of future u.s. natural gas supplies in north america. additionally, increases in lng supplies are expected to be imported through new lng import terminals, particularly in the gulf coast region. if these additional sources of supply are not developed, natural gas prices could increase and cause consumers of natural gas to turn to alternative energy sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our drilling, production, gathering, processing, storage and transporting activities involve numerous risks that might result in accidents, and other operating risks and hazards. our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards typically associated with the development and exploration for, and the production and transportation of oil and gas. these operating risks include, but are not limited to: fires, blowouts, cratering and explosions; uncontrolled releases of oil, natural gas, ngls or well fluids; collapse of ngl storage caverns; 29 table of contents operator error; pollution and other environmental risks; hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters; aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages; damage inadvertently caused by third party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; risks related to truck and rail loading and unloading; risks related to operating in a marine environment; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies. any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the location of certain segments of our pipelines in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. in spite of our precautions, an event such as those described above could cause considerable harm to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers. such circumstances, including those arising from maintenance and repair activities, could result in service interruptions on segments of our pipeline infrastructure. potential customer impacts arising from service interruptions on segments of our pipeline infrastructure could include limitations on the pipeline ability to satisfy customer requirements, obligations to provide reservations charge credits to customers in times of constrained capacity, and solicitation of existing customers by others for potential new pipeline projects that would compete directly with existing services. such circumstances could materially impact our ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers, with a resulting negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the ability of the insurers we do use to satisfy our claims. we are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business, including environmental accidents that might occur. in addition, we do not maintain business interruption insurance in the type and amount to cover all possible risks of loss. we currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $610 million per occurrence and in the aggregate annually and a deductible of $2 million per occurrence. this insurance covers us, our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury, personal injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. this excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and ngl operations. pollution liability coverage excludes: release of pollutants subsequent to their disposal; release of substances arising from the combustion of fuels that result in acidic deposition, and testing, monitoring, clean-up, containment, treatment or removal of pollutants from property owned, occupied by, rented to, used by or in the care, custody or control of us, our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates. we do not insure onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at river crossings and at certain locations such as compressor stations. we maintain coverage of $300 million per occurrence for physical damage to onshore assets and resulting business interruption caused by terrorist acts. we also maintain coverage of $100 million per occurrence for physical damage to offshore assets caused by terrorist acts, except for our devils tower spar where we maintain limits of $300 million per occurrence for property damage caused by terrorist acts and $105 million per occurrence for resulting business interruption. also, all of our insurance is subject to deductibles. if a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured, it could adversely affect our 30 table of contents operations and financial condition. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. changes in the insurance markets subsequent to hurricane losses in recent years have impacted named windstorm insurance coverage, rates and availability for gulf of mexico area exposures, and we may elect to self insure a portion of our asset portfolio. we cannot assure you that we will in the future be able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would otherwise have obtained prior to these market changes or that the insurance coverage we do obtain will not contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. the occurrence of any operating risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, certain insurance companies that provide coverage to us, including american international group, inc., have experienced negative developments that could impair their ability to pay any of our potential claims. as a result, we could be exposed to greater losses than anticipated and may have to obtain replacement insurance, if available, at a greater cost. execution of our capital projects subjects us to construction risks, increases in labor and materials costs and other risks that may adversely affect financial results. a significant portion of any growth in our gas pipeline and midstream businesses is accomplished through the construction of new pipelines, processing and storage facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities. construction of these facilities is subject to various regulatory, development and operational risks, including: the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; the availability of skilled labor, equipment, and materials to complete expansion projects; potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; impediments on our ability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; the ability to construct projects within estimated costs, including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment, materials, labor, or other factors beyond our control, that may be material; the ability to access capital markets to fund construction projects. any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding, delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs. as a result, new facilities may not achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect results of operations, financial position or cash flows. our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other post-retirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. two of our subsidiaries act as the respective general partners of two different publicly-traded limited partnerships, williams partners l.p. and williams pipeline partners l.p. as such, those subsidiaries operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz and another subsidiary of ours acts as the general partner of wmz. each of these subsidiaries that act as the general partner of a publicly-traded limited partnership 31 table of contents may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to the limited partnership of which it serves as the general partner and to the limited partners of such limited partnership. activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interests is found to exist. our control of the general partners of two different publicly traded partnerships may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise (i) between the two publicly-traded partnerships as well as (ii) between a publicly-traded partnership, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material. potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosures in the future, which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance. regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial disclosures, companies relationships with their independent registered public accounting firms, and retirement plan practices. we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies or the energy industry or in our operations specifically. in addition, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) or the sec could enact new accounting standards that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. any significant change in accounting standards or disclosure requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects. we currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries where we have interests or in which we might explore development, acquisition or investment opportunities present risks of delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain nonrecourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments. operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. in certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to u.s. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. in addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. in such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. we may or may not put contracts in place designed to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. we have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations. our operating results for certain segments of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. revenues from certain segments of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. 32 table of contents additionally, changes in the price of natural gas could benefit one of our business units, but disadvantage another. for example, our exploration production business may benefit from higher natural gas prices, and midstream, which uses gas as a feedstock, may not. risks related to strategy and financing our debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to create liens supporting indebtedness, merge, sell substantially all of our assets, make certain distributions, and incur additional debt. in addition, our debt agreements contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. these covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in, expand or pursue our business activities and prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by many events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. if market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our current assumptions about future economic conditions turn out to be incorrect or unexpected events occur, our ability to comply with these covenants may be significantly impaired. we cannot assure you that our future operating results will be sufficient to comply with the covenants or, in the event of a default under any of our debt agreements, to remedy that default. our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements could result in events of default. upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. certain payment defaults or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt agreement. such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. if an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under such debt agreements. our ability to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or obtain future credit on favorable terms, if at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. future disruptions in the global credit markets may make equity and debt markets less accessible, create a shortage in the availability of credit and lead to credit market volatility. in 2008, public equity markets experienced significant declines and global credit markets experienced a shortage in overall liquidity and a resulting disruption in the availability of credit. future disruptions in the global financial marketplace, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of financial institutions, may make equity and debt markets inaccessible and adversely affect the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future. we have availability under our existing bank credit facilities, but our ability to borrow under those facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders fail to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us. adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. a slowdown in the economy has the potential to negatively impact our businesses in many ways. included among these potential negative impacts are reduced demand and lower prices for our products and services, increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers and a reduction in our credit ratings (either due to tighter rating standards or the negative impacts described above), which could result in reducing our access to credit markets, raising the cost of such access or requiring us to provide additional collateral to our counterparties. 33 table of contents a downgrade of our credit ratings could impact our liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business, and maintaining current credit ratings is under the control of independent third parties. a downgrade of our credit rating might increase our cost of borrowing and would require us to post additional collateral with third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. our ability to access capital markets would also be limited by a downgrade of our credit rating and other disruptions. such disruptions could include: economic downturns; deteriorating capital market conditions; declining market prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids and other commodities; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies; the overall health of the energy industry, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. the analysis includes a number of criteria including, but not limited to, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. our corporate family credit rating and the credit ratings of transco and northwest pipeline are rated investment grade by standard poor s, moody corporation, and fitch ratings, ltd., and our senior unsecured debt ratings are rated investment grade by moody and fitch. credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold investments in the rated entity. ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies, and no assurance can be given that the credit rating agencies will continue to assign us investment grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their criteria for investment grade ratios or that our senior unsecured debt rating will be raised to investment grade by all of the credit rating agencies. risks related to regulations that affect our industry our natural gas sales, transmission, and storage operations are subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. our interstate natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations conducted through our gas pipelines business are subject to the ferc rules and regulations in accordance with the nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978. the ferc regulatory authority extends to: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms and conditions of service, including initiation and discontinuation of services; certification and construction of new facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; relationships with marketing functions within williams involved in certain aspects of the natural gas business; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas. regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our business. regulatory decisions could also affect our costs for compression, processing and dehydration of natural gas, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations. the ferc has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased competition throughout the industry. in a number of key markets, interstate pipelines are now facing 34 table of contents competitive pressure from other major pipeline systems, enabling local distribution companies and end users to choose a transportation provider based on considerations other than location. we are subject to risks associated with climate change. there is a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs) may be linked to climate change. climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts and the regulation of ghgs have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing our products and services, the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks. costs of environmental liabilities and complying with existing and future environmental regulations, including those related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, could exceed our current expectations. our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial, state and municipal laws and regulations. such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, extraction, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment, and in connection with the operation, maintenance, abandonment and reclamation of our facilities. various governmental authorities, including the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) and analogous state agencies and the united states department of homeland security, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. compliance with environmental laws requires significant expenditures, including clean up costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of natural gas and wastes on, under, or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. although we do not expect that the costs of complying with current environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, no assurance can be given that the costs of complying with environmental laws in the future will not have such an effect. legislative and regulatory responses related to ghgs and climate change creates the potential for financial risk. the united states congress and certain states have for some time been considering various forms of legislation related to ghg emissions. there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of ghgs. in addition, increased public awareness and concern may result in more state, federal, and international proposals to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions. several bills have been introduced in the united states congress that would compel ghg emission reductions. in june of 2009, the u.s. house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act which is intended to decrease annual ghg emissions through a variety of measures, including a cap and trade system 35 table of contents which limits the amount of ghgs that may be emitted and incentives to reduce the nation dependence on traditional energy sources. the u.s. senate is currently considering similar legislation, and numerous states have also announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce ghgs. in addition, on december 7, 2009, the epa issued a final determination that six ghgs are a threat to public safety and welfare. this determination is the latest in a series of epa actions in 2009 which could ultimately lead to the direct regulation of ghg emissions in our industry by the epa under the clean air act. while it is not clear whether or when any federal or state climate change laws or regulations will be passed, any of these actions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities, and (iii) administer and manage any ghg emissions program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. to the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of ghgs as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. we make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. if the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions may change. our regulatory rate structure and our contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new environmental regulations. also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for certain development projects. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our results of operations. if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipeline and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipeline and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or other facilities were to become unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to the pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. further, although there are laws and regulations designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions, some companies may fail to provide fair and equal access to their transportation systems or may not provide sufficient transportation capacity for other market participants. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our businesses are subject to complex government regulations. the operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us, our facilities or our customers, and future changes in laws and regulations might have a detrimental effect on our business. specifically, the colorado oil gas conservation commission has enacted new rules in 2009 which increased our costs of permitting and environmental compliance and the time required to obtain permits, which may have a material effect on our results of operations. 36 table of contents legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry and capital markets have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being either proposed or implemented. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in which we are a named defendant. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing and continue to adversely affect our business as a whole. we might see these adverse effects continue as a result of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters against us arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. risks related to employees, outsourcing of noncore support activities, and technology institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility might not be adequately preserved. in certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. as these employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. failure of or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing relationships. although we have taken steps to build a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our outsourcing providers and to closely monitor their performance, a deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be able to conduct our business. the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to similar losses of institutional knowledge or disruptions. certain of our accounting, information technology, application development, and help desk services are currently provided by an outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide services to us present similar risks of business operations located outside of the united states previously discussed, including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. risks related to weather, other natural phenomena and business disruption our assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. insurance may be inadequate, and in some instances, we have been unable to obtain insurance on commercially 37 table of contents reasonable terms, or insurance may not be available. a significant disruption in operations or a significant liability for which we were not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. our customers energy needs vary with weather conditions. to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change or demand is impacted by regulations associated with climate change, customers energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes, leading to either increased investment or decreased revenues. acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport or distribute natural gas, natural gas liquids or other commodities. acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 79 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. the majority of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. in february 2010, we completed a strategic restructuring that involved retiring $3 billion of our debt and issuing $3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes of wpz. (see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments included in continuing operations as of december 31, 2009 and 2008. long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. fair value december 31, 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 thereafter(1) total 2009 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion(2): fixed rate $ 15 $ 936 $ 953 $ $ $ 6,119 $ 8,023 $ 8,905 interest rate 7.7 % 7.7 % 7.7 % 7.7 % 7.7 % 8.0 % variable rate $ $ $ 250 $ $ $ $ 250 $ 237 interest rate(3) fair value december 31, 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 thereafter(1) total 2008 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion(2): fixed rate $ 15 $ $ 927 $ 953 $ $ 5,551 $ 7,446 $ 5,907 interest rate 7.6 % 7.6 % 7.6 % 7.6 % 7.5 % 7.9 % variable rate $ $ $ $ 250 $ $ $ 250 $ 233 interest rate(3) (1) includes unamortized discount and premium. (2) excludes capital leases. (3) the interest rate at december 31, 2009 and 2008 is libor plus 1 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of natural gas and ngls, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts and our proprietary trading activities. we manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors, including changes in energy-commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. we measure the risk in our portfolios using a value-at-risk methodology to estimate the potential one-day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios. value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolios. our value-at-risk model uses a monte carlo method to simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result of changes in commodity prices, there 79 table of contents is a 95 percent probability that the one-day loss in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at risk. the simulation method uses historical correlations and market forward prices and volatilities. in applying the value-at-risk methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical movements affect the positions or would cause any potential liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one-day holding period to execute. while a one-day holding period has historically been the industry standard, a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints. we segregate our derivative contracts into trading and nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. we calculate value at risk separately for these two categories. contracts designated as normal purchases or sales and nonderivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk. trading our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity price-risk exposure. the fair value of our trading derivatives is a net liability of $11 million at december 31, 2009. our value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was less than $1 million at december 31, 2009 and 2008. nontrading our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the following activities: segment commodity price risk exposure exploration production natural gas sales midstream natural gas purchases ngl purchases and sales gas marketing services natural gas purchases and sales the fair value of our nontrading derivatives is a net asset of $99 million at december 31, 2009. the value at risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes was $34 million at december 31, 2009, and $33 million at december 31, 2008. during the year ended december 31, 2009, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $37 million to a low of $27 million. certain of the derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes are accounted for as cash flow hedges. of the total fair value of nontrading derivatives, cash flow hedges have a net asset value of $178 million as of december 31, 2009. though these contracts are included in our value-at-risk calculation, any change in the fair value of the effective portion of these hedge contracts would generally not be reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item affects earnings. trading policy we have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk management activities. these policies cover authority and delegation thereof in addition to control requirements, authorized commodities and term and exposure limitations. value-at-risk is limited in aggregate and calculated at a 95 percent confidence level. foreign currency risk we have international investments that could affect our financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or the economic conditions in foreign countries. international investments accounted for under the cost method totaled $2 million at december 31, 2009, and $17 million at december 31, 2008. these investments are primarily in nonpublicly traded companies for which it is 80 table of contents not practicable to estimate fair value. we believe that we can realize the carrying value of these investments considering the status of the operations of the companies underlying these investments. net assets of consolidated foreign operations, whose functional currency is the local currency, are located primarily in canada and approximate 6 percent and 5 percent of our net assets at december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. however, these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position, due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the respective functional currencies against the u.s. dollar would have changed stockholders equity by approximately $98 million at december 31, 2009. 81 table of contentsrisk factors 21 risk factors forward-looking statements and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 certain matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, seeks, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, intends, might, goals, objectives, targets, planned, potential, projects, scheduled, will or other similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding: amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; financial condition and liquidity; business strategy; estimates of proved gas and oil reserves; reserve potential; development drilling potential; cash flow from operations or results of operations; seasonality of certain business segments; natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil prices and demand. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that 21 table of contents will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: availability of supplies (including the uncertainties inherent in assessing, estimating, acquiring and developing future natural gas and oil reserves), market demand, volatility of prices, and the availability and cost of capital; inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers); the strength and financial resources of our competitors; development of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and development hazards; costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations (including climate change legislation and/or potential additional regulation of drilling and completion of wells), environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings; our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in maintenance and construction costs; changes in the current geopolitical situation; our exposure to the credit risk of our customers; risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements, future changes in our credit ratings and the availability and cost of credit; risks associated with future weather conditions; acts of terrorism; additional risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. 22 table of contents because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. risks related to separation plan if our plan to separate our exploration and production business is delayed or not completed, our stock price may decline and our growth potential may not be enhanced. on february 16, 2011, we announced that our board of directors approved pursuing a plan to divide our businesses into two separate, publicly traded corporations. the plan calls for a separation of our exploration and production business through an initial public offering of up to 20 percent of the corporation holding that business in 2011 and a tax-free spinoff of our remaining interest in that corporation to our shareholders in 2012. the completion and timing of each of the transactions is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the macroeconomic environment, credit markets, equity markets, energy prices, the receipt of a tax opinion from counsel and/or internal revenue service rulings, final approvals from our board of directors and other customary matters. we may not complete the transactions at all or complete the transactions on the timeline or on the terms that we announced. if the transactions are not completed or delayed, our stock price may decline and our growth potential may not be enhanced. risks inherent in our business the long-term financial condition of our gas pipeline and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets, and the prices of and market demand for natural gas. the development of the additional natural gas reserves that are essential for our gas pipeline and midstream businesses to thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production, gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems. low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, including environmental regulations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development and production of additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline transportation and import and export of natural gas supplies, adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our gathering, transportation and processing facilities. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline systems will also naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. additionally, the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. accordingly, to maintain or increase the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas transported on or gathered through our pipeline systems and cash flows associated with the gathering and transportation of natural gas, our customers must compete with others to obtain adequate supplies of natural gas. in addition, if natural gas prices in the supply basins connected to our pipeline systems are higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions, our ability to compete with other transporters may be negatively impacted on a short-term basis, as well as with respect to our long-term recontracting activities. if new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply areas, if natural gas supplies are diverted to serve other markets, if development in new supply basins where we do not have significant gathering or pipeline systems reduces demand for our services, or if environmental regulators restrict new natural gas drilling, the overall volume of natural gas transported, gathered and stored on our system would decline, which could have a material 23 table of contents adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, new lng import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transportation facilities. significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand and cause a termination of our transportation and storage contracts or a reduction in throughput on the gas pipeline systems. higher natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on our gas pipeline systems. also, lower natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the production of natural gas resulting in reduced contracts or throughput on the gas pipeline systems. as a result, significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our gas pipeline business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. prices for ngls, natural gas and other commodities, including oil, are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of certain segments of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of ngls, natural gas, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities. price volatility can impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. any of the foregoing can also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the markets for ngls, natural gas and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, oil, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and level of foreign imports; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; volatility in the natural gas and oil markets; the overall economic environment; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold; the adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate change. 24 table of contents we might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets. our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts may consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including contracts for natural gas, ngls, oil and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash throughout the united states. if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage, it could negatively affect our results of operations. in the past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. in certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. if such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our contracts, we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. in addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our counterparties. despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. if the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty obligation is inadequate, we will suffer a loss. downturns in the economy or disruptions in the global credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than we expect. significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves. our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations and debt and equity issuances. future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas and oil, and our success in developing and producing new reserves. if our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we may not be able to access additional bank debt, issue debt or equity securities or access other methods of financing on an economic basis to meet our capital expenditure budget. as a result, our capital expenditure plans may have to be adjusted. failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business. the growth of our exploration production business depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable. our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. we may not be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. if natural gas or oil prices increase, our costs for additional reserves would also increase; conversely if natural gas or oil prices decrease, it could make it more difficult to fund the replacement of our reserves. exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves. our past success rate for drilling projects should not be considered a predictor of future commercial success. we do not always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our drilling operations. the new wells we drill or participate in may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in wells we drill or participate in. the cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. our efforts will be unprofitable if we drill dry wells or wells that are productive but do not produce enough reserves to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment, skilled labor, capital or transportation; unexpected drilling conditions or problems; regulations and regulatory approvals; changes or anticipated changes in energy prices; compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements. 25 table of contents estimating reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties. negative revisions to reserve estimates, oil and gas prices or assumptions as to future natural gas prices may lead to decreased earnings, losses, or impairment of oil and gas assets. reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. reserves that are proved reserves are those estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects. the process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. the reserve data included in this report represent estimates. in addition, the estimates of future net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be correct. quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment. changes to oil and gas prices in the markets for such commodities may have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve estimates. if negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. these revisions, as well as revisions in the assumptions of future cash flows of these reserves, may also be sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties which would result in a noncash charge to earnings. certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues they collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. we may not be able to maintain or replace expiring natural gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis. our primary exposure to market risk for our gas pipelines occurs at the time the terms of their existing transportation and storage contracts expire and are subject to termination. upon expiration of the terms we may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers to obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis. the extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including: the level of existing and new competition to deliver natural gas to our markets; the growth in demand for natural gas in our markets; whether the market will continue to support long-term firm contracts; whether our business strategy continues to be successful; the level of competition for natural gas supplies in the production basins serving us; 26 table of contents the effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices. any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our risk measurement and hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. although we have systems in place that use various methodologies to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses, these systems might not always be followed or might not always be effective. further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used and may in the future use fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under gaap, must be recorded in our income. this creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to us has occurred during the applicable period. the impact of changes in market prices for ngls and natural gas on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging activities. these hedging arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market prices for ngls or natural gas were to change substantially from the price established by the hedges. in addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: volumes are less than expected; the hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating the risk being hedged; the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments. the adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities. in july 2010, federal legislation known as the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the act) was enacted. the act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including oil and gas hedging transactions. among other things, the act provides for the creation of position limits for certain derivatives transactions, as well as requiring certain transactions to be cleared on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required. the final impact of the act on our hedging activities is uncertain at this time due to the requirement that the sec and the commodities futures trading commission (cftc) promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within 360 days from the date of enactment. these new rules and 27 table of contents regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts or reduce the availability of derivatives. although we believe the derivative contracts that we enter into should not be impacted by position limits and should be exempt from the requirement to clear transactions through a central exchange or to post collateral, the impact upon our businesses will depend on the outcome of the implementing regulations adopted by the cftc. depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the cftc, we might in the future be required to provide cash collateral for our commodities hedging transactions under circumstances in which we do not currently post cash collateral. posting of such additional cash collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our cash available for capital expenditures. a requirement to post cash collateral could therefore reduce our ability to execute hedges to reduce commodity price uncertainty and thus protect cash flows. if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. we depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. the loss of any of these key customers or the loss of any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our business. our gas pipeline and midstream businesses rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of their revenues. although some of these customers are subject to long-term contracts, extensions or replacements of these contracts may not be renegotiated on favorable terms, if at all. the loss of all, or even a portion of the revenues from natural gas, ngls or contracted volumes, as applicable, supplied by these customers, as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, unless we are able to acquire comparable volumes from other sources. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and our credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk. we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including declines in our customers creditworthiness. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write-down or write-off doubtful accounts. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. other companies with which we compete may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. similarly, a highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. as a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 28 table of contents our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which they may not be adequately insured. there are operational risks associated with drilling for, production, gathering, transporting, storage, processing and treating of natural gas and the fractionation and storage of ngls, including: hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, extreme weather conditions, and other natural disasters; aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages; uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), ngls, brine or industrial chemicals; collapse of storage caverns; operator error; damage inadvertently caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; pollution and environmental risks; fires, explosions, craterings and blowouts; risks related to truck and rail loading and unloading; risks related to operating in a marine environment; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies. any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. in spite of our precautions, an event such as those described above could cause considerable harm to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers. our costs of maintaining or repairing our facilities may exceed our expectations and the ferc or competition in our markets may not allow us to recover such costs in the rates we charge for our services. we could experience unexpected leaks or ruptures on our gas pipeline and midstream systems, or be required by regulatory authorities to undertake modifications to our systems that could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations if the costs of maintaining or repairing our facilities exceed current expectations and the ferc or competition in our markets do not allow us to recover such costs in the rates we charge for our service. we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. we are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business, including environmental accidents. we do not maintain insurance in the type and amount to cover all possible risks of loss. we currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $610 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate with a $2 million per occurrence deductible. this insurance covers us, our subsidiaries, and certain of our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. this excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and ngl operations. 29 table of contents although we maintain property insurance on property we own, lease or are responsible to insure, the policy may not cover the full replacement cost of all damaged assets or the entire amount of business interruption loss we may experience. in addition, certain perils may be excluded from coverage or sub-limited. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. we may elect to self insure a portion of our risks. we do not insure our onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at certain locations such as river crossings and compressor stations. only certain offshore key-assets are covered for property damage and the resulting business interruption when loss is due to a named windstorm event and coverage for loss caused by a named windstorm is significantly sub-limited. all of our insurance is subject to deductibles. if a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured it could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. in addition, any insurance company that provides coverage to us may experience negative developments that could impair their ability to pay any of our claims. as a result, we could be exposed to greater losses than anticipated and may have to obtain replacement insurance, if available, at a greater cost. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to repay our debt. execution of our capital projects subjects us to construction risks, increases in labor costs and materials, and other risks that may adversely affect financial results. the growth in our gas pipeline and midstream businesses may be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, processing or treating pipelines and facilities or natural gas liquids fractionation or storage facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities. construction or expansion of these facilities is subject to various regulatory, development and operational risks, including: the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; the availability of skilled labor, equipment, and materials to complete expansion projects; potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; impediments on our ability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; the ability to construct projects within estimated costs, including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment, materials, labor, or other factors beyond our control, that may be material; the ability to access capital markets to fund construction projects. any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding, delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs. as a result, new facilities may not achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 30 table of contents one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, williams partners l.p. as such, this subsidiary operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz, a publicly-traded limited partnership. this subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to wpz as the general partner and to the limited partners of wpz. activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interests is found to exist. our control of the general partner of wpz may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise between wpz, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material. potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosures in the future, which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance. regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial disclosures, and companies relationships with their independent public accounting firms. it remains unclear what new laws or regulations will be adopted, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact of that any such new laws or regulations could have. in addition, the financial accounting standards board, the sec or ferc could enact new accounting standards or ferc orders that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. any significant change in accounting standards or disclosure requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects. we currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries where we have interests or in which we might explore development, acquisition or investment opportunities present risks of delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain nonrecourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments. operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. in certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to u.s. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. in addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. in such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. we may or may not put contracts in place designed to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. we have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations. our operating results for certain segments of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. revenues from certain segments of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in 31 table of contents the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. additionally, changes in the price of natural gas could benefit one of our businesses, but disadvantage another. for example, our exploration production business may benefit from higher natural gas prices, and our midstream business, which uses gas as a feedstock, may not. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited term. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and cash flows. risks related to strategy and financing our debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may limit our access to credit and adversely affect our ability to operate our business. certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to grant liens to support indebtedness, merge or sell substantially all of our assets, make certain distributions during an event of default, and incur additional debt. in addition, our debt agreements contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. these covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in, expand or pursue our business activities and prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. if market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our current assumptions about future economic conditions turn out to be incorrect or unexpected events occur, our ability to comply with these covenants may be significantly impaired. our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements could result in events of default. upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. certain payment defaults or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt agreement. such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. if an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under such debt agreements. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management discussion and analysis of financial condition and liquidity. our ability to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or obtain future credit on favorable terms, if at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. 32 table of contents future disruptions in the global credit markets may make equity and debt markets less accessible, create a shortage in the availability of credit and lead to credit market volatility, which could disrupt our financing plans and limit our ability to grow. in 2008, public equity markets experienced significant declines and global credit markets experienced a shortage in overall liquidity and a resulting disruption in the availability of credit. future disruptions in the global financial marketplace, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of financial institutions, could make equity and debt markets inaccessible and adversely affect the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future. we have availability under our existing bank credit facilities, but our ability to borrow under those facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders fails to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us. adverse economic conditions could negatively affect our results of operations. a slowdown in the economy has the potential to negatively impact our businesses in many ways. included among these potential negative impacts are reduced demand and lower prices for our products and services, increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers and a reduction in our credit ratings (either due to tighter rating standards or the negative impacts described above), which could result in reducing our access to credit markets, raising the cost of such access or requiring us to provide additional collateral to our counterparties. a downgrade of our credit ratings could impact our liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business, and independent third parties determine our credit ratings outside of our control. a downgrade of our credit rating might increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to post collateral with third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. our ability to access capital markets could also be limited by a downgrade of our credit rating and other disruptions. such disruptions could include: economic downturns; deteriorating capital market conditions; declining market prices for natural gas, ngls and other commodities; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies; the overall health of the energy industry, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. the analysis includes a number of criteria including, but not limited to, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold investments in the rated entity. ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies, and no assurance can be given that we will maintain our current credit ratings or that our senior unsecured debt rating will be raised to investment grade by all of the credit rating agencies. risks related to regulations that affect our industry our gas pipelines could be subject to penalties and fines if they fail to comply with ferc regulations. our gas pipeline transportation and storage operations are regulated by ferc. should our gas pipelines fail to comply with all applicable ferc administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, they could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. under the energy policy act of 2005, ferc has civil penalty authority under the natural gas act (nga) to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1,000,000 per day for each violation. any material penalties or fines imposed by ferc could have a material adverse impact on our gas pipeline business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the natural gas sales, transportation and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage 33 table of contents rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. the natural gas sales, transmission and storage operations of the gas pipelines are subject to federal, state and local regulatory authorities. specifically, their interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. the federal regulation extends to such matters as: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms, and conditions of service, including initiation and discontinuation of service; the types of services the gas pipelines may offer their customers; certification and construction of new facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas. under the nga, ferc has authority to regulate providers of natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services in interstate commerce, and such providers may only charge rates that have been determined to be just and reasonable by ferc. in addition, ferc prohibits providers from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business. unlike other interstate pipelines that own facilities in the offshore gulf of mexico, transco charges its transportation customers a separate fee to access its offshore facilities. the separate charge is referred to as an it feeder charge. the it feeder rate is charged only when gas is actually transported on the facilities and typically it is paid by producers or marketers. because the it feeder rate is typically paid by producers and marketers, it generally results in netback prices to producers that are slightly lower than the netbacks realized by producers transporting on other interstate pipelines. this rate design disparity could result in producers bypassing transco offshore facilities in favor of alternative transportation facilities. the rates, terms and conditions for interstate gas pipeline services are set forth in ferc-approved tariffs. any successful complaint or protest against the rates of the gas pipelines could have an adverse impact on their revenues associated with providing transportation services. in addition, there is a risk that rates set by ferc in future rate cases filed by the gas pipelines will be inadequate to recover increases in operating costs or to sustain an adequate return on capital investments. there is also the risk that higher rates would cause their customers to look for alternative ways to transport natural gas. we are subject to risks associated with climate change. there is a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs) may be linked to climate change. climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts and the regulation of ghgs have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing our products and services, the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks. for further information regarding risks to our business arising from climate change related legislation, please read the discussion below under our operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and could exceed current expectations. 34 table of contents our operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and could exceed current expectations. the risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in natural gas drilling and well completion, gathering, transportation, storage, processing and treating, and in the fractionation and storage of ngls, and we may incur substantial environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of these types of operations. our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing environmental protection, the discharge of materials into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. these laws include: clean air act (caa) and analogous state laws, which impose obligations related to air emissions; clean water act (cwa), and analogous state laws, which regulate discharge of wastewaters from our facilities to state and federal waters; comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (cercla), and analogous state laws, which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal; resource conservation and recovery act (rcra), and analogous state laws, which impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities. various governmental authorities, including the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) and analogous state agencies and the u.s. department of homeland security, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. there is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our business, some of which may be material, due to our handling of the products we gather, transport, process, fractionate and store, air emissions related to our operations, historical industry operations, waste disposal practices, and the prior use of flow meters containing mercury. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, including cercla, rcra, and analogous state laws, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of natural gas and wastes on, under, or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing operations, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. in addition, increasingly strict laws, regulations and enforcement policies could materially increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. our business may be adversely affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non-compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operations. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation or construction of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be 35 table of contents prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. in addition, legislative and regulatory responses related to ghgs and climate change creates the potential for financial risk. the u.s. congress and certain states have for some time been considering various forms of legislation related to ghg emissions. there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of ghgs. in addition, increased public awareness and concern may result in more state, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions. numerous states have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce ghgs. in addition, on december 7, 2009, the epa issued a final determination that six ghgs are a threat to public safety and welfare. this determination could lead to the direct regulation of ghg emissions in our industry under the epa interpretation of its authority and obligations under the caa. the recent actions of the epa and the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities, and (iii) administer and manage any ghg emissions program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process commonly used in natural gas production. legislation to further regulate hydraulic fracturing has been proposed in congress and the u.s. department of interior has announced plans to formalize obligations for disclosure of chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. in addition, some state and local authorities have considered or formalized new rules related to hydraulic fracturing and enacted moratoria on such activities. we cannot predict whether any federal, state or local legislation or regulation will be enacted in this area and if so, what its provisions would be. if additional levels of reporting, regulation and permitting were required, our operations and those of our customers could be adversely affected. we make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. if the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions may change, and any new capital costs incurred to comply with such changes may not be recoverable under our regulatory rate structure or our customer contracts. in addition, new environmental laws and regulations might adversely affect our products and activities, including drilling, processing, fractionation, storage and transportation, as well as waste management and air emissions. for instance, federal and state agencies could impose additional safety requirements, any of which could affect our profitability. if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or other facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to the pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 36 table of contents our businesses are subject to complex government regulations. the operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us, our facilities or our customers, and future changes in laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. for example, several ruptures on third party pipelines have occurred recently. in response, various legislative and regulatory reforms associated with pipeline safety and integrity have been proposed, including reforms that would require increased periodic inspections, installation of additional valves and other equipment on our gas pipelines and subjecting additional pipelines (including gathering facilities) to more stringent regulation. such reforms, if adopted, could significantly increase our costs. legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in increased regulation being either proposed or implemented. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in which we are a named defendant. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters against us including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. the recently lifted drilling moratorium in the gulf of mexico and potentially more stringent regulations and permitting requirements on drilling in the gulf of mexico could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the drilling moratorium in the gulf of mexico (in force from may to october 2010) impacted our production handling, gathering and transportation operations through production delays which reduced volumes of natural gas and oil delivered to our platform, pipeline and gathering facilities in 2010. in addition, the bureau of ocean energy management, regulation and enforcement continues to develop more stringent drilling and permitting requirements for producers in the gulf of mexico which could cause delays in production or new drilling. a significant decline or delay in production volumes in the gulf of mexico could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows through reduced production handling activities, gathering and transportation volumes, processing activities or other midstream services. risks related to employees, outsourcing of noncore support activities, and technology institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility might not be adequately preserved. in certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. as these employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. 37 table of contents failure of or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing relationships. although we have taken steps to build a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our outsourcing providers and to closely monitor their performance, a deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be able to conduct our business. the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to similar losses of institutional knowledge or disruptions. certain of our accounting, information technology, application development, and help desk services are currently provided by an outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide services to us present similar risks of business operations located outside of the united states previously discussed, including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. risks related to weather, other natural phenomena and business disruption our assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. insurance may be inadequate, and in some instances, we have been unable to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms, or insurance has not been available at all. a significant disruption in operations or a significant liability for which we were not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. our customers energy needs vary with weather conditions. to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change or demand is impacted by regulations associated with climate change, customers energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes, leading either to increased investment or decreased revenues. acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport or distribute natural gas, ngls or other commodities. acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 78 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. the majority of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. any borrowings under our credit facilities could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. the tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2010 and 2009. long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. fair value december 31, 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 thereafter(1) total 2010 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion(2):

interest rate(3) (1) includes unamortized discount and premium. (2) excludes capital leases. (3) the interest rate at december 31, 2009 was libor plus 1 percent. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of natural gas, ngl and crude, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and energy commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts and our proprietary trading activities. we manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors, including changes in energy commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. (see note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements.) we measure the risk in our portfolios using a value-at-risk methodology to estimate the potential one-day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios. value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolios. our value-at-risk model uses a monte carlo method to simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent probability that the one-day loss in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at risk. the simulation method uses historical correlations and 78 table of contents market forward prices and volatilities. in applying the value-at-risk methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical movements affect the positions or would cause any potential liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolios in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one-day holding period to execute. while a one-day holding period has historically been the industry standard, a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints. we segregate our derivative contracts into trading and nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. we calculate value at risk separately for these two categories. contracts designated as normal purchases or sales and nonderivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk. trading our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity price-risk exposure. the fair value of our trading derivatives was a net asset of $2 million at december 31, 2010. the value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was less than $1 million at december 31, 2010 and december 31, 2009. nontrading our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the following activities: segment commodity price risk exposure williams partners natural gas purchases ngl sales exploration production natural gas purchases and sales other ngl purchases the fair value of our nontrading derivatives was a net asset of $282 million at december 31, 2010. the value at risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes was $24 million at december 31, 2010, and $34 million at december 31, 2009. during the year ended december 31, 2010, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $33 million to a low of $21 million. the decrease in value at risk primarily reflects the realization of certain derivative positions and the market price impact, partially offset by new derivative contracts. certain of the derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes are accounted for as cash flow hedges. of the total fair value of nontrading derivatives, cash flow hedges had a net asset value of $266 million as of december 31, 2010. though these contracts are included in our value-at-risk calculation, any changes in the fair value of the effective portion of these hedge contracts would generally not be reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item affects earnings. trading policy we have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk management activities. these policies cover authority and delegation thereof in addition to control requirements, authorized commodities and term and exposure limitations. value-at-risk is limited in aggregate and calculated at a 95 percent confidence level. foreign currency risk net assets of our consolidated foreign operations, whose functional currency is the local currency, are located primarily in canada and approximate 8 percent and 6 percent of our net assets at december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. however, these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position, due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the respective functional currencies against the u.s. dollar would have changed stockholders equity by approximately $117 million at december 31, 2010. 79 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 85 qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio, which was significantly reduced in 2004 by early retirements and payments. we reduced our total long-term debt, including current portion, from approximately $12 billion at december 31, 2003, to approximately $8 billion at december 31, 2004 (see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements). the majority of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected life of our operating assets. the tables below provide information as of december 31, 2004 and 2003, about our interest rate risk sensitive instruments. long-term debt in the tables represents

(3) the marketable equity securities matured in 2004. the consolidated balance sheet classification was determined based on the expected term of the underlying collateral requirement. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, power, crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids and additionally to other market factors, such as market volatility and commodity price correlations, including correlations between crude oil and gas prices and between natural gas and power prices. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts and our proprietary trading activities. we manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations using various derivatives. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to changes in energy-commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are 85 table of contents transacted, and changes in interest rates. we measure the risk in our portfolios using a value-at-risk methodology to estimate the potential one-day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios. value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolios. the value-at-risk model assumes that, as a result of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent probability that the one-day loss in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at risk. beginning in 2004, the value-at-risk model uses a monte carlo method to simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices. the simulation method uses historical correlations and market forward prices and volatilities. in applying the value-at-risk methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical movements affect the positions or would cause any potential liquidity issues. in 2003, the value at risk model used historical simulations to estimate hypothetical movements in future market prices, assuming normal market conditions and historical market prices. in applying both value-at-risk methodologies, we do not consider that changing the portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one-day holding period to execute. while a one-day holding period has historically been the industry standard, a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints. we segregate our derivative contracts into trading and non-trading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. we calculate value at risk separately for these two categories. derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales under sfas 133 and non-derivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk. trading our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into to provide price risk management services to third-party customers. only contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are carried at fair value on the balance sheet. our value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was $1 million at december 31, 2004 and $5 million at december 31, 2003. during the year ended december 31, 2004, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $3 million to a low of $1 million. non-trading our non-trading portfolio consists of contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the following activities: segment commodity price risk exposure exploration production natural gas sales midstream natural gas purchases power natural gas purchases electricity purchases electricity sales the value at risk for contracts held for non-trading purposes was $29 million and $18 million at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2004, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $29 million to a low of $18 million. certain of the contracts held for non-trading purposes were accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas 133. we did not consider the underlying commodity positions to which the cash flow hedges relate in our value-at-risk model. therefore, value at risk does not represent economic losses that could occur on a total non-trading portfolio that includes the underlying commodity positions. foreign currency risk we have international investments that could affect our financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions in foreign countries. 86 table of contents international investments accounted for under the cost method totaled $52 million and $95 million at december 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively. these investments are primarily in non-publicly traded companies for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value. we believe that we can realize the carrying value of these investments considering the status of the operations of the companies underlying these investments. if a 20 percent change occurred in the value of the underlying currencies of these investments against the u.s. dollar, the fair value at december 31, 2004, could change by approximately $10 million assuming a direct correlation between the currency fluctuation and the value of the investments. the sale of our canadian straddle plants in july 2004 decreased our exposure to foreign currency risk. net assets of consolidated foreign operations whose functional currency is the local currency are located primarily in canada and approximate six percent of our net assets at december 31, 2004, compared to 15 percent of our net assets at december 31, 2003. these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in other currencies. however, these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position, due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of re-measuring the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the respective functional currencies against the u.s. dollar could have changed stockholders equity by approximately $64 million at december 31, 2004. we historically have not utilized derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge the risk associated with the movement in foreign currencies with the exception of a canadian dollar-denominated note receivable which was terminated in 2004 (see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements). however, we monitor currency fluctuations and could potentially use derivative financial instruments or employ other investment alternatives if cash flows or investment returns so warrant. 87 table of contents management report on internal control over financial reporting williams management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the securities exchange act of 1934) and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and board of directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. all internal control systems, no matter how well designed have inherent limitations. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. our management assessed the effectiveness of williams internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso) in internal control integrated framework. management assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. based on our assessment we believe that, as of december 31, 2004, williams internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. ernst young, llp, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our assessment of the company internal control over financial reporting. a copy of this report is included in this annual report on form 10-k. 88 table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting the board of directors and stockholders of the williams companies, inc. we have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying management report on internal control over financial reporting, that the williams companies, inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (the coso criteria). the williams companies, inc. management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. a company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. in our opinion, management assessment that the williams companies, inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the coso criteria. also, in our opinion, the williams companies, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004, based on the coso criteria. we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated balance sheet of the williams companies, inc. as of december 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2004 of the williams companies, inc. and our report dated march 8, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. tulsa, oklahoma march 8, 2005 89 table of contentsforward looking statements/ risk factors and cautionary

forward-looking statements statements that discuss our expected future results based on current and pending business operations. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report which address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, might, planned, potential, projects, scheduled or similar expressions. these forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding: amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; business strategy; estimates of proved gas and oil reserves; reserve potential; development drilling potential; cash flow from operations; seasonality of certain business segments; power and gas prices and demand. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this document. some of these risks are described in the risk factors section of this report and one should keep in mind these risk factors when considering forward-looking statements. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligation to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. further, the information about our intentions contained or incorporated into this report represents our intention as of the date of this report and is based on, among other things, the existing regulatory environment, industry conditions, market conditions and prices, the economy in general and our assumptions as of such date. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon any changes in such factors, in our assumptions, or otherwise. 21 table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. risks inherent to our industry and business the long-term financial condition of our natural gas transmission and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets, and market demand for natural gas. the development of additional natural gas reserves requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production, gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems. low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development of additional reserves and production, gathering, storage and pipeline transmission and import and export of natural gas supplies. additional natural gas reserves might not be developed in commercial quantities and in sufficient amounts to fill the capacities of our gathering, transmission and processing pipeline facilities. additionally, in some cases, new lng import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transmission facilities. estimating reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties and negative revisions to reserve estimates, and oil and gas price declines may lead to impairment of oil and gas assets. reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. reserves that are proved reserves are those estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects. the process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. the reserve data included in this report represent estimates. in addition, the estimates of future net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be correct over time. quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment. lower oil and gas prices may have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve estimates. if negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. the revisions may also be sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties which would result in a further non-cash charge to earnings. the revisions could also possibly affect the evaluation of exploration production goodwill for impairment purposes. 22 table of contents historic performance of our exploration and production business is no guarantee of future performance. our success rate for drilling projects in 2005 should not be considered a predictor of future performance. performance of our exploration and production business is affected in part by factors beyond our control, such as: regulations and regulatory approvals; availability of capital for drilling projects which may be affected by other risk factors discussed in this report; cost-effective availability of drilling rigs and necessary equipment; availability of cost-effective transportation for products; market risks discussed in this report. our drilling, production, gathering, processing and transporting activities involve numerous risks that might result in accidents and other operating risks and costs. our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards typically associated with the development and exploration for, and the production and transportation of oil and gas. these operating risks include, but are not limited to: blowouts, cratering and explosions; uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids; fires; formations with abnormal pressures; pollution and other environmental risks; natural disasters. in addition, there are inherent in our gas gathering, processing and transporting properties a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses. in addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. the location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. certain segments of our pipelines run through such areas. in spite of our precautions, an event could cause considerable harm to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers. such circumstances could adversely impact our ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers. costs of environmental liabilities and complying with existing and future environmental regulations could exceed our current expectations. our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial, state and municipal laws and regulations. such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment, and in connection with the operation, maintenance, abandonment and reclamation of our facilities. 23 table of contents compliance with environmental laws will require significant expenditures, including for clean up costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. the possible failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations that might result in the imposition of fines and penalties. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. although we do not expect that the costs of complying with current environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, no assurance can be given that the costs of complying with environmental laws in the future will not have such an effect. we make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. if the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions may change. our regulatory rate structure and our contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new environmental regulations. also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for certain development projects. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our operations. our operating results for certain segments of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. revenues from certain segments of our business, including gas transmission and the sale of electric power, can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. in other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. in addition, demand for gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our power sale agreements and gas transmission arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. additionally, changes in the price of natural gas could benefit one of our business units, but disadvantage another. for example, our exploration production business may benefit from higher natural gas prices, and power, which uses gas as a fuel source, may not. risks related to the current geopolitical situation our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to laws of other countries, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects. we currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries where we have interests or in which we might explore development, acquisition or investment opportunities present risks of delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain non-recourse project or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments. 24 table of contents operations in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. in certain conditions under which we develop or acquire projects, or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. in addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency but receive revenue in another. in such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. foreign currency risk can also arise when the revenues received by our foreign subsidiaries are not in u.s. dollars. in such cases, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar could reduce the amount of cash and income we receive from these foreign subsidiaries. we have put contracts in place to mitigate our most significant foreign currency exchange risks. we have some exposures that are not hedged which could result in losses or volatility in our earnings. risks related to strategy and financing our debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict or limit among other things, our ability to create liens, sell assets, make certain distributions, repurchase equity and incur additional debt. in addition, our debt agreements contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by many events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that our future operating results will be sufficient to comply with the covenants or, in the event of a default under any of our debt agreements, to remedy that default. our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements and other related transactional documents could result in events of default. upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. an event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt agreement. such a default or acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. if an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under such debt agreements. developments affecting the wholesale power and energy trading industry sector have reduced market activity and liquidity and might continue to adversely affect our results of operations. in 2004, we announced our decision to maintain our wholesale power and energy trading business and trading portfolio. therefore, the legacy issues arising out of the 2000-2001 energy crisis in california, the resulting collapse in energy merchant credit and volatility in natural gas prices, the enron corporation bankruptcy filing, and investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading activities and increased litigation related to such inquiries, could continue to affect us in the future. these market factors have led to industry-wide downturns that have resulted in some companies being forced to exit the energy trading markets leading to a reduction in the number of trading partners and market liquidity. our lack of investment grade credit ratings increases our costs of doing business in many ways and increases our risks from market disruptions and further credit downgrades. because we do not have an investment grade credit rating, our transactions in each of our businesses require greater credit assurances, both to be given from, and received by, us to satisfy credit support requirements. in addition, we are more vulnerable to the impact of market disruptions or a further downgrade 25 table of contents of our credit rating that might further increase our cost of borrowing or further impair our ability to access one or any of the capital markets. such disruptions could include: further economic downturns; deteriorating capital market conditions generally; declining market prices for electricity and natural gas; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies; the overall health of the energy industry, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies. despite our restructuring efforts, we may not attain investment grade ratings. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. given the significant changes in capital markets and the energy industry over the last few years, credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for attaining investment grade ratings and make changes to those criteria from time to time. our goal is to attain investment grade ratios. however, there is no guarantee that the credit rating agencies will assign us investment grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their criteria for investment grade ratios. electricity, natural gas liquids and gas prices are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth and the value of our power and gas businesses depend primarily upon the prices we receive for natural gas, electricity and other commodities. prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for electricity, natural gas, petroleum, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels; the availability of pipeline capacity; the price and level of foreign imports; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; volatility in the natural gas markets; the overall economic environment; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold. we might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets. our portfolios consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including contracts for electricity, natural gas, natural gas liquids and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the 26 table of contents commodity or cash throughout the united states. if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage, we could realize material losses from our marketing. in the past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. in certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. in such event, we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. in addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our counterparties. despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. if the counterparty to such a financing transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty obligation is inadequate, we will lose money. if we are unable to perform under our energy agreements, we could be required to pay damages. these damages generally would be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement energy or energy services and the relevant contract price. depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be significant. risks related to regulations that affect our industry our gas sales, transmission, and storage operations are subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that could have an adverse impact on the profitability of these operations. our interstate gas sales, transmission, and storage operations conducted through our gas pipelines business are subject to the ferc rules and regulations in accordance with the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978. the ferc regulatory authority extends to: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates and charges; construction; acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; operating terms and conditions of service. regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our business. the ferc has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased competition throughout the industry. in a number of key markets, interstate pipelines are now facing competitive pressure from other major pipeline systems, enabling local distribution companies and end users to choose a transmission provider based on considerations other than location. our revenues might decrease if we are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission and distribution assets due to the ferc and regional regulation of wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas. we depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we buy and sell in the wholesale market. if transmission is disrupted, if capacity is inadequate, or if credit requirements or rates of such utilities or energy companies are increased, our ability to sell and deliver products might be hindered. the ferc has issued power transmission regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, we believe that some companies may have failed to provide fair and equal access to 27 table of contents their transmission systems or have not provided sufficient transmission capacity to enable other companies to transmit electric power. we cannot predict whether and to what extent the industry will comply with these initiatives, or whether the regulations will fully accomplish the ferc objectives. in addition, the independent system operators who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets, such as california, have in the past been authorized to impose, and might continue to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. these types of price limitations and other mechanisms might adversely impact the profitability of our wholesale power marketing and trading. given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price history in many of these markets and the imposition of price limitations by regulators, independent system operators or other marker operators, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets. the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing regulatory structures, which could affect our growth and performance in these regions. our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission regulatory structures in various regional power markets. problems or delays that might arise in the formation and operation of new regional transmission organizations (rtos) might restrict our ability to sell power produced by our generating capacity to certain markets if there is insufficient transmission capacity otherwise available. the rules governing the various regional power markets might also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues. because it remains unclear which companies will be participating in the various regional power markets, or how rtos will develop and evolve or what regions they will cover, we are unable to assess fully the impact that these power markets might have on our business. our businesses are subject to complex government regulations. the operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation. existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, and future changes in laws and regulations might have a detrimental effect on our business. over the past few years, certain restructured energy markets have experienced supply problems and price volatility. in some of these markets, including california, proposals have been made by governmental agencies and other interested parties to re-regulate areas of these markets which have previously been deregulated. various forms of market controls and limitations including price caps and bid caps have already been implemented and new controls and market restructuring proposals are in various stages of development, consideration and implementation. we cannot assure you that changes in market structure and regulation will not adversely affect our business. we cannot assure you that other proposals to re-regulate will not be made or that legislative or other attention to the electric power restructuring process will not cause the deregulation process to be delayed or reversed. the outcome of pending rate cases to set the rates we can charge customers on certain of our pipelines might result in rates that do not provide an adequate return on the capital we have invested in those pipelines. we anticipate that in the next twelve months we will file rate cases with the ferc to request changes to the rates we charge on northwest pipeline and transco. the outcome of those rate cases is uncertain. there is a risk that rates set by the ferc will be lower than is necessary to provide us with an adequate return on the capital we have invested in these assets. there is also the risk that higher rates will cause our customers to look for alternative ways to transport their natural gas. legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry and capital markets have adversely affected our business and many continue to do so. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being either proposed or implemented. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in which we are a named defendant. 28 table of contents such inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing and continue to adversely affect our business as a whole. we might see these adverse effects continue as a result of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters against us arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including environmental matters, disputes over gas measurement, royalty payments, shareholder class action suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. risks related to accounting standards potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosure in the future, which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance. accounting irregularities discovered in the past few years in various industries have forced regulators and legislators to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial disclosures, companies relationships with their independent auditors and retirement plan practices. because it is still unclear what laws or regulations will ultimately develop, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies or the energy industry or in our operations specifically. in addition, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) or the sec could enact new accounting standards that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. risks related to market volatility and risk management our reported results are subject to volatility around our use of derivatives that hedge the economic risk of our commodity exposures. some derivatives do not qualify as hedges under sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, (sfas 133) and so changes in fair value are recorded to income. during the period from 2002 to 2004 when our power business was for sale, most changes in the fair value of derivatives used in our power business were recorded to income as net forward unrealized mark-to -market gains. in future periods, the cash associated with those hedges could be realized but the value will have already been recorded in income. our risk measurement and hedging activities might not prevent losses. we manage our commodity price risk for our unregulated businesses as a whole. although we have risk measurement systems in place that use various methodologies to quantify risk, these systems might not always be followed or might not always work as planned. further, such risk measurement systems do not in themselves manage risk, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, and changes in interest rates might still adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and our balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations, including our long-term tolling agreements. in these hedging activities, we have used fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the -counter markets or on exchanges, as well as long-term structured transactions when feasible. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the tolling contract counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be 29 table of contents able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows could be impacted by counterparty default. the impact of changes in market prices for natural gas on the average gas prices received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging strategies. these hedging arrangements may limit our potential gains if the market prices for natural gas were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. in addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: production is less than expected; a change in the difference between published price indexes established by pipelines in which our hedged production is delivered and the reference price established in the hedging arrangements is such that we are required to make payments to our counterparties; the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments. risks related to employees, outsourcing of non-core support activities institutional knowledge residing with current employees or our former employees now employed by our outsourcing service providers might not be adequately preserved. in certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. as these employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. other qualified individuals could leave us or refuse our offers of employment if our recruiting and retention efforts are unsuccessful. our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. due to the large number of our former employees who were migrated to an outsourcing provider in 2004, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us, particularly if knowledge transfer initiatives are delayed or ineffective. failure of the outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing relationships. although we have taken steps to build a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our outsourcing providers, a failure of all or part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be able to conduct our business. our ability to receive services from outsourcing provider locations outside of the united states might be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, or unanticipated regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the united states. certain accounting, information technology application development, human resources, and helpdesk services that are currently provided by our outsourcing provider were relocated to service centers outside of the united states during 2005. the economic and political conditions in certain countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide services to us present similar risks of business operations located outside of the united states previously discussed, including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. risks related to weather, other natural phenomena and business disruption our assets and operations can be affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, can be adversely affected by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. 30 table of contents our current information technology infrastructure is aging and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. limited capital spending for information technology infrastructure during 2001-2003 resulted in an aging server environment that may not be adequate for our current business needs. while efforts are ongoing to update the environment, the current age and condition of equipment could result in loss of internal and external communications, loss of data, inability to access data when needed, excessive software downtime (including downtime for critical software applications), and other disruptions that could have a material adverse impact on our business. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 77 qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. the majority of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected life of our operating assets. the tables below provide information about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2005 and 2004. long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. fair value december 31, 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 thereafter (1) total 2005 (dollars in millions)

and premium. (2) the weighted-average interest rate for 2005 is libor plus 2 percent. (3) the weighted-average interest rate for 2004 was libor plus 2.1 percent. (4) excludes capital leases. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, electricity, refined products and natural gas liquids, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and commodity price correlations, including correlations between crude oil and gas prices and between natural gas and power prices. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts and our proprietary trading activities. we manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations using various derivatives and non-derivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to changes in energy-commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. we measure the risk in our portfolios using a value-at-risk methodology to estimate the potential one-day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios. value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolios. our value-at-risk model uses a monte carlo method to 77 table of contents simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent probability that the one-day loss in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at risk. the simulation method uses historical correlations and market forward prices and volatilities. in applying the value-at-risk methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical movements affect the positions or would cause any potential liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one-day holding period to execute. while a one-day holding period has historically been the industry standard, a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints. we segregate our derivative contracts into trading and nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. we calculate value at risk separately for these two categories. derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales under sfas 133 and nonderivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk. trading our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity price-risk exposure. only contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are carried at fair value on the balance sheet. our value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was approximately $4 million at december 31, 2005, and $1 million at december 31, 2004. during the year ended december 31, 2005, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $6 million to a low of $1 million. nontrading our nontrading portfolio consists of contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the following activities: segment commodity price risk exposure exploration production natural gas sales midstream natural gas purchases power natural gas purchases and sales electricity purchases and sales the value at risk for contracts held for nontrading purposes was $17 million at december 31, 2005, and $29 million at december 31, 2004. during the year ended december 31, 2005, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $34 million to a low of $17 million. certain of the contracts held for nontrading purposes are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas 133. we do not consider the underlying commodity positions to which the cash flow hedges relate in our value-at-risk model. therefore, value at risk does not represent economic losses that could occur on a total nontrading portfolio that includes the underlying commodity positions. foreign currency risk we have international investments that could affect our financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or the economic conditions in foreign countries. international investments accounted for under the cost method totaled $45 million and $52 million at december 31, 2005, and 2004, respectively. these investments are primarily in nonpublicly traded companies for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value. we believe that we can realize the carrying value of these investments considering the status of the operations of the companies underlying these investments. if a 20 percent change occurred in the value of the underlying currencies of these investments against the u.s. dollar, the fair value at december 31, 2005, could change by approximately $9.1 million assuming a direct correlation between the currency fluctuation and the value of the investments. 78 table of contents net assets of consolidated foreign operations whose functional currency is the local currency are located primarily in canada and approximate six percent of our net assets at december 31, 2005, and 2004. these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in other currencies. however, these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position, due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of re-measuring the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the respective functional currencies against the u.s. dollar could have changed stockholders equity by approximately $62 million at december 31, 2005. 79 table of contentsforward looking statements/risk factors and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 20 risk factors 21 risk factors forward-looking statements/risk factors and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 certain matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these statements discuss our expected future results based on current and pending business operations. we make those forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report which address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, might, planned, potential, projects, scheduled or similar expressions. these forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding: amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; business strategy; 20 table of contents estimates of proved gas and oil reserves; reserve potential; development drilling potential; cash flow from operations; seasonality of certain business segments; power, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and demand. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this document. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or project. specific factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include: availability of supplies (including the uncertainties inherent in assessing and estimating future natural gas reserves), market demand, volatility of prices, and increased costs of capital; inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and general economic conditions; the strength and financial resources of our competitors; development of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and development hazards; costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations including proposed climate change legislation, environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings; changes in the current geopolitical situation; risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements and our lack of investment grade credit ratings; risk associated with future weather conditions and acts of terrorism. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in additions to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors include the following: risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. 21 table of contents risks inherent to our industry and business the long-term financial condition of our natural gas transmission and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets, and market demand for natural gas. the development of the additional natural gas reserves that are essential for our gas transmission and midstream businesses to thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production, gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems. low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development and production of additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline transmission and import and export of natural gas supplies, adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our gathering, transmission and processing facilities. additionally, in some cases, new lng import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transmission facilities. estimating reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties. negative revisions to reserve estimates and oil and gas price declines may lead to decreased earnings, losses or impairment of oil and gas assets. reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. reserves that are proved reserves are those estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects. the process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. the reserve data included in this report represent estimates. in addition, the estimates of future net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be correct over time. quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment. lower oil and gas prices may have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve estimates. if negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. the revisions may also be sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties which would result in a further non-cash charge to earnings. the revisions could also possibly affect the evaluation of exploration production goodwill for impairment purposes. our past success rate for drilling projects and the historic performance of our exploration and production business is no predictor of future performance. our past success rate for drilling projects in 2006 should not be considered a predictor of future performance. performance of our exploration and production business is affected in part by factors beyond our control (any of which could cause the results of this business to decrease materially), such as: regulations and regulatory approvals; availability of capital for drilling projects which may be affected by other risk factors discussed in this report; cost-effective availability of drilling rigs and necessary equipment; 22 table of contents availability of skilled labor; availability of cost-effective transportation for products; market risks (including price risks and competition) discussed in this report. our drilling, production, gathering, processing and transporting activities involve numerous risks that might result in accidents, and other operating risks and hazards. our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards typically associated with the development and exploration for, and the production and transportation of oil and gas. these operating risks include, but are not limited to: blowouts, cratering and explosions; uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids; fires; formations with abnormal pressures; pollution and other environmental risks; natural disasters. in addition, there are inherent in our gas gathering, processing and transporting properties a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, spills, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses. in addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the location of certain segments of our pipelines in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. in spite of our precautions, an event could cause considerable harm to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers. such circumstances could materially impact our ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers, with a resulting impact on our results of operations. costs of environmental liabilities and complying with existing and future environmental regulations could exceed our current expectations. our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial, state and municipal laws and regulations. such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, extraction, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment, and in connection with the operation, maintenance, abandonment and reclamation of our facilities. compliance with environmental laws requires significant expenditures, including for clean up costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. in addition, the possible failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations might result in the imposition of fines and penalties. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. although we do not expect that the costs of complying with current environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on 23 table of contents our financial condition or results of operations, no assurance can be given that the costs of complying with environmental laws in the future will not have such an effect. we make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. if the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions may change. our regulatory rate structure and our contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new environmental regulations. also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for certain development projects. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our results of operations. our operating results for certain segments of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. revenues from certain segments of our business, including gas transmission and the sale of electric power, can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. in other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. in addition, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our power sale agreements and natural gas transmission arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. additionally, changes in the price of natural gas could benefit one of our business units, but disadvantage another. for example, our exploration production business may benefit from higher natural gas prices, and power, which uses gas as a fuel source, may not. risks related to the current geopolitical situation our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects. we currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries where we have interests or in which we might explore development, acquisition or investment opportunities present risks of delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain non-recourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments. recent events in certain south american countries, particularly the proposed nationalization of certain energy-related assets in venezuela, could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. we may not receive adequate compensation, or any compensation, if our assets in venezuela are nationalized. operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. in certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to u.s. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. in addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. in such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. foreign currency risk can also arise when the revenues received by our foreign subsidiaries are not in u.s. dollars. in such cases, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar or a weakening of the foreign currency could reduce the amount of 24 table of contents cash and income we receive from these foreign subsidiaries. we have put contracts in place designed to mitigate our most significant foreign currency exchange risks. we have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations. risks related to strategy and financing our debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict or limit among other things, our ability to create liens, sell assets, make certain distributions, repurchase equity and incur additional debt. in addition, our debt agreements contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by many events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that our future operating results will be sufficient to comply with the covenants or, in the event of a default under any of our debt agreements, to remedy that default. our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements and other related transactional documents could result in events of default. upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. an event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt agreement. such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. if an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under such debt agreements. our lack of investment grade credit ratings increases our costs of doing business in certain ways and attainment of an investment grade rating is within the control of independent third parties. because we do not have an investment grade credit rating, our transactions in each of our businesses require greater credit assurances, both to be given from, and received by, us to satisfy credit support requirements. in addition, we are more vulnerable to the impact of market disruptions or a further downgrade of our credit rating that might further increase our cost of borrowing or further impair our ability to access capital markets. such disruptions could include: economic downturns; deteriorating capital market conditions generally; declining market prices for electricity and natural gas; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies; the overall health of the energy industry, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. given the significant changes in capital markets and the energy industry over the last few years, credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for attaining investment grade ratings and make changes to those criteria from time to time. our goal is to attain investment grade ratios. however, there is no guarantee that the credit rating agencies will assign us investment grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their criteria for investment grade ratios. long-term power generation purchase contracts without corresponding long-term purchase sale contracts might expose us to fluctuations in the wholesale power markets and negatively affect our results of operations. we have entered into agreements with certain power generation facilities to purchase all or a substantial portion of their generation capacity. these facilities operate as merchant facilities, many without corresponding long-term power sales agreements, and therefore are exposed to market fluctuations. without the benefit of such 25 table of contents long-term power sales agreements, we cannot be sure that we will be able to sell any or all of the power generated by these facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these power generation relationships will be profitable. we sell all or a portion of the energy, capacity and other products from certain generation facilities to wholesale power markets, including energy markets operated by independent system operators, or isos, or regional transmission organizations, or rtos, as well as wholesale purchasers. we are not subject to traditional cost-based regulation, therefore we sell electric generation capacity, power and ancillary services to wholesale purchasers at prices determined by the market. as a result, we are not guaranteed any rate of return on our capital investments through mandated rates, and our revenues and results of operations depend upon current and forward market prices for power. prices for electricity, natural gas liquids, natural gas and other commodities are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of our power and gas businesses depend primarily upon the prices we receive for electricity, natural gas liquids, natural gas, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities. prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. in particular, market prices for power, generation capacity and ancillary services tend to fluctuate substantially. unlike other commodities, electricity can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be produced concurrently with its use. as a result, market prices for electricity are subject to significant volatility from supply and demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and spot markets. the markets for electricity, natural gas liquids, and natural gas are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for electricity, natural gas, petroleum, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; the development of federal and state power markets, including actions of isos and rtos; the price and availability of other types of fuels; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transmission disruptions; the price and level of foreign imports; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; volatility in the natural gas markets; the overall economic environment; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold. we might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets. our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts consists of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including contracts for electricity, natural gas, natural gas liquids and other commodities that are 26 table of contents settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash throughout the united states. if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage, it could negatively affect our results of operations. in the past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. in certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. if such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our contracts, we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. in addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our counterparties. despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. if the counterparty to such a financing transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty obligation is inadequate, we will suffer a loss. if we are unable to perform under our energy agreements, we could be required to pay damages. these damages generally would be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement energy or energy services and the relevant contract price. depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be significant. risks related to regulations that affect our industry our natural gas sales, transmission, and storage operations are subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. our interstate natural gas sales, transmission, and storage operations conducted through our gas pipelines business are subject to the ferc rules and regulations in accordance with the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978. the ferc regulatory authority extends to: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates and charges; construction; acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; operating terms and conditions of service. regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our business. the ferc has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased competition throughout the industry. in a number of key markets, interstate pipelines are now facing competitive pressure from other major pipeline systems, enabling local distribution companies and end users to choose a transmission provider based on considerations other than location. competition in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our results of operations. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. other companies with which we compete may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. 27 table of contents expiration of firm transportation agreements. a substantial portion of the operating revenues of our gas pipelines are generated through firm transportation agreements that expire periodically and must be renegotiated and extended or replaced. we cannot give any assurance as to whether any of these agreements will be extended or replaced or that the terms of any renegotiated agreements will be as favorable as the existing agreements. upon the expiration of these agreements, should customers turn back or substantially reduce their commitments, we could experience a negative effect to our results of operations. our revenues might decrease if we are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission and distribution assets due to regulation by the ferc and regional authorities of wholesale market transactions for electricity and natural gas. we depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we buy and sell in the wholesale market. if transmission is disrupted, if capacity is inadequate, or if credit requirements or rates of such utilities or energy companies are increased, our ability to sell and deliver products might be hindered. the ferc has issued power transmission regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, some companies may fail to provide fair and equal access to their transmission systems or may not provide sufficient transmission capacity to enable other companies to transmit electric power. in addition, the independent system operators who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets, such as california, have in the past been authorized to impose, and might continue to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. these types of price limitations and other mechanisms might adversely impact the profitability of our wholesale power marketing and trading. given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price history in many of these markets and the imposition of price limitations by regulators, isos, rtos or other marker operators, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets or that our results of operations will not be adversely affected by the actions of these parties. our businesses are subject to complex government regulations. the operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation. existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, and future changes in laws and regulations might have a detrimental effect on our business. over the past few years, certain restructured energy markets have experienced supply problems and price volatility. in some of these markets, proposals have been made by governmental agencies and other interested parties to re-regulate areas of these markets which have previously been deregulated. various forms of market controls and limitations including price caps and bid caps have already been implemented and new controls and market restructuring proposals are in various stages of development, consideration and implementation. we cannot assure you that changes in market structure and regulation will not adversely affect our business and results of operations. we also cannot assure you that other proposals to re-regulate will not be made or that legislative or other attention to these restructured energy markets will not cause the deregulation process to be delayed or reversed or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. the outcome of pending rate cases to set the rates we can charge customers on certain of our pipelines might result in rates that do not provide an adequate return on the capital we have invested in those pipelines. we have filed rate cases with the ferc to request changes to the rates we charge on northwest pipeline and transco. although we have a pending settlement of our northwest pipeline rate case, we must still obtain approval of the settlement. therefore, the outcome of both rate cases remains uncertain. there is a risk that rates set by the ferc will be lower than is necessary to provide us with an adequate return on the capital we have invested in these 28 table of contents assets. there is also the risk that higher rates will cause our customers to look for alternative ways to transport their natural gas. legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry and capital markets have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being either proposed or implemented. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in which we are a named defendant. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing and continue to adversely affect our business as a whole. we might see these adverse effects continue as a result of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters against us arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including environmental matters, disputes over gas measurement, royalty payments, shareholder class action suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. risks related to accounting standards potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosures in the future, which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance. accounting irregularities discovered in the past few years across various industries have forced regulators and legislators to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial disclosures, companies relationships with their independent registered public accounting firms and retirement plan practices. we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies or the energy industry or in our operations specifically. in addition, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) or the sec could enact new accounting standards that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. risks related to market volatility and risk measurement and hedging activities our risk measurement and hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. we manage our commodity price risk for our unregulated businesses as a whole. although we have systems in place that use various methodologies to quantify risk, these systems might not always be followed or might not always be effective. further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations, including our long-term tolling agreements. in these hedging activities, we have used fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges, as well as long-term structured transactions when feasible. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective 29 table of contents in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the tolling contract counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results and could also result in reported cash flows in future years not reflecting the realization of increases in the fair value of derivatives that have already been reflected in our income statements. changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, (sfas 133) to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as hedges under sfas 133, must be recorded in our income. this creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to the company has occurred during the applicable period. during the period from 2002 to 2004 when our power business was for sale, most changes in the fair value of derivatives used in our power business were reflected in our earnings as net forward unrealized mark-to-market gains. as a result, in future periods if the cash benefits associated with those hedges are actually realized, the value will not be reflected as earnings on our income statement, having already been recorded as earnings in prior years. the impact of changes in market prices for natural gas on the average gas prices received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging strategies. these hedging arrangements may limit our potential gains if the market prices for natural gas were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. in addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: production is less than expected; a change in the difference between published price indexes established by pipelines in which our hedged production is delivered and the reference price established in the hedging arrangements is such that we are required to make payments to our counterparties; the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments. risks related to employees, outsourcing of non-core support activities, and technology institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility might not be adequately preserved. in certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. as these employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. failure of the outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing relationships. although we have taken steps to build a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our outsourcing providers and to closely monitor their performance, a deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be able to conduct our business. 30 table of contents our ability to receive services from outsourcing provider locations outside of the united states might be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, or unanticipated regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the united states. certain of our accounting, information technology, application development, and helpdesk services are currently provided by an outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide services to us present similar risks of business operations located outside of the united states previously discussed, including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. our current information technology infrastructure is aging and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. limited capital spending for information technology infrastructure during 2001-2003 resulted in an aging server environment that may be less efficient, may require more personnel and capital resources to maintain and upgrade than more current systems, and may not be adequate for our current business needs. while efforts are ongoing to update the environment, the current age and condition of equipment could result in loss of internal and external communications, loss of data, inability to access data when needed, excessive software downtime (including downtime for critical software applications), and other disruptions that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. risks related to weather, other natural phenomena and business disruption our assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can be adversely affected by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to generate, produce, process, transmit, transport or distribute electricity, natural gas or natural gas liquids. acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 76 qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. the majority of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. the tables below provide information about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2006 and 2005. long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings.

(4) excludes capital leases. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of natural gas, electricity, and natural gas liquids, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and commodity price correlations, including correlations between natural gas and power prices. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts and our proprietary trading activities. we manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to changes in energy-commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. we measure the risk in our portfolios using a value-at-risk methodology to estimate the potential one-day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios. value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolios. our value-at-risk model uses a monte carlo method to simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent probability that the one-day loss in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at risk. the simulation method uses historical correlations and market forward prices and volatilities. in applying the value-at-risk methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical movements affect the positions 76 table of contents or would cause any potential liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one-day holding period to execute. while a one-day holding period has historically been the industry standard, a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints. we segregate our derivative contracts into trading and nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. we calculate value at risk separately for these two categories. derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales under sfas 133 and nonderivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk. trading our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity price-risk exposure. our value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was approximately $1 million at december 31, 2006, and $4 million at december 31, 2005. during the year ended december 31, 2006, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $4 million to a low of $1 million. nontrading our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the following activities: segment commodity price risk exposure exploration production natural gas sales midstream natural gas purchases power natural gas purchases and sales electricity purchases and sales the value at risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes was $12 million at december 31, 2006, and $28 million at december 31, 2005. during the year ended december 31, 2006, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $25 million to a low of $12 million. certain of the derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas 133. though these contracts are included in our value-at-risk calculation, any change in the fair value of these hedge contracts would generally not be reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item affects earnings. foreign currency risk we have international investments that could affect our financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or the economic conditions in foreign countries. international investments accounted for under the cost method totaled $42 million at december 31, 2006, and $45 million at december 31, 2005. these investments are primarily in nonpublicly traded companies for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value. we believe that we can realize the carrying value of these investments considering the status of the operations of the companies underlying these investments. if a 20 percent change occurred in the value of the underlying currencies of these investments against the u.s. dollar, the fair value at december 31, 2006, could change by approximately $8.3 million assuming a direct correlation between the currency fluctuation and the value of the investments. net assets of consolidated foreign operations whose functional currency is the local currency are located primarily in canada and approximate 6 percent of our net assets at december 31, 2006 and 2005. these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in other currencies. however, these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position, due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of re-measuring the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the respective functional currencies against the u.s. dollar could have changed stockholders equity by approximately $68 million at december 31, 2006. 77 table of contentsforward looking statements/risk factors and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 19 risk factors 21 risk factors forward-looking statements/risk factors and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 certain matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these statements discuss our expected future results based on current and pending business operations. we make those forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. 19 table of contents all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report which address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, might, planned, potential, projects, scheduled or similar expressions. these forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding: amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; business strategy; estimates of proved gas and oil reserves; reserve potential; development drilling potential; cash flow from operations or results of operations; seasonality of certain business segments; natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and demand. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this document. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or project. specific factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include: availability of supplies (including the uncertainties inherent in assessing and estimating future natural gas reserves), market demand, volatility of prices, and increased costs of capital; inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and general economic conditions; the strength and financial resources of our competitors; development of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and development hazards; costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations including proposed climate change legislation, environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings; changes in the current geopolitical situation; risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements and future changes in our credit ratings; risks associated with future weather conditions; acts of terrorism. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. 20 table of contents because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors include the following: risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. risks inherent to our industry and business the long-term financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets, and market demand for natural gas. the development of the additional natural gas reserves that are essential for our gas transportation and midstream businesses to thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production, gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems. low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development and production of additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline transportation and import and export of natural gas supplies, adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our gathering, transportation and processing facilities. additionally, in some cases, new lng import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transportation facilities. estimating reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties. negative revisions to reserve estimates and oil and gas price declines may lead to decreased earnings, losses or impairment of oil and gas assets, including related goodwill. reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. reserves that are proved reserves are those estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects. the process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. the reserve data included in this report represent estimates. in addition, the estimates of future net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be correct over time. quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment. changes to oil and gas prices in the markets for such commodities may have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve estimates. if negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. the revisions may also be sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties which would result in a further non-cash charge to earnings. the revisions could also possibly affect the evaluation of exploration production goodwill for impairment purposes. 21 table of contents our past success rate for drilling projects and the historic performance of our exploration and production business is no predictor of future performance. our past success rate for drilling projects in 2007 should not be considered a predictor of future performance. performance of our exploration and production business is affected in part by factors beyond our control (any of which could cause the results of this business to decrease materially), such as: regulations and regulatory approvals; availability of capital for drilling projects which may be affected by other risk factors discussed in this report; cost-effective availability of drilling rigs and necessary equipment; availability of skilled labor; availability of cost-effective transportation for products; market risks (including price risks and competition) discussed in this report. our drilling, production, gathering, processing and transporting activities involve numerous risks that might result in accidents, and other operating risks and hazards. our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards typically associated with the development and exploration for, and the production and transportation of oil and gas. these operating risks include, but are not limited to: blowouts, cratering and explosions; uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids; fires; formations with abnormal pressures; pollution and other environmental risks; natural disasters. in addition, there are inherent in our gas gathering, processing and transporting properties a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, spills, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses. in addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the location of certain segments of our pipelines in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. in spite of our precautions, an event could cause considerable harm to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers. such circumstances could materially impact our ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers, with a resulting impact on our results of operations. costs of environmental liabilities and complying with existing and future environmental regulations could exceed our current expectations. our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial, state and municipal laws and regulations. such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, extraction, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, in connection with spills, releases and emissions of 22 table of contents various substances into the environment, and in connection with the operation, maintenance, abandonment and reclamation of our facilities. compliance with environmental laws requires significant expenditures, including for clean up costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. in addition, the possible failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations might result in the imposition of fines and penalties. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. although we do not expect that the costs of complying with current environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, no assurance can be given that the costs of complying with environmental laws in the future will not have such an effect. changes in federal laws or regulations could reduce the availability or increase the cost of our interstate pipeline capacity or gas supply, and thereby reduce our earnings. congress and certain states have for some time been considering various forms of legislation related to greenhouse gas emissions. there is a possibility that, when and if enacted, the final form of such legislation could increase our costs of compliance with environmental laws. we make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. if the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions may change. our regulatory rate structure and our contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new environmental regulations. also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for certain development projects. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our results of operations. our operating results for certain segments of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. revenues from certain segments of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. additionally, changes in the price of natural gas could benefit one of our business units, but disadvantage another. for example, our exploration production business may benefit from higher natural gas prices, and midstream, which uses gas as a feedstock, may not. risks related to the current geopolitical situation our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects. we currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries where we have interests or in which we might explore development, acquisition or investment opportunities present risks of delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire 23 table of contents projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain non-recourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments. recent events in certain south american countries, particularly the continued threat of nationalization of certain energy-related assets in venezuela, could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. we may not receive adequate compensation, or any compensation, if our assets in venezuela are nationalized. operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. in certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to u.s. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. in addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. in such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. we may or may not put contracts in place designed to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. we have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations. risks related to strategy and financing our debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict or limit among other things, our ability to create liens, sell assets, make certain distributions, repurchase equity and incur additional debt. in addition, our debt agreements contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by many events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that our future operating results will be sufficient to comply with the covenants or, in the event of a default under any of our debt agreements, to remedy that default. our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements and other related transactional documents could result in events of default. upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. an event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt agreement. such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. if an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under such debt agreements. a downgrade of our current credit ratings could impact our costs of doing business in certain ways and maintaining current credit ratings is within the control of independent third parties. a downgrade of our credit rating might increase our cost of borrowing. our ability to access capital markets could also be limited by a downgrade of our credit rating and other disruptions. such disruptions could include: economic downturns; deteriorating capital market conditions generally; declining market prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids and other commodities; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies; the overall health of the energy industry, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. given the significant changes in capital markets and the energy industry over the last few years, credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for attaining investment grade ratings and make changes to those criteria from time to time. our corporate family credit rating and the credit ratings of transco and northwest pipeline were raised to investment 24 table of contents grade in 2007 by standard poor s, moody corporation, and fitch ratings, ltd., and our senior unsecured debt ratings were raised to investment grade by moody and fitch. no assurance can be given that the credit rating agencies will assign us investment grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their criteria for investment grade ratios or that our senior unsecured debt rating will be raised to investment grade by all of the credit rating agencies. prices for natural gas liquids, natural gas and other commodities are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of certain segments of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices we receive for natural gas liquids, natural gas, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities. prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. the markets for natural gas liquids, natural gas and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, natural gas liquids, petroleum, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and level of foreign imports; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; volatility in the natural gas markets; the overall economic environment; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold; the adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate change. we might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets. our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts consists of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including contracts for natural gas, natural gas liquids and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash throughout the united states. if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage, it could negatively affect our results of operations. in the past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. in certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. if such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our contracts, we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. in addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our counterparties. despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts 25 table of contents owed to us. if the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty obligation is inadequate, we will suffer a loss. if we are unable to perform under our energy agreements, we could be required to pay damages. these damages generally would be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement energy or energy services and the relevant contract price. depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be significant. risks related to regulations that affect our industry our natural gas sales, transmission, and storage operations are subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. our interstate natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations conducted through our gas pipelines business are subject to the ferc rules and regulations in accordance with the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978. the ferc regulatory authority extends to: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates and charges; construction; acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; operating terms and conditions of service. regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our business. regulatory decisions could also affect our costs for compression, processing and dehydration of natural gas, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations. the ferc has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased competition throughout the industry. in a number of key markets, interstate pipelines are now facing competitive pressure from other major pipeline systems, enabling local distribution companies and end users to choose a transportation provider based on considerations other than location. competition in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our results of operations. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. other companies with which we compete may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. expiration of firm transportation agreements. a substantial portion of the operating revenues of our gas pipelines are generated through firm transportation agreements that expire periodically and must be renegotiated and extended or replaced. we cannot give any assurance as to whether any of these agreements will be extended or replaced or that the terms of any renegotiated agreements will be as favorable as the existing agreements. upon the expiration of these agreements, should customers turn back or substantially reduce their commitments, we could experience a negative effect to our results of operations. 26 table of contents our revenues might decrease if we are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transportation and distribution assets. we depend on transportation and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the commodities we buy and sell in the wholesale market. if transportation is disrupted, if capacity is inadequate, or if credit requirements or rates of such utilities or energy companies are increased, our ability to sell and deliver products might be hindered. further, although there are laws and regulations designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions, some companies may fail to provide fair and equal access to their transportation systems or may not provide sufficient transportation capacity for other market participants. our businesses are subject to complex government regulations. the operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us, our facilities or our customers, and future changes in laws and regulations might have a detrimental effect on our business. over the past few years, certain restructured energy markets have experienced supply problems and price volatility. in some of these markets, proposals have been made by governmental agencies and other interested parties to re-regulate areas of these markets which have previously been deregulated. various forms of market controls and limitations including price caps and bid caps have already been implemented and new controls and market restructuring proposals are in various stages of development, consideration and implementation. we cannot assure you that changes in market structure and regulation will not adversely affect our business and results of operations. we also cannot assure you that other proposals to re-regulate will not be made or that legislative or other attention to these restructured energy markets will not cause the deregulation process to be delayed or reversed or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. the outcome of a pending rate case to set the rates we can charge customers on transco pipeline might result in rates that do not provide an adequate return on the capital we have invested in the transco pipeline. we have a pending rate case with the ferc to request changes to the rates we charge on transco. we have sought ferc approval of a settlement of the significant issues in the rate case but until ferc approves the settlement, the outcome of the rate case remains uncertain. there is a risk that rates set by the ferc will lower our return on the capital we have invested in our assets or might not be adequate to recover increases in operating costs. there is also the risk that higher rates will cause our customers to look for alternative ways to transport their natural gas. legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry and capital markets have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being either proposed or implemented. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in which we are a named defendant. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing and continue to adversely affect our business as a whole. we might see these adverse effects continue as a result of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters against us arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including environmental matters, disputes over gas measurement, royalty payments, shareholder class action suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions 27 table of contents against us. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. risks related to accounting standards potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosures in the future, which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance. regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial disclosures, companies relationships with their independent registered public accounting firms, and retirement plan practices. we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies or the energy industry or in our operations specifically. in addition, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) or the sec could enact new accounting standards that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. risks related to market volatility and risk measurement and hedging activities our risk measurement and hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. although we have systems in place that use various methodologies to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses, these systems might not always be followed or might not always be effective. further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, (sfas 133) to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under sfas 133, must be recorded in our income. this creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to the company has occurred during the applicable period. the impact of changes in market prices for natural gas on the average gas prices received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging strategies. these hedging arrangements may limit our potential gains if the market prices for natural gas were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. in addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: production is less than expected; the hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating the risk being hedged; the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments. 28 table of contents risks related to employees, outsourcing of non-core support activities, and technology institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility might not be adequately preserved. in certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. as these employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. failure of or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing relationships. although we have taken steps to build a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our outsourcing providers and to closely monitor their performance, a deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be able to conduct our business. certain of our accounting, information technology, application development, and help desk services are currently provided by an outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide services to us present similar risks of business operations located outside of the united states previously discussed, including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. risks related to weather, other natural phenomena and business disruption our assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can be adversely affected by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport or distribute natural gas, natural gas liquids or other commodities. acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 74 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. the majority of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. the tables below provide information about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2007 and 2006. long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. fair value

(5) includes transco subsequent refinancing of its $100 million notes, due on january 15, 2008, under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. (see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements.) commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts and our proprietary trading activities. we manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to changes in energy-commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. we measure the risk in our portfolios using a value-at-risk methodology to estimate the potential one-day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios. 74 table of contents value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolios. our value-at-risk model uses a monte carlo method to simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent probability that the one-day loss in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at risk. the simulation method uses historical correlations and market forward prices and volatilities. in applying the value-at-risk methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical movements affect the positions or would cause any potential liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one-day holding period to execute. while a one-day holding period has historically been the industry standard, a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints. we segregate our derivative contracts into trading and nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. we calculate value at risk separately for these two categories. derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales under sfas 133 and nonderivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk. trading our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity price-risk exposure. our value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was approximately $1 million at both december 31, 2007 and 2006. during the year ended december 31, 2007, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $2 million to a low of $1 million. nontrading our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the following activities: segment commodity price risk exposure exploration production natural gas sales midstream natural gas purchases ngl sales gas marketing services natural gas purchases and sales the value at risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes was $24 million at december 31, 2007 and $12 million at december 31, 2006. during the year ended december 31, 2007, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $24 million to a low of $7 million. the increase in value at risk reflects the impact on our nontrading portfolio of the sale of substantially all of our power business in november 2007. certain of the derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas 133. though these contracts are included in our value-at-risk calculation, any change in the fair value of these hedge contracts would generally not be reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item affects earnings. foreign currency risk we have international investments that could affect our financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or the economic conditions in foreign countries. international investments accounted for under the cost method totaled $24 million at december 31, 2007, and $42 million at december 31, 2006. these investments are primarily in nonpublicly traded companies for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value. we believe that we can realize the carrying value of these investments considering the status of the operations of the companies underlying these investments. if a 20 percent change 75 table of contents occurred in the value of the underlying currencies of these investments against the u.s. dollar, the fair value at december 31, 2007, could change by approximately $5 million assuming a direct correlation between the currency fluctuation and the value of the investments. net assets of consolidated foreign operations, whose functional currency is the local currency, are located primarily in canada and approximate 7 percent and 6 percent of our net assets at december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in other currencies. however, these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position, due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of re-measuring the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the respective functional currencies against the u.s. dollar could have changed stockholders equity by approximately $88 million at december 31, 2007. 76 table of contentsforward looking statements/risk factors and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 19 risk factors 20 risk factors forward-looking statements/risk factors and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 certain matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these statements discuss our expected future results based on current and pending business operations. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, might, planned, potential, projects, scheduled or similar expressions. these forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding: amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; financial condition and liquidity; business strategy; estimates of proved gas and oil reserves; reserve potential; development drilling potential; cash flow from operations or results of operations; seasonality of certain business segments; natural gas and ngl prices and demand. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or project. specific factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include: availability of supplies (including the uncertainties inherent in assessing, estimating, acquiring and developing future natural gas reserves), market demand, volatility of prices, and the availability and costs of capital; inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and general economic conditions (including the recent economic slowdown and the disruption of global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers); the strength and financial resources of our competitors; development of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and development hazards; costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations (including proposed climate change legislation), environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings; 19 table of contents our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in the current geopolitical situation; risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements, future changes in our credit ratings and the availability and cost of credit; risks associated with future weather conditions; acts of terrorism and additional risks described in our filings with the sec. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. risks inherent to our industry and business the long-term financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets, and the prices of and market demand for natural gas. the development of the additional natural gas reserves that are essential for our gas transportation and midstream businesses to thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production, gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems. low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development and production of additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline transportation and import and export of natural gas supplies, adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our gathering, transportation and processing facilities. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline will also naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. additionally, the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. accordingly, to maintain or increase the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas transported on our pipeline and cash flows associated with the transportation of natural gas, our customers must compete with others to obtain adequate supplies of natural gas. in addition, if natural gas prices in the supply basins connected to our pipeline systems are higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions, our ability to compete with other transporters may be negatively impacted on a short-term basis, as well as with respect to our long-term recontracting activities. if new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply areas, or if natural gas supplies are diverted to 20 table of contents serve other markets, the overall volume of natural gas transported and stored on our system would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, new lng import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transportation facilities. significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand and cause a termination of our transportation and storage contracts or a reduction in throughput on our system. higher natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in our long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on our gas pipelines systems. also, lower natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the production of natural gas resulting in reduced contracts or throughput on our gas pipelines systems. as a result, significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves. our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations and debt and equity issuances. future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas, and our success in developing and producing new reserves. if our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we may not be able to access additional bank debt, issue debt or equity securities or access other methods of financing on an economic basis to meet our capital expenditure budget. as a result, our capital expenditure plans may have to be adjusted. failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business. the growth of our exploration production business depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. we may not be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. if natural gas prices increase, our costs for additional reserves would also increase, conversely if natural gas prices decrease, it could make it more difficult to fund the replacement of our reserves. exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves. our past success rate for drilling projects should not be considered a predictor of future commercial success. we do not always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our drilling operations. the new wells we drill or participate in may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in wells we drill or participate in. the cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. our efforts will be unprofitable if we drill dry wells or wells that are productive but do not produce enough reserves to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment, skilled labor, capital or transportation; unexpected drilling conditions or problems; regulations and regulatory approvals; changes or anticipated changes in energy prices; and compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements. 21 table of contents estimating reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties. negative revisions to reserve estimates, oil and gas prices or assumptions as to future natural gas prices may lead to decreased earnings, losses or impairment of oil and gas assets, including related goodwill. reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. reserves that are proved reserves are those estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects. the process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. the reserve data included in this report represent estimates. in addition, the estimates of future net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be correct. quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment. changes to oil and gas prices in the markets for such commodities may have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve estimates. if negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. these revisions, as well as revisions in the assumptions of future cash flows of these reserves, may also be sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties which would result in a non-cash charge to earnings. the revisions could also possibly affect the evaluation of exploration production goodwill for impairment purposes. at december 31, 2008, we had approximately $1 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet. certain of our services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues we collect for our services. although most of the services provided by our interstate gas pipelines are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. we depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. the loss of any of these key customers or the loss of any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our business. our gas pipelines rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of their revenues. the loss of even a portion of our contracted volumes, as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our business. generally our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered credit worthy, are required to make pre-payments, or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including declines in our customers creditworthiness. while 22 table of contents we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves, it is possible that we may have to write down or write off doubtful accounts. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. the failure of new sources of natural gas production or liquid natural gas (lng) import terminals to be successfully developed in north america could increase natural gas prices and reduce the demand for our services. new sources of natural gas production in the united states and canada, particularly in areas of shale development are expected to become an increasingly significant component of future natural gas supplies in north america. additionally, increases in lng supplies are expected to be imported through new lng import terminals, particularly in the gulf coast region. if these additional sources of supply are not developed, natural gas prices could increase and cause consumers of natural gas to turn to alternative energy sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our drilling, production, gathering, processing, storage and transporting activities involve numerous risks that might result in accidents, and other operating risks and hazards. our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards typically associated with the development and exploration for, and the production and transportation of oil and gas. these operating risks include, but are not limited to: fires, blowouts, cratering and explosions; uncontrollable releases of oil, natural gas or well fluids; pollution and other environmental risks; natural disasters; aging infrastructure; damage inadvertently caused by third party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; and terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies. these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the location of certain segments of our pipelines in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. in spite of our precautions, an event such as those described above could cause considerable harm to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers. such circumstances, including those arising from maintenance and repair activities, could result in service interruptions on segments of our pipeline infrastructure. potential customer impacts arising from service interruptions on segments of our pipeline infrastructure could include limitations on the pipeline ability to satisfy customer requirements, obligations to provide reservations charge credits to customers in times of constrained capacity, and solicitation of existing customers by others for potential new pipeline projects that would compete directly with existing services. such circumstances could materially impact our ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers, with a resulting negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the ability of the insurers we do use to satisfy our claims. we are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business, including environmental accidents that might occur. in addition, we do not maintain business interruption insurance in the type and amount to cover all possible risks of loss. we currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $610 million per occurrence and in the 23 table of contents aggregate annually and a deductible of $2 million per occurrence. this insurance covers us and our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury, personal injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. this excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and ngl operations. pollution liability coverage excludes: release of pollutants subsequent to their disposal; release of substances arising from the combustion of fuels that result in acidic deposition, and testing, monitoring, clean-up, containment, treatment or removal of pollutants from property owned, occupied by, rented to, used by or in the care, custody or control of us or our affiliates. we do not insure onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at river crossings and at certain locations such as compressor stations. we maintain coverage of $300 million per occurrence for physical damage to onshore assets and resulting business interruption caused by terrorist acts. we also maintain coverage of $100 million per occurrence for physical damage to offshore assets caused by terrorist acts, except for our devils tower spar where we maintain terrorism limits of $300 million per occurrence for property damage and $105 million per occurrence for resulting business interruption. also, all of our insurance is subject to deductibles. if a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured, it could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. changes in the insurance markets subsequent to the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and hurricanes katrina, rita, gustav and ike have impacted the availability of certain types of coverage at reasonable rates, and we may elect to self insure a portion of our asset portfolio. we cannot assure you that we will in the future be able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would otherwise have obtained prior to these market changes or that the insurance coverage we do obtain will not contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. the occurrence of any operating risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, certain insurance companies that provide coverage to us, including american international group, inc., have experienced negative developments that could impair their ability to pay any of our potential claims. as a result, we could be exposed to greater losses than anticipated and may have to obtain replacement insurance, if available, at a greater cost. execution of our capital projects subjects us to construction risks, increases in labor and materials costs and other risks that may adversely affect financial results. a significant portion of our growth in the gas pipeline and midstream business areas is accomplished through the construction of new pipelines, processing and storage facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities. construction of these facilities is subject to various regulatory, development and operational risks, including: the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; the availability of skilled labor, equipment, and materials to complete expansion projects; potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; impediments on our ability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; the ability to construct projects within estimated costs, including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment, materials, labor, or other factors beyond our control, that may be material; and the ability to access capital markets to fund construction projects. any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding, delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs. as a result, new facilities may not achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 24 table of contents our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other post-retirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors we control, including changes to pension plan benefits as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition. the amount of expenses recorded for our defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans is also dependent on changes in several factors, including market interest rates and the returns on plan assets. significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our future results of operations. two of our subsidiaries act as the respective general partners of two different publicly-traded limited partnerships, williams partners l.p. and williams pipeline partners l.p. as such, those subsidiaries operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz and another subsidiary of ours acts as the general partner of wmz. each of these subsidiaries that act as the general partner of a publicly-traded limited partnership may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to the limited partnership of which it serves as the general partner and to the limited partners of such limited partnership. activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interests is found to exist. our control of the general partners of two different publicly traded partnerships may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise (i) between the two publicly-traded partnerships as well as (ii) between a publicly-traded partnership, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material. potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosures in the future, which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance. regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial disclosures, companies relationships with their independent registered public accounting firms, and retirement plan practices. we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies or the energy industry or in our operations specifically. in addition, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) or the sec could enact new accounting standards that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. our risk measurement and hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. although we have systems in place that use various methodologies to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses, these systems might not always be followed or might not always be effective. further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within 25 table of contents guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, (sfas 133) to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) 133, must be recorded in our income. this creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to the company has occurred during the applicable period. the impact of changes in market prices for natural gas on the average gas prices received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging strategies. these hedging arrangements may limit our potential gains if the market prices for natural gas were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. in addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: production is less than expected; the hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating the risk being hedged; and the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments. our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects. we currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries where we have interests or in which we might explore development, acquisition or investment opportunities present risks of delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain non-recourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments. recent events in certain south american countries, particularly the continued threat of nationalization of certain energy-related assets in venezuela, could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. we may not receive adequate compensation, or any compensation, if our assets in venezuela are nationalized. operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. in certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to u.s. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. in addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. in such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. we may or may not put contracts in place designed to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. we have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations. our operating results for certain segments of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. revenues from certain segments of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary 26 table of contents significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. additionally, changes in the price of natural gas could benefit one of our business units, but disadvantage another. for example, our exploration production business may benefit from higher natural gas prices, and midstream, which uses gas as a feedstock, may not. risks related to strategy and financing our debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to create liens supporting indebtedness, sell assets, make certain distributions, and incur additional debt. in addition, our debt agreements contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by many events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that our future operating results will be sufficient to comply with the covenants or, in the event of a default under any of our debt agreements, to remedy that default. our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements and other related transactional documents could result in events of default. upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. an event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt agreement. such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. if an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under such debt agreements. our ability to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or obtain future credit on favorable terms, if at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. events in the global credit markets created a shortage in the availability of credit and have led to credit market volatility. in 2008, global credit markets experienced a shortage in overall liquidity and a resulting disruption in the availability of credit. while we cannot predict the occurrence of future disruptions or the duration of the current volatility in the credit markets, we believe cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities, as well as availability under our existing financing agreements will provide us with adequate liquidity. however, our ability to borrow under our existing financing agreements, including our bank credit facilities, could be negatively impacted if one or more of our lenders fail to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us. continuing volatility or additional disruptions, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, may adversely affect the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future. the continuation of recent economic conditions, including disruptions in the global credit markets, could adversely affect our results of operations. the slowdown in the economy and the significant disruptions and volatility in global credit markets have the potential to negatively impact our businesses in many ways. included among these potential negative impacts are reduced demand and lower prices for our products and services, increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers and a reduction in our credit ratings (either due to tighter rating standards or the negative impacts described above), which could result in reducing our access to credit markets, raising the cost of such access or requiring us to provide additional collateral to our counterparties. 27 table of contents a downgrade of our current credit ratings could impact our liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business, and maintaining current credit ratings is within the control of independent third parties. a downgrade of our credit rating might increase our cost of borrowing and would require us to post additional collateral with third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. our ability to access capital markets would also be limited by a downgrade of our credit rating and other disruptions. such disruptions could include: economic downturns; deteriorating capital market conditions; declining market prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids and other commodities; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies; and the overall health of the energy industry, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. the analysis includes a number of criteria including, but not limited to, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. our corporate family credit rating and the credit ratings of transco and northwest pipeline were raised to investment grade in 2007 by standard poor s, moody corporation, and fitch ratings, ltd., and our senior unsecured debt ratings were raised to investment grade by moody and fitch. no assurance can be given that the credit rating agencies will continue to assign us investment grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their criteria for investment grade ratios or that our senior unsecured debt rating will be raised to investment grade by all of the credit rating agencies. prices for natural gas liquids, natural gas and other commodities are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of certain segments of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices we receive for ngls, natural gas, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities. price volatility can impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. the markets for ngls, natural gas and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, petroleum, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and level of foreign imports; 28 table of contents domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; volatility in the natural gas markets; the overall economic environment; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold; and the adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate change. we might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets. our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts may consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including contracts for natural gas, ngls and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash throughout the united states. if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage, it could negatively affect our results of operations. in the past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. in certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. if such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our contracts, we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. in addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our counterparties. despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. if the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty obligation is inadequate, we will suffer a loss. a general downturn in the economy and tightening of global credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than we have expected. risks related to regulations that affect our industry our natural gas sales, transmission, and storage operations are subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. our interstate natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations conducted through our gas pipelines business are subject to the ferc rules and regulations in accordance with the nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978. the ferc regulatory authority extends to: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms and conditions of service, including initiation and discontinuation of services; certification and construction of new facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; relationships with marketing functions within williams involved in certain aspects of the natural gas business; and market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas. regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our business. regulatory decisions could also affect our costs for compression, processing and dehydration of natural gas, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations. the ferc has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased competition throughout the industry. in a number of key markets, interstate pipelines are now facing 29 table of contents competitive pressure from other major pipeline systems, enabling local distribution companies and end users to choose a transportation provider based on considerations other than location. costs of environmental liabilities and complying with existing and future environmental regulations, including those related to greenhouse gas emissions, could exceed our current expectations. our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial, state and municipal laws and regulations. such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, extraction, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment, and in connection with the operation, maintenance, abandonment and reclamation of our facilities. compliance with environmental laws requires significant expenditures, including for clean up costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. in addition, the possible failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations might result in the imposition of fines and penalties. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. although we do not expect that the costs of complying with current environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, no assurance can be given that the costs of complying with environmental laws in the future will not have such an effect. legislative and regulatory responses related to climate change create financial risk. the united states congress and certain states have for some time been considering various forms of legislation related to greenhouse gas emissions. increased public awareness and concern may result in more state, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases. numerous states have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce greenhouse gases and similar federal legislation has been introduced in both houses of congress. our pipeline, exploration and production and gas processing facilities may be subject to regulation under climate change policies introduced at either the state or federal level within the next few years. there is a possibility that, when and if enacted, the final form of such legislation could increase our costs of compliance with environmental laws. if we are unable to recover or pass through all costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. to the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. we make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. if the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions may change. our regulatory rate structure and our contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new environmental regulations. also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for certain development projects. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our results of operations. competition in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our results of operations. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. other companies with which we compete may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater 30 table of contents financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. we may not be able to maintain or replace expiring natural gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis. our primary exposure to market risk for our gas pipelines occurs at the time the terms of their existing transportation and storage contracts expire and are subject to termination. although none of our gas pipelines material contracts are terminable in 2009, upon expiration of the terms we may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers to obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis. the extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including: the level of existing and new competition to deliver natural gas to our markets; the growth in demand for natural gas in our markets; whether the market will continue to support long-term firm contracts; whether our business strategy continues to be successful; the level of competition for natural gas supplies in the production basins serving us; and the effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices. any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipeline and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our natural gas pipeline and storage facilities. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or other facilities were to become unavailable due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or for any other reason, our ability to operate efficiently and continue shipping natural gas to end-use markets could be restricted, thereby reducing our revenues. further, although there are laws and regulations designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions, some companies may fail to provide fair and equal access to their transportation systems or may not provide sufficient transportation capacity for other market participants. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect causing a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipeline or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our businesses are subject to complex government regulations. the operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us, our facilities or our customers, and future changes in laws and regulations might have a detrimental effect on our business. specifically, the colorado oil gas conservation commission has enacted new rules effective in april 2009 which will increase our costs of permitting and environmental compliance and may affect our ability to meet our anticipated drilling schedule and therefore may have a material effect on our results of operations. legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry and capital markets have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being either proposed or implemented. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations 31 table of contents and court proceedings in which we are a named defendant. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing and continue to adversely affect our business as a whole. we might see these adverse effects continue as a result of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters against us arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including environmental matters, disputes over gas measurement, royalty payments, shareholder class action suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. risks related to employees, outsourcing of non-core support activities, and technology institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility might not be adequately preserved. in certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. as these employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. failure of or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing relationships. although we have taken steps to build a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our outsourcing providers and to closely monitor their performance, a deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be able to conduct our business. the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to similar losses of institutional knowledge or disruptions. certain of our accounting, information technology, application development, and help desk services are currently provided by an outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide services to us present similar risks of business operations located outside of the united states previously discussed, including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. risks related to weather, other natural phenomena and business disruption our assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. insurance may be inadequate, and in some instances, we may be unable to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. a significant disruption in operations or a significant liability for which we were not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 32 table of contents in addition, there is a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases may be linked to global climate change. climate change creates physical and financial risk. our customers energy needs vary with weather conditions. to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change or demand is impacted by regulations associated with climate change, customers energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes, leading to either increased investment or decreased revenues. acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport or distribute natural gas, natural gas liquids or other commodities. acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 75 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. the majority of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. the tables below provide information about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2008 and 2007. long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. fair value december 31, 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 thereafter(1) total 2008 (dollars in millions) long-term debt, including current

venezuelan subsidiaries that is in technical default and classified as current on our consolidated balance sheet. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts and our proprietary trading activities. we manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to changes in energy-commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. we measure the risk in our portfolios using a value-at-risk methodology to estimate the potential one-day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios. 75 table of contents value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolios. our value-at-risk model uses a monte carlo method to simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent probability that the one-day loss in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at risk. the simulation method uses historical correlations and market forward prices and volatilities. in applying the value-at-risk methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical movements affect the positions or would cause any potential liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one-day holding period to execute. while a one-day holding period has historically been the industry standard, a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints. we segregate our derivative contracts into trading and nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. we calculate value at risk separately for these two categories. derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales under sfas no. 133 and nonderivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk. trading our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity price-risk exposure. the fair value of our trading derivatives was a net liability of $29 million at december 31, 2008. our value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was $0.2 million at december 31, 2008, and $1 million at december 31, 2007. during the year ended december 31, 2008, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $3.3 million to a low of $0.2 million. nontrading our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the following activities: segment commodity price risk exposure exploration production natural gas sales midstream natural gas purchases gas marketing services natural gas purchases and sales the fair value of our nontrading derivatives was a net asset of $511 million at december 31, 2008. the value at risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes was $33 million at december 31, 2008, and $24 million at december 31, 2007. during the year ended december 31, 2008, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $72 million to a low of $33 million. the increase in value at risk reflects the impact on our nontrading portfolio of the increase in volumes of exploration production hedges in 2009 and 2010. derivative contracts included in our assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are included in the nontrading portfolio, but these had a value at risk of zero for both periods. certain of the derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no. 133. of the total fair value of nontrading derivatives, sfas no. 133 cash flow hedges had a net asset value of $458 million as of december 31, 2008. though these contracts are included in our value-at-risk calculation, any change in the fair value of the effective portion of these hedge contracts would generally not be reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item affects earnings. trading policy we have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk management activities. these policies cover authority and delegation thereof in addition to control requirements, authorized commodities and term and exposure limitations. value-at-risk is limited in aggregate and calculated at a 95 percent confidence level. 76 table of contents foreign currency risk we have international investments that could affect our financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or the economic conditions in foreign countries. international investments accounted for under the cost method totaled $17 million at december 31, 2008, and $24 million at december 31, 2007. these investments are primarily in nonpublicly traded companies for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value. we believe that we can realize the carrying value of these investments considering the status of the operations of the companies underlying these investments. net assets of consolidated foreign operations, whose functional currency is the local currency, are located primarily in canada and approximate 5 percent and 7 percent of our net assets at december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in other currencies. however, these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position, due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the respective functional currencies against the u.s. dollar would have changed stockholders equity by approximately $84 million at december 31, 2008. 77 table of contentsrisk factors 21 risk factors forward-looking statements and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 certain matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, seeks, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, intends, might, goals, objectives, targets, planned, potential, projects, scheduled, will or other similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding: amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; financial condition and liquidity; business strategy; cash flow from operations or results of operations; seasonality of certain business components; natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil prices and demand. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: availability of supplies, market demand, volatility of prices, and the availability and cost of capital; inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers); the strength and financial resources of our competitors; ability to acquire new businesses and assets and integrate those operations and assets into our existing businesses, as well as expand our facilities; development of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and development hazards; costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations (including safety and climate change regulation and changes in natural gas production from exploration and production areas that we serve), environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings; 21 our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in maintenance and construction costs; changes in the current geopolitical situation; our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties; risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements, future changes in our credit ratings and the availability and cost of credit; risks associated with future weather conditions; acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions; additional risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. 22 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. risks related to the spin-off the separation of our exploration and production business may not achieve its intended results. the separation of our exploration and production business, completed on december 31, 2011, may not achieve its intended results and could have an adverse effect on us due to a number of factors. for example, the separation has significantly reduced the scope and scale of our business, we may not be able to grow as expected and we may incur proportionately higher costs to operate. if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations, or undertakings underlying an irs private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities. in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service (irs) and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain, or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the internal revenue code of 1986 (the code), except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain, or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities. the spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements that we did not assume in our agreements with wpx. the spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. a court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. under the separation and distribution agreement between us and wpx, from and after the spin-off, each of wpx and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which each owns and operates. although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and 23 distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to wpx, particularly if wpx were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations. risks related to our business the long-term financial condition of our natural gas pipeline and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets, and the prices of and market demand for natural gas. the development of the additional natural gas reserves that are essential for our gas pipeline and midstream businesses to thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production, gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems. low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, including environmental regulations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development and production of additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline transportation and import and export of natural gas supplies, adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our gathering, transportation and processing facilities. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will also naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. additionally, the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. accordingly, to maintain or increase the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas transported on or gathered through our pipeline systems and cash flows associated with the gathering and transportation of natural gas, our customers must compete with others to obtain adequate supplies of natural gas. in addition, if natural gas prices in the supply basins connected to our pipeline systems are higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions, our ability to compete with other transporters may be negatively impacted on a short-term basis, as well as with respect to our long-term recontracting activities. if new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply areas, if natural gas supplies are diverted to serve other markets, if development in new supply basins where we do not have significant gathering or pipeline systems reduces demand for our services, or if environmental regulators restrict new natural gas drilling, the overall volume of natural gas transported, gathered and stored on our system would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, new lng import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transportation facilities. significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand and cause a termination of our long-term transportation and storage contracts or a reduction in throughput on the gas pipeline systems. higher natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on our gas pipeline systems. also, lower natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the production of natural gas resulting in reduced contracts or throughput on the gas pipeline systems. as a result, significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our gas pipeline business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. prices for ngls, natural gas and other commodities, including oil, are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain our existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of ngls, natural gas, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between 24 prices of these commodities. price volatility can impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. any of the foregoing can also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the markets for ngls, natural gas, oil and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, oil, petroleum, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and quantity of foreign imports of natural gas and oil; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; volatility in the natural gas and oil markets; the overall economic environment; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold; the adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate change and changes in natural gas production from exploration and production areas that we serve. we might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets. our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts may consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including contracts for natural gas, ngls and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash throughout the united states. if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage, it could negatively affect our results of operations. in the past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. in certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. if such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our contracts, we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. in addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our counterparties. despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. if the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty obligation is inadequate, we will suffer a loss. downturns in the economy or disruptions in the global credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than we expect. 25 certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues they collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. we may not be able to maintain or replace expiring natural gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis. our primary exposure to market risk for our gas pipelines occurs at the time the terms of their existing transportation and storage contracts expire and are subject to termination. upon expiration of the terms, we may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers to obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis. the extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including: the level of existing and new competition to deliver natural gas to our markets; the growth in demand for natural gas in our markets; whether the market will continue to support long-term firm contracts; whether our business strategy continues to be successful; the level of competition for natural gas supplies in the production basins serving us; the effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices. any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our risk management and measurement systems and hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. the systems we use to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses might not always be followed or might not always be effective. further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used and may in the future use fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. 26 our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under gaap, must be recorded in our income. this creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to us has occurred during the applicable period. the impact of changes in market prices for ngls and natural gas on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging activities. these hedging arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market prices for ngls or natural gas were to change substantially from the price established by the hedges. in addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: volumes are less than expected; the hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating the risk being hedged; the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments. the adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities. in july 2010, federal legislation known as the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the act) was enacted. the act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including oil and gas hedging transactions. among other things, the act provides for the creation of position limits for certain derivatives transactions, as well as requiring certain transactions to be cleared on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required. the final impact of the act on our hedging activities is uncertain at this time due to the requirement that the sec and the commodities futures trading commission (cftc) promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within 360 days from the date of enactment. these new rules and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts or reduce the availability of derivatives. although we believe the derivative contracts that we enter into should not be impacted by position limits and should be exempt from the requirement to clear transactions through a central exchange or to post collateral, the impact upon our businesses will depend on the outcome of the implementing regulations adopted by the cftc. depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the cftc or similar rules that may be adopted by other regulatory bodies, we might in the future be required to provide cash collateral for our commodities hedging transactions under circumstances in which we do not currently post cash collateral. posting of such additional cash collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our cash available for capital expenditures. a requirement to post cash collateral could therefore reduce our ability to execute hedges to reduce commodity price uncertainty and thus protect cash flows. if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. we depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. the loss of any of these key customers or the loss of any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our business. our gas pipeline and midstream businesses rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of their revenues. although some of these customers are subject to long-term contracts, extensions or replacements of these contracts may not be renegotiated on favorable terms, if at all. the loss of all, or even a portion of the revenues from natural gas, ngls or contracted volumes, as applicable, supplied by these customers, as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, unless we are able to acquire comparable volumes from other sources. 27 we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and our credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk. we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including declines in our customers and counterparties creditworthiness. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write-down or write-off doubtful accounts. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. other companies with which we compete may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. similarly, a highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. as a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which they may not be adequately insured. there are operational risks associated with gathering, transporting, storage, processing and treating of natural gas and the fractionation and storage of ngls, including: hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, extreme weather conditions, and other natural disasters; aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), ngls, brine or industrial chemicals; collapse or failure of storage caverns; operator error; damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; pollution and other environmental risks; fires, explosions, craterings and blowouts; risks related to truck and rail loading and unloading; risks related to operating in a marine environment; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies. 28 any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. in spite of our precautions, an event such as those described above could cause considerable harm to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers. our costs of testing, maintaining or repairing our facilities may exceed our expectations and the ferc or competition in our markets may not allow us to recover such costs in the rates we charge for our services. we have experienced unexpected leaks or ruptures on one of our gas pipeline systems, including a rupture near appomattox, virginia in 2008 and a rupture near sweet water, alabama in 2011. we could experience additional unexpected leaks or ruptures on our gas pipeline systems, or be required by regulatory authorities to test or undertake modifications to our systems that could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations if the costs of testing, maintaining or repairing our facilities exceed current expectations and the ferc or competition in our markets do not allow us to recover such costs in the rates we charge for our service. for example, in response to a recent third-party pipeline rupture, phmsa issued an advisory bulletin which, among other things, advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design, construction, inspection, testing, or other data to determine the pressures at which their pipelines should operate, the records of that data must be traceable, verifiable and complete. more recently, the pipeline safety, regulatory certainty, and job creation act of 2011 became law and under this statute phmsa may issue additional regulations addressing such records. locating such records and, in the absence of any such records, verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the demands of such pressures, could significantly increase our costs. additionally, failure to locate such records or verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. we are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business, including environmental accidents. we do not maintain insurance in the type and amount to cover all possible risks of loss. we currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $610 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate with $2 million per occurrence deductible. this insurance covers us, our subsidiaries, and certain of our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. this excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and ngl operations. although we maintain property insurance on certain physical assets that we own, lease or are responsible to insure, the policy may not cover the full replacement cost of all damaged assets or the entire amount of business interruption loss we may experience. in addition, certain perils may be excluded from coverage or sub-limited. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. we may elect to self insure a portion of our risks. we do not insure our onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at certain locations such as river crossings and compressor stations. offshore assets are covered for property damage when loss is due to a named windstorm event and coverage for loss caused by a named windstorm is significantly sub-limited and subject to a large deductible. all of our insurance is subject to deductibles. if a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured it could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. 29 in addition, to the insurance coverage described above, we are a member of oil insurance limited (oil), an energy industry mutual insurance company, which provides coverage for damage to our property. as an insured of oil, we share in the losses among other oil members even if our property is not damaged. furthermore, any insurance company that provides coverage to us may experience negative developments that could impair their ability to pay any of our claims. as a result, we could be exposed to greater losses than anticipated and may have to obtain replacement insurance, if available, at a greater cost. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to repay our debt. execution of our capital projects subjects us to construction risks, increases in labor costs and materials, and other risks that may adversely affect financial results. the growth in our gas pipeline and midstream businesses may be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines and facilities or natural gas liquids fractionation or storage facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities. construction or expansion of these facilities is subject to various regulatory, development and operational risks, including: the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; the availability of skilled labor, equipment, and materials to complete expansion projects; potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; impediments on our ability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; the ability to construct projects within estimated costs, including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment, materials, labor, or other factors beyond our control, that may be material; the ability to access capital markets to fund construction projects. any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding, delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs. as a result, new facilities may not achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, williams partners l.p. as such, this subsidiary operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz, a publicly traded limited partnership. this subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to wpz as the general partner and to the limited partners of wpz. activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may 30 involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interests is found to exist. our control of the general partner of wpz may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise between wpz, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material. potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosures in the future, which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance. regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial disclosures, and companies relationships with their independent public accounting firms. it remains unclear what new laws or regulations will be adopted, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact that any such new laws or regulations could have. in addition, the financial accounting standards board, the sec or ferc could enact new accounting standards or ferc could issue rules that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. any significant change in accounting standards or disclosure requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects. we currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the united states. the economic, political and legal conditions and regulatory environment in the countries in which we have interests or in which we might pursue acquisition or investment opportunities present risks that are different from or greater than those in the united states. these risks include delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, including with respect to the prices we realize for the commodities we produce and sell. the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain nonrecourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments. operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. in certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to u.s. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. in addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. in such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. we may or may not put contracts in place designed to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. we have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations. our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. 31 we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited term. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and cash flows. risks related to strategy and financing our debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may limit our access to credit and adversely affect our ability to operate our business. certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability and our material subsidiaries ability to grant certain liens to support indebtedness, our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets, enter into certain affiliate transactions, make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt. in addition, our debt agreements contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. these covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in, expand or pursue our business activities and prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. if market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our current assumptions about future economic conditions turn out to be incorrect or unexpected events occur, our ability to comply with these covenants may be significantly impaired. our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements could result in events of default. upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. certain payment defaults or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt agreement. such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. if an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under such debt agreements. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management discussion and analysis of financial condition and liquidity. our ability to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or obtain future credit on favorable terms, if at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. 32 our cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of wpz our partnership interest in wpz is one of our largest cash-generating assets. therefore, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of wpz to make distributions to its partners. a significant decline in wpz earnings and/or distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us. difficult conditions in the global capital markets, the credit markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations. our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services, increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers and a reduction in our credit ratings (either due to tighter rating standards or the negative impacts described above), which could reduce our access to credit markets, raise the cost of such access or require us to provide additional collateral to our counterparties. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. a downgrade of our credit ratings could impact our liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business, and independent third parties outside our control determine our credit ratings. a downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to post collateral with third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. our ability to access capital markets could also be limited by a downgrade of our credit ratings and other disruptions. such disruptions could include: economic downturns; deteriorating capital market conditions; declining market prices for natural gas, ngls, oil and other commodities; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies; the overall health of the energy industry, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. the analysis includes a number of criteria including, but not limited to, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold investments in the rated entity. ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies, and no assurance can be given that we will maintain our current credit ratings or that our senior unsecured debt rating will be raised to investment grade by all of the credit rating agencies. our acquisition attempts may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipated. we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of businesses and properties. however, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. the following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions, including any completed or future acquisitions: some of the acquired businesses or properties may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels or could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or that exceed our estimates; we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operationally, technical or financial problems; acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures. 33 risks related to regulations that affect our industry our gas pipelines could be subject to penalties and fines if they fail to comply with laws governing our businesses. our gas pipeline transportation and storage operations are regulated by numerous governmental agencies including the ferc, the epa and phmsa. should our gas pipelines fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders, they could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. under the energy policy act of 2005, ferc has civil penalty authority under the nga to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1,000,000 per day for each violation and under the recently enacted pipeline safety, regulatory certainty, and job creation act of 2011, phmsa has civil penalty authority up to $200,000 per day (from the prior $100,000), with a maximum of $2 million for any related series of violations (from the prior $1 million). any material penalties or fines under these or other statutes, rules, regulations or orders could have a material adverse impact on our gas pipeline business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the natural gas sales, transportation and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. the natural gas sales, transmission and storage operations of the gas pipelines are subject to federal, state and local regulatory authorities. specifically, their interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. the federal regulation extends to such matters as: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms, and conditions of service, including initiation and discontinuation of service; the types of services the gas pipelines may offer their customers; certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas. under the nga, ferc has authority to regulate providers of natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services in interstate commerce, and such providers may only charge rates that have been determined to be just and reasonable by ferc. in addition, ferc prohibits providers from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business. unlike other interstate pipelines that own facilities in the offshore gulf of mexico, transco charges its transportation customers a separate fee to access its offshore facilities. the separate charge is referred to as an it feeder charge. the it feeder rate is charged only when gas is actually transported on the facilities and typically it is paid by producers or marketers. because the it feeder rate is typically paid by producers and marketers, it generally results in netback prices to producers that are slightly lower than the netbacks realized by producers transporting on other interstate pipelines. this rate design disparity can result in producers bypassing transco offshore facilities in favor of alternative transportation facilities. 34 the rates, terms and conditions for interstate gas pipeline services are set forth in ferc-approved tariffs. any successful complaint or protest against the rates of the gas pipelines could have an adverse impact on their revenues associated with providing transportation services. in addition, there is a risk that rates set by ferc in future rate cases filed by the gas pipelines will be inadequate to recover increases in operating costs or to sustain an adequate return on capital investments. there is also the risk that higher rates would cause their customers to look for alternative ways to transport natural gas. we are subject to risks associated with climate change. there is a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs) may be linked to climate change. climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts and the regulation of ghgs have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing our products and services, the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks. in addition, legislative and regulatory responses related to ghgs and climate change create the potential for financial risk. the u.s. congress and certain states have for some time been considering various forms of legislation related to ghg emissions. there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of ghgs. in addition, increased public awareness and concern may result in more state, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions. numerous states and other jurisdictions have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce ghgs. in 2009, the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) issued a final determination that six ghgs are a threat to public safety and welfare. in 2011, the epa implemented permitting for new and/or modified large sources of ghg emissions through the existing prevention of signification deterioration permitting program. additional direct regulation of ghg emissions in our industry may be implemented under other clean air act programs, including the new source performance standards program. the recent actions of the epa and the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities, and (iii) administer and manage any ghg emissions program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. our operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities and expenditures and could exceed current expectations. substantial costs, liabilities, delays and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing and treating of natural gas and fractionation of ngls, and as a result, we may be required to make substantial expenditures that could exceed current expectations. our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, native american, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, the discharge of materials into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. these laws include: clean air act (caa), and analogous state laws, which impose obligations related to air emissions; clean water act (cwa), and analogous state laws, which regulate discharge of wastewaters and storm water from our facilities to state and federal waters, including wetlands; 35 comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (cercla), and analogous state laws, which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal; resource conservation and recovery act (rcra), and analogous state laws, which impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities. endangered species act (esa), and analogous state laws, which seek to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animals, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species; oil pollution act (opa) of 1990, which requires oil storage facilities and vessels to submit plans to the federal government detailing how they will respond to large discharges, regulates petroleum storage tanks and related equipment, and imposes liability for spills by responsible parties. various governmental authorities, including the epa, the u.s. department of the interior, the bureau of indian affairs and analogous state agencies and tribal governments, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, delays in granting permits and cancellation of leases. there is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our business, some of which may be material, due to our handling of the products as they are gathered, transported, processed, fractionated and stored, air emissions related to our operations, historical industry operations, and waste and waste disposal practices, and the prior use of flow meters containing mercury. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, including cercla, rcra, and analogous state laws, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil and wastes on, under, or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. in addition, increasingly strict laws, regulations and enforcement policies could materially increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. in march 2010, the epa announced its national enforcement initiatives for 2011 to 2013, which includes the addition of energy extraction activities to its enforcement priorities list. to address its concerns regarding the pollution risks raised by new techniques for oil and gas extraction and coal mining, the epa is developing an initiative to ensure that energy extraction activities are complying with federal environmental requirements. we cannot predict what the results of this initiative would be, or whether federal, state, or local laws or regulations will be enacted in this area. if regulations were imposed related to oil and gas extraction, the volumes of natural gas that we transport could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected. our business may be adversely affected by changed regulations and increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from noncompliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operations. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or 36 if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation or construction of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. hydraulic fracturing is exempt from federal regulation pursuant to the federal safe drinking water act (except when the fracturing fluids or propping agents contain diesel fuels). however, public concerns have been raised related to its potential environmental impact. additional federal, state and local laws and regulations to more closely regulate hydraulic fracturing have been considered or implemented. legislation to further regulate hydraulic fracturing has been proposed in congress. the u.s. department of interior has announced plans to formalize obligations for disclosure of chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. the results of a pending epa investigation by a committee of the house of representatives and two recent reports by the u.s. department of energy shale gas subcommittee could lead to further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing. the epa has proposed regulations under the caa regarding certain emissions from the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and announced its intention to propose regulations by 2014 under the cwa regarding wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other gas production. in addition, some state and local authorities have considered or imposed new laws and rules related to hydraulic fracturing, including additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure obligations and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain jurisdictions or in environmentally sensitive areas. we cannot predict whether any additional federal, state or local laws or regulations will be enacted in this area and if so, what their provisions would be. if additional levels of reporting, regulation or permitting moratoria were required or imposed related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process and treat could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected. we make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. if the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions and expectations may also change, and any new capital costs incurred to comply with such changes may not be recoverable under our regulatory rate structure or our customer contracts. in addition, new environmental laws and regulations might adversely affect our products and activities, including fractionation, storage and transportation, as well as waste management and air emissions. for instance, federal and state agencies could impose additional safety requirements, any of which could affect our profitability. if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or other facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to the pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key 37 pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. the operations of our businesses might also be adversely affected by changes in government regulations or in their interpretations or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or customers. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in increased regulations being either proposed or implemented. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation or increased permitting requirements. current legal proceedings or other matters against us, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, challenges to our permits by citizen groups and similar matters, might result in adverse decisions against us. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in which we are a named defendant. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. in addition, existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws, regulations and permitting requirements might be adopted or become applicable to us, our facilities our customers, our vendors or our service providers, and future changes in laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. for example, various legislative and regulatory reforms associated with pipeline safety and integrity have been proposed recently, including the pipeline safety, regulatory certainty, and job creation act of 2011 enacted on january 3, 2012. this law will result in the promulgation of new regulations to be administered by the phmsa affecting the operations of our gas pipelines including, but not limited to, requirements relating to pipeline inspection, installation of additional valves and other equipment and records verification. these reforms and any future changes in related laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs. the 2010 drilling moratorium in the gulf of mexico and potentially more stringent regulations and permitting requirements on drilling in the gulf of mexico could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. the drilling moratorium in the gulf of mexico (in force from may to october 2010) impacted our production handling, gathering and transportation operations through production delays which reduced volumes of natural gas and oil delivered to our platform, pipeline and gathering facilities in 2010. in addition, the bureau of ocean energy management, regulation and enforcement continues to develop more stringent drilling and permitting requirements for producers in the gulf of mexico which could cause delays in production or new drilling. a significant decline or delay in production volumes in the gulf of mexico could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows through reduced production handling activities, gathering and transportation volumes, processing activities or other midstream services. 38 risks related to employees, outsourcing of noncore support activities, and technology institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility or with employees going to wpx as part of the separation of our exploration and production business might not be adequately preserved. in certain areas of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. as these employees reach retirement age, or with the loss of employees as part of the separation of our exploration and production business, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing relationships. a deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be able to conduct our business. the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to similar losses of institutional knowledge or disruptions. certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by an outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the united states. the economic and political conditions in certain countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide services to us present similar risks of business operations located outside of the united states, including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are greater than in the united states. risks related to weather, other natural phenomena and business disruption our assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. insurance may be inadequate, and in some instances, we have been unable to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms, or insurance has not been available at all. a significant disruption in operations or a significant liability for which we were not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. our customers energy needs vary with weather conditions. to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change or demand is impacted by regulations associated with climate change, customers energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes, leading either to increased investment or decreased revenues. acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport or distribute natural gas, ngls or other commodities. acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs. 39 our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions. we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies and protocols, we face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational and safety systems that operate our pipeline, plants and assets. we could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, hacktivists, or private individuals. the age, operating systems or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. we could also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access, physical location or information otherwise known as social engineering. our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations. breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions, could result in damage to our assets, safety incidents, damage to the environment, potential liability or the loss of contracts, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 72 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. any borrowings under 72 our credit facilities could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. (see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2011 and 2010. long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 thereafter(1) total fair value december 31, 2011 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion (2): fixed rate $ 352 $ $ $ 750 $ 375 $ 7,241 $ 8,718 $ 10,043 interest rate 6.0% 6.0% 6.0% 6.1% 6.2% 6.5% 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 thereafter(1) total fair value december 31, 2010 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion (2): fixed rate $ 507 $ 352 $ $ $ 750 $ 7,495 $ 9,104 $ 9,990 interest rate 6.4% 6.4% 6.3% 6.3% 6.4% 6.9% (1) includes unamortized discount and premium. (2) excludes capital leases. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of natural gas and ngls, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and energy commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts, and limited proprietary trading activities. our management of the risks associated with these market fluctuations includes maintaining a conservative capital structure and significant liquidity, as well as using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors, including changes in energy commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. (see note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements.) we measure the risk in our portfolio using a value-at-risk methodology to estimate the potential one-day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolio. value-at-risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolio. our value-at-risk model uses a monte carlo method to simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent probability that the one-day loss in fair value of the portfolio will not exceed the value at risk. the simulation method uses historical correlations and market forward prices and volatilities. in applying the value-at-risk methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical movements affect the positions or would cause any potential liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one-day holding period to execute. while a one-day holding period has historically been the industry standard, a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints. 73 we segregate our derivative contracts into trading and nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. we calculate value-at-risk separately for these two categories. contracts designated as normal purchases or sales and nonderivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk. trading our limited trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity price-risk exposure. the fair value of our trading derivatives was a net asset of less than $0.1 million at december 31, 2011. the value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was less than $0.1 million at december 31, 2011 and zero at december 31, 2010. nontrading our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the following activities: segment commodity price risk exposure williams partners natural gas purchases ngl sales midstream canada &amp; olefins ngl purchases and sales the fair value of our nontrading derivatives was a net asset of $1 million at december 31, 2011. the value-at-risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes was zero at december 31, 2011, and 2010. during the year ended december 31, 2011, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $1 million to a low of zero. certain of the derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes in 2011 were accounted for as cash flow hedges but realized during the year. of the total fair value on nontrading derivatives, cash flow hedges had a net asset value of zero as of december 31, 2011. though these contracts would be included in our value-at-risk calculation, any changes in the fair value of the effective portion of these hedge contracts would generally not be reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item affects earnings. trading policy we have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk management activities. these policies cover authority and delegation thereof in addition to control requirements, authorized commodities, and term and exposure limitations. foreign currency risk net assets of our consolidated foreign operations, whose functional currency is the local currency, are located primarily in canada were approximately $690 million and $580 million at december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. however, these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position, due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the respective functional currencies against the u.s. dollar would have changed stockholders equity by approximately $138 million at december 31, 2011. 74risk factors 25 risk factors forward-looking statements and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 certain matters contained in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. these forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates, believes, seeks, could, may, should, continues, estimates, expects, forecasts, intends, might, goals, objectives, targets, planned, potential, projects, scheduled, will, assumes, guidance, outlook, in service date, or other similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding: amounts and nature of future capital expenditures; expansion and growth of our business and operations; financial condition and liquidity; business strategy; cash flow from operations or results of operations; the levels of dividends to stockholders; seasonality of certain business components; and natural gas, natural gas liquids and olefins prices and demand. forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: whether we have sufficient cash to enable us to pay current and expected levels of dividends; availability of supplies, market demand, volatility of prices, and the availability and cost of capital; inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers); the strength and financial resources of our competitors; ability to acquire new businesses and assets and integrate those operations and assets into our existing businesses, as well as expand our facilities; development of alternative energy sources; the impact of operational and development hazards; 25 table of contents costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government regulations (including safety and environmental regulations), environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings; our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; changes in maintenance and construction costs; changes in the current geopolitical situation; our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties; risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions stemming from our debt agreements, future changes in our credit ratings and the availability and cost of credit; the amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate; risks associated with future weather conditions; acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions; and additional risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission. given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section. 26 table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. prices for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to maintain our existing businesses. our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities. price volatility can impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. any of the foregoing can also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the markets for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, olefins, oil, petroleum, and related commodities; turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions; the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks; the availability of pipeline capacity; supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; the price and quantity of foreign imports of natural gas and oil; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; volatility in the natural gas and oil markets; the overall economic environment; the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold; and the adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate change and changes in natural gas production from exploration and production areas that we serve. the long-term financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets, and the prices of natural gas. the development of the additional natural gas reserves that are essential for our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses to thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production, gathering, storage, transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems. low prices for natural gas, regulatory 27 table of contents limitations, including environmental regulations, or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development and production of additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline transportation and import and export of natural gas supplies, adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our gathering, transportation and processing facilities. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will also naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. additionally, the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. accordingly, to maintain or increase the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas transported on or gathered through our pipeline systems and cash flows associated with the gathering and transportation of natural gas, our customers must compete with others to obtain adequate supplies of natural gas. in addition, if natural gas prices in the supply basins connected to our pipeline systems are higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions, our ability to compete with other transporters may be negatively impacted on a short-term basis, as well as with respect to our long-term recontracting activities. if new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply areas, if natural gas supplies are diverted to serve other markets in which we have a limited or no presence, if development in new supply basins where we do not have significant gathering or pipeline systems reduces demand for our services, or if environmental regulators restrict new natural gas drilling, the overall volume of natural gas transported, gathered and stored on our systems would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, new lng import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transportation facilities. we may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth. a principal focus of our strategy is to capitalize on growth opportunities. our future growth will depend upon our ability to successfully identify, finance, acquire, integrate and operate projects and businesses. failure to achieve any of these factors would adversely affect our ability to achieve growth. we have recently completed, or are in the process of completing, significant growth acquisitions and construction projects and may engage in similar growth activities in the future to capture anticipated future demand for natural gas, ngl and olefins infrastructure. this demand may not ultimately materialize. as a result, our new or expanded facilities or businesses may not achieve profitability. in addition, the process of integrating newly acquired or constructed assets into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, may absorb significant management attention and may require financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development and expansion of our existing operations. acquisitions or construction projects may require substantial new capital and could result in the incurrence of indebtedness, additional liabilities and excessive costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. if we issue additional equity in connection with future growth activities, stockholders ownership interest in us may be diluted and dividends we pay to our stockholders may be reduced. further, any limitations on our access to capital, including limitations caused by illiquidity in the capital markets, may impair our ability to complete future acquisitions and construction projects on favorable terms, if at all. our acquisition attempts may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipated. we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of businesses and properties. however, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. the following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions, including any completed or future acquisitions: some of the acquired businesses or properties may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels or could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; 28 table of contents we may lose all or part of the value of our investment or be required to contribute additional capital to support businesses or properties acquired; we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or that exceed our estimates; we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures. execution of our capital projects subjects us to construction risks, increases in labor costs and materials, and other risks that may adversely affect financial results. our growth may be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines and facilities, ngl fractionation or storage facilities or olefins processing facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities. construction or expansion of these facilities is subject to various regulatory, development and operational risks, including: the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; the availability of skilled labor, equipment, and materials to complete expansion projects; potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; impediments on our ability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; the ability to construct projects within estimated costs, including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment, materials, labor or other factors beyond our control, that may be material; and the ability to access capital markets to fund construction projects. any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding, delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs. as a result, new facilities may not achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. we do not own all of the interests in the partially owned entities, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and control these assets in a manner beneficial to us. because we do not control the partially owned entities, we may have limited flexibility to control the operation of or cash distributions received from these entities. the partially owned entities organizational documents require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis; however, in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating the businesses. at december 31, 2012, our investments in the partially owned entities accounted for approximately 16 percent of our total consolidated assets. we expect that conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our partially owned entities, on the other hand, with regard to our partially owned entities governance, business and operations. if a conflict of interest arises between us and a partially owned entity, other owners may control the partially owned entity actions with respect to such matter (subject to certain limitations), which could be detrimental to our business. any future disagreements with the other co-owners of these assets could adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic or industry conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 29 table of contents holders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount identified in guidance or any dividends at all. we may not have sufficient cash flow each quarter to make dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. the actual amount of cash we dividend will depend on the following factors, some of which are beyond our control, among others: the amount of cash that wpz and our other subsidiaries and the partially owned entities distribute to us; the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which is subject to prices we obtain for our services, the prices of natural gas, ngls and olefins, and the volumes of gas we process and ngls and olefins we fractionate and store, and our operating costs; the level of capital expenditures we make; the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements; the cost of acquisitions, if any; fluctuations in our working capital needs; and our ability to borrow. our cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of wpz our partnership interest in wpz is our largest cash-generating asset. therefore, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of wpz to make distributions to its partners. a significant decline in wpz earnings and/or distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us. our industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results. we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. some of our competitors are large oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater access to supplies of natural gas and ngls than we do. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. other companies with which we compete may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. similarly, a highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. as a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, if at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow. we rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and ngls. although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts or add additional customers, each on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay distributions could be adversely affected. our ability to replace, extend, or add additional significant customer or supplier contracts on favorable terms is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to: the level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative fuel sources, such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy. 30 table of contents natural gas, ngl, and olefins prices, demand, availability and margins in our markets. higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. also, lower energy commodity prices could result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems. general economic, financial markets and industry conditions. the effects of regulation on us, our customers and contracting practices. our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which they may not be adequately insured. there are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation and storage of ngls, processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including: hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, extreme weather conditions, and other natural disasters; aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), ngls, brine or industrial chemicals; collapse or failure of storage caverns; operator error; damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment; pollution and other environmental risks; fires, explosions, craterings and blowouts; truck and rail loading and unloading; operating in a marine environment; and terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies. any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. in spite of our precautions, an event such as those described above could cause considerable harm to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers. we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. we are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business, including environmental accidents. we do not maintain insurance in the type and amount to cover all possible risks of loss. we currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $610 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate with a $2 million per occurrence deductible. this insurance covers us, our subsidiaries, and 31 table of contents certain of our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. this excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and ngl operations. although we maintain property insurance on certain physical assets that we own, lease or are responsible to insure, the policy may not cover the full replacement cost of all damaged assets or the entire amount of business interruption loss we may experience. in addition, certain perils may be excluded from coverage or be sub-limited. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. we may elect to self insure a portion of our risks. we do not insure our onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at certain locations such as river crossings and compressor stations. offshore assets are covered for property damage when loss is due to a named windstorm event but coverage for loss caused by a named windstorm is significantly sub-limited and subject to a large deductible. all of our insurance is subject to deductibles. if a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured it could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. in addition, to the insurance coverage described above, we are a member of oil insurance limited (oil), an energy industry mutual insurance company, which provides coverage for damage to our property. as an insured member of oil, we share in the losses among other oil members even if our property is not damaged. furthermore, any insurance company that provides coverage to us may experience negative developments that could impair their ability to pay any of our claims. as a result, we could be exposed to greater losses than anticipated and may have to obtain replacement insurance, if available, at a greater cost. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and our ability to repay our debt. our assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. a significant disruption in operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport or distribute natural gas, ngls or other commodities. acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions. we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies and protocols, we face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information 32 table of contents technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants and assets. we could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, hacktivists, or private individuals. the age, operating systems or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. we could also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations. breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions, could result in damage to our assets, safety incidents, damage to the environment, potential liability or the loss of contracts, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and results of operations. we could be subject to penalties and fines if we fail to comply with laws governing our businesses. our businesses are regulated by numerous governmental agencies including, but not limited to, the ferc, the epa and the phmsa. should we fail to comply with applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders, our businesses could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. for example, under the energy policy act of 2005, ferc has civil penalty authority under the natural gas act (nga) to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1,000,000 per day for each violation and under the pipeline safety, regulatory certainty, and job creation act of 2011, the phmsa has civil penalty authority up to $200,000 per day, with a maximum of $2 million for any related series of violations. any material penalties or fines under these or other statutes, rules, regulations or orders could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the natural gas sales, transportation and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return. the natural gas sales, transmission and storage operations of the gas pipelines are subject to federal, state and local regulatory authorities. specifically, their interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. the federal regulation extends to such matters as: transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce; rates, operating terms, and conditions of service, including initiation and discontinuation of service; the types of services the gas pipelines may offer their customers; certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities; acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities; accounts and records; depreciation and amortization policies; relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business; and market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas. under the nga, the ferc has authority to regulate providers of natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services in interstate commerce, and such providers may only charge rates that have been determined to 33 table of contents be just and reasonable by the ferc. in addition, the ferc prohibits providers from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business. the rates, terms and conditions for interstate gas pipeline services are set forth in ferc-approved tariffs. any successful complaint or protest against the rates of the gas pipelines could have an adverse impact on their revenues associated with providing transportation services. we are subject to risks associated with climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts and with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs) have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing our products and services, the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks. in addition, legislative and regulatory responses related to ghgs and climate change create the potential for financial risk. the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) has issued a final determination that six ghg emissions are a threat to public safety and welfare and implemented permitting for new and/or modified large sources of ghg emissions. increased public awareness and concern over climate change may result in additional state, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions. the u.s. congress and certain states have for some time been considering various forms of legislation related to ghg emissions and additional regulation of ghg emissions in our industry may be implemented under existing clean air act programs. there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of ghgs. regulatory actions by the epa or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any ghg emissions program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products and services by making our products and services less desirable than competing sources of energy. our operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities and expenditures that could exceed current expectations. substantial costs, liabilities, delays and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation and storage of ngls, processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling, as a result, we may be required to make substantial expenditures that could exceed current expectations. our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. various governmental authorities, including the epa, the u.s. department of the interior, the bureau of indian affairs and analogous state agencies and tribal governments, have the power to enforce compliance with 34 table of contents these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations and delays in granting permits. there is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our business, some of which may be material, due to our handling of the products as they are gathered, transported, processed, fractionated and stored, air emissions related to our operations, historical industry operations, waste and waste disposal practices, and the prior use of flow meters containing mercury. joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. our business may be adversely affected by changed regulations and increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from noncompliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. we make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretation of those laws and regulations. if the interpretation of the laws and regulations themselves change, our assumptions and expectations may also change and any new capital costs incurred to comply with such changes may not be recoverable under our regulatory rate structure or our customer contracts. we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operations. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation or construction of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. increased regulation of energy extraction activities, including hydraulic fracturing, could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could decrease the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process and treat. hydraulic fracturing, a practice involving the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into tight geologic formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production, is currently exempt from federal regulation pursuant to the federal safe drinking water act (except when the fracturing fluids or propping agents contain diesel fuels). however, public concerns have been raised related to its potential environmental impact and there have been recent initiatives at the federal, state and local levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing. several states have adopted regulations that impose permitting, disclosure and well-completion requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. the epa has also announced regulatory and 35 table of contents enforcement initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas extraction and production activities. we cannot predict whether any additional federal, state or local laws or regulations will be enacted in this area and if so, what their provisions would be. if new regulations are imposed related to oil and gas extraction, or if additional levels of reporting, regulation or permitting moratoria are required or imposed related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process and treat could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected. if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected. we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. the operation of our businesses might also be adversely affected by changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers. public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in increased regulations being either proposed or implemented. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations. certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters against us, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. in addition, existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us, our facilities or our customers, and future changes in laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay interest on our indebtedness. for example, various legislative and regulatory reforms associated with pipeline safety and integrity have been proposed or enacted, including the pipeline safety, regulatory certainty, and job creation act of 2011 enacted on january 3, 2012. this law will result in the promulgation of new regulations to be administered by phmsa affecting the operations of our gas pipelines including, but not limited to, requirements relating to pipeline inspection, installation of additional valves and other equipment and records verification. these reforms and any future changes in related laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs and impact our operations. in addition, the ferc or competition in our markets may not allow us to recover such costs in the rates we charge for our services. 36 table of contents certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues they collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations. we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited term. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. difficult conditions in the global capital markets, the credit markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations. our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services, increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers and a reduction in our credit ratings (either due to tighter rating standards or the negative impacts described above), which could reduce our access to credit markets, raise the cost of such access or require us to provide additional collateral to our counterparties. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. in addition, financial markets have recently been affected by concerns over u.s. fiscal policy, including uncertainty regarding federal spending and tax policy, as well as the u.s. federal government debt ceiling and the federal deficit. these concerns, as well as actions taken by the u.s. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and u.s. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manners described above. 37 table of contents a downgrade of our credit ratings could impact our liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business, and independent third parties outside of our control determine our credit ratings. a downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to post collateral with third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. our ability to access capital markets could also be limited by a downgrade of our credit ratings and other disruptions. such disruptions could include: economic downturns; deteriorating capital market conditions; declining market prices for natural gas, ngls, olefins, oil and other commodities; terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies; and the overall health of the energy industry, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies. credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. this analysis includes a number of criteria including, but not limited to, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold investments in the rated entity. ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies, and no assurance can be given that we will maintain our current credit ratings. we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and our credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk. we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including declines in our customers and counterparties creditworthiness. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off doubtful accounts. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. restrictions in our debt agreements and our leverage may affect our future financial and operating flexibility. our total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of december 31, 2012, was $10.7 billion. the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. in addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our and our material subsidiaries ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply. our debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. for example, they could: make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness; 38 table of contents impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes; adversely affect our ability to pay cash dividends to stockholders; diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt. our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and may differ materially from our current assumptions. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. in addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management discussion and analysis of financial condition and liquidity . we are not prohibited under our indentures from incurring additional indebtedness. our incurrence of significant additional indebtedness would exacerbate the negative consequences mentioned above, and could adversely affect our ability to repay our existing indebtedness. institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility or with our former employees might not be adequately preserved. in certain areas of our business, institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service. as these employees reach retirement age their services are no longer available to us, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. we might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets. our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts may consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including contracts for natural gas, ngls, olefins, and other commodities that are settled by the 39 table of contents delivery of the commodity or cash throughout the united states. if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage, it could negatively affect our results of operations. in the past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets. in certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. if such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our contracts, we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. in addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our counterparties. despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. if the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty obligation is inadequate, we will suffer a loss. downturns in the economy or disruptions in the global credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than we expect. our risk management and measurement systems and hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. the systems we use to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses might not always be followed or might not always be effective. further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used and may in the future use fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under gaap, must be recorded in our income. this creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to us has occurred during the applicable period. the impact of changes in market prices for ngls and natural gas on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging activities. these hedging arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market prices for ngls or natural gas were to change substantially from the price established by the hedges. in addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: volumes are less than expected; the hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating the risk being hedged; and the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments. 40 table of contents the adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities. in july 2010, federal legislation known as the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the dodd-frank act ) was enacted. the dodd-frank act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including oil and gas hedging transactions. among other things, the dodd-frank act provides for the creation of position limits for certain derivatives transactions, as well as requiring certain transactions to be transacted on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required. these new rules and regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts or reduce the availability of derivatives. although we believe the derivative contracts that we enter into should not be impacted by position limits and should to a large extent be exempt from the requirement to trade these transactions on exchanges and to clear these transactions through a central clearing house or to post collateral, the impact upon our businesses will depend on the outcome of the implementing regulations that are continuing to be adopted by the commodities futures trading commission. a number of our financial derivative transactions used for hedging purposes are currently executed on exchanges and cleared through clearing houses that already require the posting of margins based on initial and variation requirements. final rules promulgated under the dodd-frank act may require us to post additional cash or new margin to the clearing house or to our counterparties in connection with our hedging transactions. posting such additional cash collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our cash available for capital expenditures or other corporate purposes. a requirement to post cash collateral could therefore reduce our ability to execute hedges to reduce commodity price uncertainty and thus protect cash flows. if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the dodd-frank act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other post-retirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, williams partners l.p. as such, this subsidiary operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations. one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz, a publicly traded limited partnership. this subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to wpz as the general partner and to the limited partners of wpz. activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. our control of the general partner of wpz may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise between wpz, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material. potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosures in the future, which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance. regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial disclosures, and companies relationships with their independent public accounting firms. it remains unclear what new laws or 41 table of contents regulations will be adopted, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact that any such new laws or regulations could have. in addition, the financial accounting standards board, the sec or the ferc could enact new accounting standards or the ferc could issue rules that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. any significant change in accounting standards or disclosure requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of foreign governments. these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects. we currently own and might acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the united states. the economic, political and legal conditions and regulatory environment in the countries in which we have interests or in which we might pursue acquisition or investment opportunities present risks that are different from or greater than those in the united states. these risks include delays in construction and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, including with respect to the prices we realize for the commodities we produce and sell. the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain nonrecourse project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments. operations and investments in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and repatriation risk. in certain situations under which we develop or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert to u.s. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign currencies. in addition, risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in another. in such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service obligations. we may or may not put contracts in place designed to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. we have some exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses or volatility in our results of operations. failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the united states. service provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx energy, inc. (wpx) stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying an irs private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities. in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service (irs) and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the internal revenue code of 1986 (the code), except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in 42 table of contents addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities. the spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements that we did not assume in our agreements with wpx. the spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. a court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. under the separation and distribution agreement between us and wpx, from and after the spin-off, each of wpx and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which each owns and operates. although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to wpx, particularly if wpx were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 85 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. any borrowings under our credit facilities could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. the maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. (see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements.) 85 table of contents the tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of december 31, 2012 and 2011. long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. the fair value of our publicly traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded bond market prices. private debt is valued based on market rates and the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2012 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion (2): fixed rate $ $ $ 750 $ 375 $ 785 $ 8,449 $ 10,359 $ 12,013 interest rate 5.5 % 5.5 % 5.6 % 5.7 % 5.6 % 6.0 % variable rate $ $ $ $ 375 $ $ $ 375 $ 375 interest rate (3) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 thereafter (1) total fair value december 31, 2011 (millions) long-term debt, including current portion (2): fixed rate $ 352 $ $ $ 750 $ 375 $ 7,241 $ 8,718 $ 10,043 interest rate 6.0 % 6.0 % 6.0 % 6.1 % 6.2 % 6.5 % (1) includes unamortized discount and premium. (2) excludes capital leases. (3) the weighted average interest rate at december 31, 2012 was 2.7 percent. commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price of ngls, olefins, and natural gas, as well as other market factors, such as market volatility and energy commodity price correlations. we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related contracts, and limited proprietary trading activities. our management of the risks associated with these market fluctuations includes maintaining a conservative capital structure and significant liquidity, as well as using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to many factors, including changes in energy commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes in interest rates. (see note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements.) we measure the risk in our portfolio using a value-at-risk methodology to estimate the potential one-day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolio. value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolio. our value-at-risk model uses a monte carlo method to simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent probability that the one-day loss in fair value of the portfolio will not exceed the value at risk. the simulation method uses historical correlations and market forward prices and volatilities. in applying the value-at-risk methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical movements affect the positions or would cause any potential liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one-day holding period to execute. while a one-day holding period has historically been the industry standard, a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints. 86 table of contents we segregate our derivative contracts into trading and nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. we calculate value at risk separately for these two categories. contracts designated as normal purchases or sales and nonderivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk. trading our limited trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity price-risk exposure. at december 31, 2012, we had no trading derivatives in our portfolio. the fair value of our trading derivatives at december 31, 2011, was a net asset of less than $0.1 million. the value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was zero at december 31, 2012, and less than $0.1 million at december 31, 2011. nontrading our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from natural gas purchase and ngl purchase and sale activity. the fair value of our nontrading derivatives was a net asset of $4 million and $1 million at december 31, 2012, and 2011, respectively. the value-at-risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes was less than $0.1 million at december 31, 2012, and zero at december 31, 2011. during the year ended december 31, 2012, our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $2.3 million to a low of zero. certain of the derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes in 2012 were accounted for as cash flow hedges but realized during the year. as of december 31, 2012, the energy derivative contracts in our portfolio have not been designated as cash flow hedges. trading policy we have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk management activities. these policies cover authority and delegation thereof in addition to control requirements, authorized commodities, and term and exposure limitations. foreign currency risk net assets of our consolidated foreign operations, whose functional currency is the local currency, located primarily in canada were approximately $899 million and $779 million at december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. however, these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position, due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the u.s. dollar. as an example, a 20 percent change in the respective functional currencies against the u.s. dollar would have changed total stockholders equity by approximately $180 million at december 31, 2012. 87 table of contents
