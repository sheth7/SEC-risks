% for the year ended december 31, 2015 . durin g 2014, we incurred intercompany debt, which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. as this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in

2017 , the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our revenues and operating income to decline by approximately 1.1% and 2.8% , respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2017 . as of december 31, 2017 , we had intercompany debt, which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. as settlement of this debt is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future , any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. a change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt at december 31, 2017 would have resulted in approximately $56.4 million of unrealized gains or losses

substantial indebtedness. as indicated below, we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. as of december 31, 2005 2004 (in thousands) total indebtedness* $ 784,392 $ 925,797 shareholders equity (deficit) $ 81,431 $ (88,671 ) * excludes deferred gain on interest rate swap of $1,909 at december 31, 2004. our ability to service our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. in order to manage our substantial amount of indebtedness, we may from time to time sell assets, issue equity, or repurchase, restructure or refinance some or all of our debt (all of which we have done at various times in the last two years). we may not be able to effectuate any of these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms in the future, if at all. the implementation of any of these alternative strategies may dilute our current shareholders or subject us to additional costs or restrictions on our ability to manage our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and growth strategy. we may not have sufficient liquidity or cash flow from operations to repay our 9 3 / 4 % senior discount notes or our 8 1 / 2 % senior notes upon their respective maturities. therefore, prior to the maturity of our outstanding 8 table of contents notes we may be required to refinance and/or restructure some or all of this debt. we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance or restructure this debt on acceptable terms or at all, and, in particular, we cannot assure you that interest rates will be favorable to us at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring. if we were unable to refinance, restructure or otherwise repay the principal amount of this debt upon its maturity, we may need to sell assets, cease operations and/or file for protection under the bankruptcy laws. we may not have sufficient liquidity or cash flow from operations to repay the components of the mortgage loan that comprises part of the cmbs transaction. therefore, prior to the final repayment date for the components of the mortgage loan we may be required to refinance the mortgage loan or sell a portion or all of our interests in the 1,714 tower sites that. among other things, secure along with their operating cash flows the mortgage loan. although, the mortgage loan is a limited recourse obligation of sba properties, inc. and no holder of the mortgage loan will have recourse to sba communications, our operations would be adversely affected if sba properties is unable to repay the components of the mortgage loan. we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full. as of december 31, 2005, we had no borrowings under our $160.0 million senior credit facility of which $39.1 million was available (giving effect to leverage limitations contained in the indenture governing the 9 3 / 4 % senior discount notes) subject to maintenance covenants, borrowing base limitations and other conditions. furthermore, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline. if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates for new tenant leases decrease, we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business. this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations. our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for independently owned towers. if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. demand for our services may decline if there is significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers as they may then reduce capital expenditures in the aggregate because many of their existing networks and expansion plans overlap. as a result of regulatory changes in january 2003 which removed prior restrictions on wireless service providers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area, there have been significant consolidations of the large wireless service providers. specifically, cingular acquired at&amp;t wireless in october 2004 and sprint pcs and nextel merged to form sprint nextel corporation in august 2005. to the extent that our customers have consolidated or that other customers may consolidate in the future, they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers and/or may not lease as much space on our towers in the future. this would adversely affect our growth, our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness. 9 table of contents as of december 31, 2005, cingular and the former at&amp;t wireless both had leases on 274 of our 3,304 towers. the contractual revenue generated by these leases on these towers at december 31, 2005 was approximately $13.6 million. consequently, if cingular were not to renew duplicate leases, we could lose 50% or more of such revenue. as of december 31, 2005, the average remaining contractual life of such duplicate leases was approximately 2.9 years. our risk of revenue loss from the integration of cingular and at&amp;t is not limited to leases on the same tower. we expect cingular to terminate or not renew some leases on our towers where they have other antenna sites in close proximity. such terminations or non-renewals could have a material adverse impact on our growth rate. as of december 31, 2005, sprint nextel and affiliated entities had multiple leases on 421 of our 3,304 towers. the contractual revenue generated by these leases on these towers at december 31, 2005 was approximately $19.7 million. consequently, if sprint nextel were not to renew duplicate leases, we could lose 50% or more of such revenue. as of december 31, 2005, the average remaining contractual life of such duplicate leases was approximately 3.5 years. our risk of revenue loss from the integration of sprint nextel merger is not limited to leases on the same tower. we expect sprint nextel to terminate or not renew some leases on our towers where they have other antenna sites in close proximity. such terminations or non-renewals could have a material adverse impact on our growth rate. similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space. wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider services. wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communications sites owned or controlled by us or others. the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers, particularly in our site development services business. the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. the following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers: for the year ended december 31, 2005 2004 2003 cingular 25.5 % 22.7 % 20.3 % sprint nextel 20.8 % 21.4 % 13.5 % bechtel corporation 5.0 % 6.1 % 10.4 % 10 table of contents we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments: percentage of site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31, 2005 2004 2003 cingular 28.0 % 27.5 % 28.0 % sprint nextel 15.0 % 14.3 % 13.9 % verizon 10.1 % 9.5 % 10.0 % percentage of site development consulting revenue for the year ended december 31, 2005 2004 2003 verizon wireless 32.4 % 26.1 % 13.6 % cingular 28.3 % 26.6 % 4.3 % bechtel corporation* 23.3 % 24.7 % 40.3 % percentage of site development construction revenue for the year ended december 31, 2005 2004 2003 sprint nextel 34.9 % 39.2 % 15.3 % cingular 20.3 % 12.5 % 5.5 % bechtel corporation* 11.6 % 14.5 % 28.9 % * substantially all of the work performed for bechtel corporation was for its client cingular. revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts. each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five five-year periods at the option of the tenant. our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. in addition, a customer need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. furthermore, our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects. our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan. our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan. for example, it could: limit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and development costs; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; subject us to interest rate risk in connection with any potential future refinancing of our debt; place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are less leveraged; 11 table of contents require us to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. risks associated with our plans to increase our tower portfolio could negatively impact our results of operations or our financial condition. we currently intend to increase our tower portfolio through new builds and acquisitions. we intend to review all available acquisition opportunities (including some that are currently available) and some of these acquisitions could have the effect of materially increasing our tower portfolio. while we intend to fund a portion of the cash required to implement this plan from our cash flow from operating activities, we may finance some or all of the costs associated with these new builds and acquisitions. furthermore, if we were to consummate any significant acquisition, we would be required to finance these acquisitions through additional indebtedness, which would increase our indebtedness and interest expense and could increase our leverage ratio, and/or issuances of equity, which could be dilutive to our shareholders. if we were unable to recognize the expected returns from these new towers, or if we did not recognize the expected returns in our anticipated time frames, the increase in debt levels without a proportionate increase in our revenues could negatively impact our results of operations and our financial condition. due to the long-term expectation of revenue from our tenant leases, we are dependent on the financial strength and creditworthiness of our customers. due to the long-term nature of our tenant leases, we, like others in the tower industry, are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants. the economic slowdown and intense competition in the wireless and telecommunications industries in 2001 through 2003 had impaired the financial condition of some of our customers, certain of which operate with substantial leverage. as a result, a number of our site leasing customers have filed for bankruptcy including almost all of our paging customers. although these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues, any future bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, and/or the collectability of our accounts receivable. in the future, the financial uncertainties facing our customers could reduce demand for our communications sites, increase our bad debt expense and reduce prices on new customer contracts. this could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations. in addition, our anticipated growth could be negatively impacted if our customers access to debt and equity capital were limited. from 2001 through 2003, when capital market conditions were difficult for the telecommunications industry, wireless service providers conserved capital by not spending as much as originally anticipated to finance expansion activities. this decrease adversely impacted demand for our services and consequently our financial condition. if our customers are not able to access the capital markets in the future, our growth strategy, revenues and financial condition may again be adversely affected. our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business. our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes each contain certain restrictive covenants. among other things, these covenants limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; sell assets; pay dividends, or repurchase our common stock; make certain investments; engage in other restricted payments; engage in mergers or consolidations; incur liens; and enter into affiliate transactions. if we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments. the acceleration of amounts due under one of our debt instruments would also cause a cross-default under our other debt instruments. sba senior finance ii llc ( senior finance ii ), which owns, directly or indirectly, all of the common stock and membership interests of the majority of our operating subsidiaries, is the borrower under our senior credit facility. the senior credit facility requires senior finance ii to maintain specified financial ratios, including ratios regarding senior finance ii debt to annualized operating cash flow, cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter. in addition, the senior credit facility contains additional negative covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to commit to capital expenditures and build or acquire towers without anchor or acceptable tenants. our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests and comply with these covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to do so. a breach of any of these covenants, if not remedied within the specified period, could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility. 12 table of contents upon the occurrence of any default, our senior credit facility lenders can prevent us from borrowing any additional amounts under the senior credit facility. in addition, upon the occurrence of any event of default, other than certain bankruptcy events, senior credit facility lenders, by a majority vote, can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under the senior credit facility, together with all accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. the acceleration of amounts due under our senior credit facility would cause a cross-default under our indentures, thereby permitting the acceleration of such indebtedness. if the indebtedness under the senior credit facility and/or indebtedness under our outstanding notes were to be accelerated, our current assets would not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness. if we were unable to repay amounts that become due under the senior credit facility, the senior credit facility lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility are secured by a first lien on substantially all of senior finance ii assets and are guaranteed by sba communications and certain of its subsidiaries. in such an event of default, our assets may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes. our $405.0 million mortgage loan relating to our cmbs certificates contains a covenant requiring all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents be deposited into a reserve account if the debt service coverage ratio falls to 1.30 times or lower, as of the end of any calendar quarter. debt service coverage ratio is defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that sba properties, inc. will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months. if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15 times as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an amortization period will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan. the funds in the reserve account will not be released to sba properties unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30 times for two consecutive calendar quarters. failure to maintain the debt service coverage ratio above 1.30 times would impact our ability to pay our indebtedness other than the mortgage loan and to operate our business. the mortgage loan provides for customary remedies if an event of default occurs including foreclosure against all or part of the property pledged as security for the mortgage loan. the mortgage loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 1,714 collateralized tower sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of sba properties personal property and fixtures and (3) sba properties rights under the management agreement with sba network management, inc. (who manages all of sba properties sites). we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full. our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore should not be considered indicative of our long-term results. the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered as indicative of long-term results. numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including: the timing and amount of our customers capital expenditures; the size and scope of our projects; the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers fiscal year; delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment; seasonal factors, such as weather, vacation days and total business days in a quarter; the use of third party providers by our customers; the rate and volume of wireless service providers network development; and general economic conditions. 13 table of contents although the demand for our site development services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts. in addition, the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long. therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in a timely basis to accommodate market slowdowns. we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses. we are not profitable. the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated: for the year ended december 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) net loss $ (94,709 ) $ (147,280 ) $ (175,148 ) our losses are principally due to significant interest expense and depreciation and amortization in each of the periods presented above. for the year ended december 31, 2005, we recorded asset impairment charges of $0.4 million and a charge associated with the write-off of deferred financing fees and loss on the extinguishment of debt of $29.3 million. for the year ended december 31, 2004, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $7.1 million and a charge associated with the write-off of deferred financing fees and loss on the extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million. we recorded an asset impairment charge of $13.0 million, a charge associated with the loss from write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt of $24.2 million, and a restructuring charge of $2.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2003. we expect to continue to incur significant losses which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness. increasing competition in the tower industry may adversely affect us. our industry is highly competitive. competitive pressures for tenants from our competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income. in addition, the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers would lead to an accompanying adverse effect on our revenues, margins and financial condition. increasing competition could also make the acquisition of quality tower assets more costly, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement and/or maintain our tower acquisition program. in the site leasing business, we compete with: wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers; other large independent tower companies; and smaller local independent tower operators. wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks and several of the other tower companies generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do. we believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and, to a lesser extent, price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. the site development services segment of our industry is also extremely competitive. there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business. as a result of this competition, margins in this segment have decreased over the past few years. many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we 14 table of contents consider unprofitable. if margins in this segment were to further decrease, our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected. we may not be able to build and/or acquire as many towers as we anticipate. we currently intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2006 and to consummate a number of tower acquisitions. however, our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction, our ability to locate, and acquire at commercially reasonable prices, attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits. our ability to consummate tower acquisitions is also subject to risks. specifically, these risks include (1) sufficient capital to fund such acquisitions, (2) our ability to identify those towers that would be attractive to our clients and accretive to our financial results, and (3) our ability to negotiate and consummate agreements to acquire such towers. due to these risks, it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated, the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2006. if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals. the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business. our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel. we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel. we have employment agreements with jeffrey a. stoops, our president and chief executive officer, kurt l. bagwell, our senior vice president and chief operating officer, and thomas p. hunt, our senior vice president and general counsel. we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel. if we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. new technologies and their use by wireless service providers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations. the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers. for example, the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space. additionally, the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity, such as beam forming or smart antennae, that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space. the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require ground-based sites, such as the growth in delivery of video, voice and data services by satellites or other technologies, could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space. in addition, the deployment of wifi and wimax technologies could impact the network needs of our existing customers providing wireless telephony services. this could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations. delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies as well as lower consumer demand and slower consumer adoption rates than anticipated may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate. there can be no assurances that 3g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated. the deployment of 3g has already experienced significant delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries. additionally, the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated. these factors could have a material 15 table of contents adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated. our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency ( rf ) energy. the government imposes requirements and other guidelines on our towers relating to rf energy. exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects. the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. according to the fcc, the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive. however, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. in particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services. moreover, if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. if we were subject to claims relating to rf energy, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business. we are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business. in particular, both the fcc and faa regulate the construction and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas. in addition, the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures. faa and fcc regulations govern construction, lighting, painting and marking of towers and structures and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure, require registration of the tower or structure. certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa standards and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages. certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements. failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply. in addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth. local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification. local regulations can delay, prevent, or increase the cost of new construction, co-locations, or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. in addition, new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations. our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters. our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes and hurricanes. we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. we also maintain third party liability insurance, subject to deductibles, to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. a tower accident for which we are uninsured or 16 table of contents underinsured, or damage to a significant number of our towers, could require us to make significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes. as owner, lessee or operator of numerous tower sites, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. however, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business. we are a holding company with no business operations of our own. our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries. we conduct, and expect to conduct, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations, including the principal and interest, premium, if any, and additional interest, if any, on our outstanding 9 3 / 4 % senior discount notes and our 8 1 / 2 % senior notes, is dependent upon dividends and other distribution from our subsidiaries to us. additionally, sba properties as the borrower under the cmbs transaction must repay the components of the mortgage loan thereto. if sba properties cash flow is insufficient to cover such repayments, we may be required to refinance the mortgage loan or sell a portion or all of our interests in the 1,714 tower sites that among other things, secure along with their operating cash flows the mortgage loan. other than the amounts required to make interest and principal payments on the notes and repayment of amounts under the cmbs transaction, we currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing their debt obligations. our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise to pay the principal, interest and other amounts on the notes, or repay the components of the mortgage loan pursuant to the cmbs transaction (other than sba properties, as the borrower, and sba cmbs-1 guarantor llc and cmbs-1 holdings, llc, as guarantors), or make any funds available to us for payment. the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us may be restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the terms of the senior credit facility and the cmbs certificates. although the indentures governing the notes will limit the ability of our operating subsidiaries to enter into consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us, these limitations are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business. we are subject to interest rate risk on our senior credit facility and any future financing requirements. we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate senior notes and our borrowings under our senior credit facility. as of december 31, 2005, long-term fixed rate borrowings represented 100% of our total borrowings. the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and interest rates associated with our long-term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness as of december 31, 2005: expected maturity date 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 thereafter total fair value (in thousands) long-term debt: fixed rate cmbs

162,500 $ 162,500 $ 181,188 (1) the amount included for the 9 3 / 4 % senior discount notes represents the accreted value of the notes at their maturity date. as of december 31, 2005, these notes had an accreted value of $216.9 million and a fair value of $243.7 million. our primary market risk exposure relates to (1) our ability to refinance our 9 3 / 4 % senior discount notes, our 8 1 / 2 % senior notes, and cmbs certificates at their expected repayment dates or at maturity at market rates, and (2) the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet financial covenants. we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding long-term and short-term debt through our use of fixed and variable rate debt. while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis. senior note and senior discount note disclosure requirements the indentures governing our 8 1 / 2 % senior notes and our 9 3 / 4 % senior discount notes require certain financial disclosures for restricted subsidiaries separate from unrestricted subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2005, we had no unrestricted subsidiaries. additionally, we are required to disclose (i) tower cash flow, as defined in the indentures, for the most recent fiscal quarter and (ii) adjusted consolidated cash flow, as defined in the 38 table of contents indentures, for the most recently completed four-quarter period. this information is presented solely as a requirement of the indentures. such information is not intended as an alternative measure of financial position, operating results or cash flows from operations (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). furthermore, our measure of the following information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. tower cash flow and adjusted consolidated cash flow, as defined in our senior notes and senior discount note indentures, are as follows: 9 3 / 4 % senior discount notes (in thousands) holdco tower cash flow for the three months ended december 31,

27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements concern expectations, beliefs, projections, plans, and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. specifically, this annual report contains forward-looking statements regarding: our estimates regarding our liquidity, capital expenditures and sources of both, and our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due; our belief that we will experience continued long-term growth of our site leasing revenues due to increasing minutes of use and network coverage and capacity requirements; our strategy to focus our business on the site leasing business, and the consequential shift in our revenue stream and gross profits from project driven revenues to recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal capital expenditures; our belief that focusing our site leasing activities in the eastern third of the united states will improve our operating efficiencies, reduce overhead expenses and procure higher revenue per tower; our expectation of growing our cash flows by using existing tower capacity or requiring carriers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications; 39 table of contents our belief that our towers have significant capacity to accommodate additional tenants and increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost; our intention to selectively invest in new tower builds and/or tower acquisitions and to fund such new tower builds and/or acquisitions in part from our cash flow from operating activities; our intent to purchase the land that underlies our towers if available at commercially reasonable prices; our expectations regarding our new build program and our intent to build 80 - 100 new towers in 2006; our intent that substantially all of our new builds will at least have one tenant upon completion and our expectation that some will have multiple tenants; our belief regarding our position to capture additional site leasing business in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets; our estimates regarding our annual debt service and cash interest requirements in 2006 and thereafter; and our estimates regarding cash savings in debt service and amortization payments in 2006 as a result of our debt refinancing activities and our intent to continue to reduce our interest expense. these forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. we wish to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. the most important factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals, and cause the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: our inability to sufficiently increase our revenues and maintain or decrease expenses and cash capital expenditures to permit us to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due; our ability to further reduce our interest expense; the inability of our clients to access sufficient capital or their unwillingness to expend capital to fund network expansion or enhancements; our ability to continue to comply with covenants and the terms of our senior credit facility and to access sufficient capital to fund our operations; our ability to secure as many site leasing tenants as planned; our ability to expand our site leasing business and maintain or expand our site development business; our ability to successfully build 80 - 100 new towers in 2006; our ability to successfully implement our strategy of having at least one tenant on each new build upon completion; our ability to successfully address zoning issues; our ability to retain current lessees on our towers; our ability to realize economies of scale from our tower portfolio; and the continued use of towers and dependence on outsourced site development services by the wireless communications industry. we assume no responsibility for updating forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k. 40 table of contents non-gaap financial measures this report contains certain non-gaap measures, including adjusted ebitda and segment operating profit information. we have provided below a description of such non-gaap measures, a reconcilement of such non-gaap measures to their most comparable gaap measures, an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures, their respective limitations and how management compensates for such limitations. adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as loss from continuing operations plus net interest expenses, provision for income taxes, depreciation, accretion and amortization, asset impairment charges, non-cash compensation, restructuring and other charges, and other expenses and excluding non-cash leasing revenue and non-cash ground lease expense. we have included this non-gaap financial measure because we believe this item is an indicator of the profitability and performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results. in addition, adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with some of our debt instruments, particularly our senior credit facility. adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income as determined in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measurements of adjusted ebitda and the adjusted ebitda margin have certain material limitations, including: they do not include interest expense. because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits and cash flows. therefore any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations; they do not include depreciation and amortization expense. because we use capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits. therefore any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense has material limitations; they do not include provision for income taxes. because the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our costs, particularly in the future, any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations; and they do not include non-cash expenses such as asset impairment charges, non-cash compensation, restructuring and other charges, other expenses, non-cash leasing revenue and non-cash ground lease expense. because these non-cash items are a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate profits, any measure that excludes these non-cash items has material limitations. we compensate for these limitations by using adjusted ebitda and the adjusted ebitda margin as only two of several comparative tools, together with gaap measurements, to assist in the evaluation of our profitability and operating results. 41 table of contents for the year ended december 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) loss from continuing operations $ (94,648 ) $ (144,023 ) $ (174,805 ) add back (deduct): interest

less segment cost of revenues (excluding depreciation, accretion and amortization). total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the two segments. segment operating profit is, in our opinion, an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment, while excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization. segment operating profit is not intended to be alternative measures of revenue or operating income as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 42 table of contents site leasing segment for the year ended december 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) segment revenue $ 161,277 $ 144,004 $

segment operating profit has certain material limitations. specifically this measurement does not include depreciation, accretion, and amortization expense. because depreciation, accretion, and amortization expense is required by gaap as it is deemed to reflect additional operating expenses relating to our site leasing and site development segments, any measure that excludes these items has material limitations. we compensate for these limitations by using segment operating profit as only one of several comparative tools, together with gaap measurements, to assist in the evaluation of the cash generation of our segment operations.risk factors 11 risk factors risks related to our business we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline. if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease, we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business. this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations. our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for independently owned towers. if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. demand for our services may decline if there is significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers as they may then reduce capital expenditures in the aggregate because many of their existing networks and expansion plans overlap. as a result of regulatory changes in january 2003 which removed prior restrictions on wireless service providers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area, there have been significant consolidations of the large wireless service providers. specifically, cingular acquired at&amp;t wireless in october 2004 and sprint pcs and nextel merged to form sprint nextel corporation in august 2005. to the extent that our customers have consolidated or that other customers may consolidate in the future, they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers and/or may not lease as much space on our towers in the future. this would adversely affect our growth, our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness. as of december 31, 2006, cingular and the former at&amp;t wireless both had leases on an aggregate of 290 of the 5,551 towers that we owned on such date. the annualized contractual revenue generated by these leases at december 31, 2006 was approximately $14.9 million. consequently, if cingular were not to renew duplicate leases, we could lose 50% or more of such revenue. as of december 31, 2006, the average remaining contractual life of such duplicate leases was approximately 2.9 years. our risk of revenue loss from the integration of cingular and at&amp;t wireless is not limited to leases on the same tower. we expect cingular (now at&amp;t) to terminate or not renew some leases on our towers where they have other antenna sites in close proximity. during the second half of 2006, we began experiencing some decommissioning of antennae sites and non-renewal of leases from the cingular and at&amp;t wireless acquisition. cingular terminated lease agreements during 2006 with total annualized revenue of $1.5 million. in addition, we have received termination or non-renewal notices for leases expiring in the twenty-four months after december 31, 2006 with total annualized revenue of $4.4 million. in addition, we have received notifications from cingular that it expects to non-renew other leases with lease terms expiring in three or more years and we may receive additional notifications in the future. such terminations or non-renewals could have a material adverse impact on our growth rate. as of december 31, 2006, sprint nextel and affiliated entities had multiple leases on 555 of the 5,551 towers that we owned on such date. the annualized contractual revenue generated by these leases at december 31, 2006 was approximately $27.1 million. during the second half of 2006, sprint nextel extended by seven years the term of each duplicate lease. consequently, as of december 31, 2006, the average remaining contractual life of such duplicate leases was approximately 9.6 years. however, our risk of revenue loss from the integration of sprint and nextel is not limited to leases on the same tower. sprint nextel could terminate or not renew some leases on our towers where they have other antenna sites in close proximity. furthermore at the end of such lease extensions, sprint nextel may terminate the duplicate leases. such terminations or non-renewals could have a material adverse impact on our growth rate. similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space. wireless voice service providers frequently 11 table of contents enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider services. wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communications sites owned or controlled by us or others. the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations. the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers. for example, the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space. additionally, the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity, such as beam forming or smart antennae, that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space. the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require ground-based sites, such as the growth in delivery of video, voice and data services by satellites or other technologies, could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space. in addition, the deployment of wifi and wimax technologies could impact the network needs of our existing customers providing wireless telephony services. this could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations. we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers, particularly in our site development services business. the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. the following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers: percentage of total leasing revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 sprint nextel 27.6 % 30.9 % 31.0 % cingular (now at&amp;t) 21.4 % 25.5 % 22.7 % we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments: percentage of site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 cingular (now at&amp;t) 26.7 % 28.0 % 27.5 % sprint nextel 26.2 % 30.7 % 29.4 % verizon 9.7 % 10.1 % 9.5 % 12 table of contents percentage of site development consulting revenue for the year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 sprint nextel 38.0 % 1.9 % 2.6 % verizon wireless 26.6 % 32.4 % 26.1 % bechtel corporation* 10.0 % 23.3 % 24.7 % cingular (now at&amp;t) 6.8 % 28.3 % 26.7 % percentage of site development construction revenue for the year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 sprint nextel 30.0 % 36.0 % 39.7 % bechtel corporation* 17.4 % 11.6 % 14.5 % cingular (now at&amp;t) 6.9 % 20.3 % 12.5 % * substantially all of the work performed for bechtel corporation was for its client cingular (now at&amp;t). revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts. each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five five-year periods at the option of the tenant. our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. in addition, a customer need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. furthermore, our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects. we may not be able to service our substantial indebtedness. as indicated below, we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. as of december 31, 2006 2005 (in thousands) total indebtedness $ 1,555,000 $ 784,392 shareholders equity $ 385,921 $ 81,431 as of december 31, 2006, we had approximately $1.6 billion in indebtedness, all of which is secured in the cmbs market. in addition, we have the ability to borrow additional amounts under our senior revolving credit facility and may incur additional indebtedness through other debt instruments. our ability to service our current and future debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. in order to manage our substantial amount of indebtedness, we may from time to time sell assets, issue equity, restructure or refinance some or all of our debt (all of which we have done at various times in the last four years). we may not be able to effectuate any of these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms in the future, if at all. the implementation of any of these alternative strategies may dilute our current shareholders or subject us to additional costs or restrictions on our ability to manage our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and growth strategy. we may not have sufficient liquidity or cash flow from operations to repay the cmbs certificates. the amounts borrowed under the mortgage loan in connection with the initial cmbs certificates have an anticipated repayment date of november 2010 and a final repayment date of november 2035 while the amounts borrowed under the mortgage loan in connection with the additional cmbs certificates have an anticipated repayment date of november 2011 and a final repayment date of november 2036. however, if we do not repay the full amount of each mortgage loan component before its respective anticipated repayment date, the interest rate payable on such mortgage loan outstanding will significantly increase in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan. we may not be able to service these higher interests costs if we cannot refinance the amounts outstanding under the mortgage loan before their anticipated repayment dates. furthermore, if we cannot refinance these amounts prior to the final repayment date, we may be required to sell a portion or all of our interests in the 4,975 tower sites that, among other things, secure along with their operating cash flows the mortgage loan. although, the mortgage loan is a limited recourse obligation of sba properties, inc., sba sites, inc., sba structures, inc., sba towers, inc., sba towers puerto rico, inc. and sba towers usvi, inc. (collectively, the borrowers ) and no holder of the mortgage loan will have recourse to sba communications, our operations would be adversely affected if the borrowers are unable to repay the components of the mortgage loan. we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full. we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan. our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan. for example, it could: limit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and development costs; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; subject us to interest rate risk in connection with any potential future refinancing of our cmbs certificates; place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are less leveraged; require us to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. 13 table of contents risks associated with our plans to increase our tower portfolio could negatively impact our results of operations or our financial condition. we currently intend to increase our tower portfolio through new builds and acquisitions. we intend to review all available acquisition opportunities and some of these acquisitions could have the effect of materially increasing our tower portfolio. while we intend to fund a portion of the cash required to implement this plan from our cash flow from operating activities, we may finance some or all of the costs associated with these new builds and acquisitions. furthermore, if we were to consummate any significant acquisition, we would be required to finance these acquisitions through additional indebtedness, which would increase our indebtedness and interest expense and could increase our leverage ratio, and/or issuances of equity, which could be dilutive to our shareholders. if we were unable to recognize the expected returns from these new towers, or if we did not recognize the expected returns in our anticipated time frames, an increase in debt levels without a proportionate increase in our revenues could negatively impact our results of operations and our financial condition. due to the long-term nature of our tenant leases, we are dependent on the financial strength and creditworthiness of our customers. due to the long-term nature of our tenant leases, we, like others in the tower industry, are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants. the economic slowdown and intense competition in the wireless and telecommunications industries in 2001 through 2003 had impaired the financial condition of some of our customers, certain of which operate with substantial leverage. as a result, a number of our site leasing customers have filed for bankruptcy including almost all of our paging customers. although these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues, any future bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, and/or the collectability of our accounts receivable. in the future, the financial uncertainties facing our customers could reduce demand for our communications sites, increase our bad debt expense and reduce prices on new customer contracts. this could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations. in addition, our anticipated growth could be negatively impacted if our customers access to debt and equity capital were limited. from 2001 through 2003, when capital market conditions were difficult for the telecommunications industry, wireless service providers conserved capital by not spending as much as originally anticipated to finance expansion activities. this decrease adversely impacted demand for our services and consequently our financial condition. if our customers are not able to access the capital markets in the future, our growth strategy, revenues and financial condition may again be adversely affected. our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business. our senior revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants. among other things, these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness; engage in mergers and acquisitions or sell all or substantially all of their assets; pay dividends, repurchase capital stock or engage in other restricted payments; make certain investments; make certain capital expenditures; incur liens; and enter into affiliate transactions. if our subsidiaries fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under our senior revolving credit facility. additionally, under our senior revolving credit facility, sba senior finance ii, llc ( senior finance ii ) which owns, directly or indirectly, all of the common stock and membership interests of certain of our operating subsidiaries and is the borrower under our senior revolving credit facility, is required to maintain specified financial ratios, including ratios regarding senior finance ii debt to annualized operating cash flow, cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter. in addition, the senior revolving credit facility contains additional negative covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to commit to capital expenditures and build or acquire towers without anchor or acceptable tenants. our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests and comply with these covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to do so. 14 table of contents a breach of any of these covenants, if not remedied within the specified period, could result in an event of default. amounts borrowed under the senior revolving credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of senior finance ii assets and are guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries. upon the occurrence of any default, our senior revolving credit facility lenders can prevent us from borrowing any additional amounts under the senior revolving credit facility. in addition, upon the occurrence of any event of default, other than certain bankruptcy events, the lenders under our senior revolving credit facility, by a majority vote, can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under such facility, together with all accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. if we were unable to repay amounts that become due under the senior revolving credit facility, such lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. our mortgage loan relating to our cmbs certificates contains a covenant requiring that all of the borrowers cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the loan documents be deposited into a reserve account if the debt service coverage ratio is less than 1.30 times, as of the end of any calendar quarter. the mortgage loan defines debt service coverage ratio as the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months. if the debt service coverage ratio is less than 1.15 times as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an amortization period will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan. if the debt service coverage ratio is less than 1.30 times, then the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers until the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30 times for two consecutive calendar quarters. as significantly all of our cash flow is generated by the borrowers, failure to maintain the debt service coverage ratio above 1.30 times would impact our ability to pay our indebtedness, other than the mortgage loan, and to operate our business. the mortgage loan provides for customary remedies if an event of default occurs including foreclosure against all or part of the property pledged as security for the mortgage loan. the mortgage loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the borrowers tower sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the borrowers personal property and fixtures and (3) the borrowers rights under the management agreement they entered into with sba network management, inc. ( sba network management ) relating to the management of the borrowers tower sites by sba network management pursuant to which sba network management arranges for the payment of all operating expenses and the funding of all capital expenditures out of amounts on deposit in one or more operating accounts maintained on the borrowers behalf. we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full. our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations. the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered as indicative of long-term results. numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including: the timing and amount of our customers capital expenditures; the size and scope of our projects; the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers fiscal year; delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment; seasonal factors, such as weather, vacation days and total business days in a quarter; the use of third party providers by our customers; 15 table of contents the rate and volume of wireless service providers network development; and general economic conditions. although the demand for our site development services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts. in addition, the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long. therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services. we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses. we are not profitable. the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated: for the year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) net loss $ (133,448 ) $ (94,709 ) $ (147,280 ) our losses are principally due to significant interest expense, depreciation, amortization, and accretion expenses and losses from the write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt in the periods presented above. for the year ended december 31, 2006, we had interest expense, non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees of $99.7 million, depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense of $133.1 million, and losses from the write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt of $57.2 million in connection with the extinguishment of our outstanding 9 3 / 4 % senior discount notes, our outstanding 8 1 / 2 % senior notes, and our $1.1 billion bridge loan. for the year ended december 31, 2005, we had interest expense, non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees of $69.6 million, depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense of $87.2 million, and losses from the write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt of $29.3 million in connection with the extinguishment of a portion of our outstanding 9 3 / 4 % senior discount notes, a portion of our outstanding 8 1 / 2 % senior notes, our remaining outstanding 10 1 / 4 % senior notes, and our prior credit facility. for the year ended december 31, 2004, we had interest expense, non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees of $79.0 million, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $90.5 million, and losses from the write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt of $41.2 million in connection with the retirement of our outstanding 12% senior discount notes, a portion of our 10 1 / 4 % senior notes, and the termination of another prior credit facility. we expect to continue to incur significant losses, which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness. increasing competition in the tower industry may adversely affect us. our industry is highly competitive. competitive pressures for tenants from our competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income. in addition, the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers would lead to an accompanying adverse effect on our revenues, margins and financial condition. increasing competition could also make the acquisition of quality tower assets more costly, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement and/or maintain our tower acquisition program. in the site leasing business, we compete with: wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers; other large independent tower companies; and smaller local independent tower operators. there has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past three years. specifically, american tower corporation completed its merger with spectrasite, inc. in 2005, we completed our acquisition of aat in 2006 and 16 table of contents crown castle international completed its merger with global signal, inc. in 2007. as a result of these consolidations, american tower and crown castle are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us. this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers. wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do. we believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and, to a lesser extent, price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. the site development services segment of our industry is also extremely competitive. there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business. as a result of this competition, margins in this segment have decreased over the past few years. many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable. if margins in this segment were to further decrease, our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected. we may not be able to build and/or acquire as many towers as we anticipate. we currently intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2007 and to consummate a number of tower acquisitions. however, our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction, our ability to locate, and acquire at commercially reasonable prices, attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits. our ability to consummate tower acquisitions is also subject to risks. specifically, these risks include (1) sufficient cash flow from operations or our ability to use debt or equity to fund such acquisitions, (2) our ability to identify those towers that would be attractive to our clients and accretive to our financial results, and (3) our ability to negotiate and consummate agreements to acquire such towers. due to these risks, it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated, the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2007. if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals. the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business. our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel. we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel. we have employment agreements with jeffrey a. stoops, our president and chief executive officer, kurt l. bagwell, our senior vice president and chief operating officer, thomas p. hunt, our senior vice president and general counsel and anthony j. macaione, our senior vice president and chief financial officer. we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel. if we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies as well as lower consumer demand and slower consumer adoption rates than anticipated may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate. there can be no assurances that 3g, 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated. the deployment of 3g has already experienced significant delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries. the announcement of 4g is relatively new and its deployment schedule has not been determined as of yet. additionally, the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated. 17 table of contents our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency ( rf ) energy. the government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to rf energy. exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. according to the federal communications commission (the fcc ), the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive. however, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. in particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services. moreover, if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. if we were subject to claims relating to rf energy, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business. we are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business. in particular, both the federal aviation administration ( faa ) and fcc regulate the construction and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas. in addition, the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures. faa and fcc regulations govern construction, lighting, painting and marking of towers and structures and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure, require registration of the tower or structure. certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages. certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements. failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply. in addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth. local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification. local regulations can delay, prevent, or increase the cost of new construction, co-locations, or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. in addition, new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations. our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters. our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes and hurricanes. we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. we also maintain third party liability insurance, subject to loss limits and deductibles, to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured, or damage to a significant number of our towers, could require us to make significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. 18 table of contents we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes. as owner, lessee or operator of numerous tower sites, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. however, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business. we are a holding company with no business operations of our own. our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. we conduct, and expect to conduct, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us. additionally, the borrowers under the cmbs transaction must repay the components of the mortgage loan thereto. if the borrowers cash flow is insufficient to cover such repayments, we may be required to refinance the mortgage loan or sell a portion or all of our interests in the 4,975 tower sites that among other things, secure, along with their operating cash flows, the mortgage loan. other than the amounts required to make repayment of amounts under the cmbs transaction, we currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing their debt obligations. our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise to repay the components of the mortgage loan pursuant to the cmbs transaction (other than the borrowers and sba cmbs-1 guarantor llc and cmbs-1 holdings, llc, as guarantors), or make any funds available to us for payment. the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us may be restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the terms of the senior revolving credit facility and the cmbs certificates. we have adopted anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. we adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes. these provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future. the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986. we may also have a future ownership change, outside of our control, caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders. depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change, an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income. currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized. 19 table of contents the market price of our class a common stock could be affected by significant volatility. the market price of our class a common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations. the market price of our class a common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed elsewhere in risk factors and in forward-looking statements. volatility or depressed market prices of our class a common stock could make it difficult for shareholders to resell their shares of class a common stock, when they want or at attractive prices. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 42 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business. we are subject to interest rate risk on our senior credit facility and any future financing requirements. we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term debt and our borrowings under our senior credit facility. as of december 31, 2006, long-term fixed rate borrowings represented 100% of our total borrowings. the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and interest rates associated with our long-term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness as of december 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 thereafter total fair value (in thousands) long-term debt: fixed rate cmbs certificates (1) $ 405,000 $ 1,150,000 $ $ 1,555,000 $ 1,560,103 (1) the anticipated repayment date for the cmbs certificates is november 2010 for the $405,000 of initial cmbs certificates and november 2011 for the $1,150,000 additional cmbs certificates. our current primary market risk exposure relates to (1) the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to refinance the cmbs certificates at their expected repayment dates or at maturity at market rates, and (2) our ability to meet financial covenants. we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our use of fixed and variable rate debt and interest rate hedging arrangements. while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis.

operations are highly scalable and that we can add tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs; our belief regarding our position to capture additional site leasing business in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets; expectations regarding the quality of our assets, our ability to capitalize on our asset quality and the recurring nature of revenue streams from our site leasing business; our expectations regarding our liquidity, capital expenditures and sources of both, our leverage ratios and our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due; our expectations regarding our cash capital expenditures in 2007 for maintenance and augmentation and for new tower builds, tower acquisitions and ground lease purchases and our ability to fund such cash capital expenditures; our intent to build approximately 80 to 100 new towers in 2007; 42 table of contents our intent that substantially all of our new builds will have at least one tenant upon completion and our expectation that some will have multiple tenants; our intent to pursue tower acquisitions that meet or exceed our internal guidelines, our expectations regarding the number of towers that we will be able to acquire in 2007, the amount and type of consideration that will be paid in consideration and our projections regarding the financial impact of such acquisitions; our intent to purchase and/or enter into long-term leases for the land that underlies our towers if available at commercially reasonable prices and the effect of such ground lease purchases on our margins and long-term financial condition; our estimates regarding our annual debt service in 2007 and thereafter; our expectation that any potential tax implications relating to the stock option grants will not have a material impact on our financial position; and our estimates regarding certain accounting and tax matters, including the adoption of certain accounting pronouncements and the availability of sufficient net operating losses to offset future taxable income. these forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. we wish to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. the most important factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals, and cause the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: our ability to sufficiently increase our revenues and maintain or decrease expenses and cash capital expenditures to permit us to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due; the ability of our clients to access sufficient capital or their willingness to expend capital to fund network expansion or enhancements; our ability to continue to comply with covenants and the terms of our revolving credit facility and our mortgage loan which supports our cmbs certificates; our ability to secure as many site leasing tenants as planned, including our ability to retain current leases on towers and deal with the impact, if any, of recent consolidation among wireless service providers; our ability to secure and deliver anticipated services business at contemplated margins; 43 table of contents our ability to successfully implement our strategy of generally having at least one tenant on each new build upon completion; our ability to successfully address zoning issues, permitting and other issues that arise in connection with the building of new towers; our ability to realize economies of scale from our tower portfolio; the business climate for the wireless communications industry in general and wireless communications infrastructure providers in particular; the continued use of towers and dependence on outsourced site development services by the wireless communications industry; and our ability to successfully estimate certain accounting and tax matters, including the effect on our company of adopting certain accounting pronouncements and the availability of sufficient net operating losses to offset taxable income. non-gaap financial measures this report contains certain non-gaap measures, including adjusted ebitda and segment operating profit information. we have provided below a description of such non-gaap measures, a reconciliation of such non-gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures, an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures, their respective limitations and how management compensates for such limitations. adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as loss from continuing operations plus net interest expense, provision for taxes, depreciation, accretion and amortization, asset impairment and other charges, non-cash compensation, and other expenses and excluding non-cash leasing revenue, non-cash ground lease expense and other income. we have included this non-gaap financial measure because we believe this item is an indicator of the performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results. in addition, adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with some of our debt instruments, particularly our senior credit facility. adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income as determined in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measurement of adjusted ebitda has certain material limitations, including: it does not include interest expense. because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits and cash flows. therefore any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations, it does not include depreciation, accretion and amortization expense. because we use capital assets, depreciation, accretion and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits. therefore any measure that excludes depreciation, accretion and amortization expense has material limitations, it does not include provision for taxes. because the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our costs, particularly in the future, any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations, it does not include non-cash expenses such as asset impairment and other charges, non-cash compensation, other expenses, non-cash leasing revenue and non-cash ground lease expense. because these non-cash items are a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate profits, any measure that excludes these non-cash items has material limitations, and it does not include costs related to transition, integration, severance and bonuses associated with the aat acquisition. because these costs are indicative of actual company expenses, any measure that excludes these costs has material limitations. 44 table of contents we compensate for these limitations by using adjusted ebitda as only one of several comparative tools, together with gaap measurements, to assist in the evaluation of our profitability and operating results. the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda is as follows: for the year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) loss from continuing operations $ (133,448 ) $ (94,648 ) $ (144,023 ) add back (deduct): interest income (3,814 ) (2,096 ) (516 ) interest expense 81,283

$ 95,322 $ 78,794 segment operating profit each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues (excluding depreciation, accretion and amortization). total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the two segments. segment operating profit is, in our opinion, an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment, while excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization which is largely fixed. segment operating profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or gross profit as determined in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measurement of segment operating profit has certain material limitations. specifically this measurement does not include depreciation, accretion, and amortization expense. as we use capital assets in our business, depreciation, accretion, and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profit. therefore any measure that excludes depreciation, accretion and amortization expense has material limitations. we compensate for these limitations by using segment operating profit as only one of several comparative tools, together with gaap measurements, to assist in the evaluation of the cash generation of our segment operations. 45 table of contents site leasing segment for the year ended december 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) segment revenue $ 256,170 $ 161,277

risks related to our business we have a substantial level of indebtedness which we may not have the ability to repay or refinance at commercially reasonable terms or at all. as indicated below, we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. the following table sets forth our total debt and shareholders equity as of december 31, 2006 and december 31, 2007. as of december 31, 2006 2007 (in thousands) total indebtedness $ 1,555,000 $ 1,905,000 shareholders equity $ 385,921 $ 337,391 our indebtedness as of december 31, 2007 consists of $1.555 billion of commercial mortgage-backed pass-through certificates, which we refer to as our cmbs certificates, and $350.0 million of 0.375% convertible senior notes, which we refer to as our notes. in addition, subsequent to december 31, 2007 we entered into a $285.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. proceeds from the facility may only be used to purchase or construct towers and/or purchase the land underlying our towers. our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal, interest or other amounts when due. subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured debt. this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage. we will not be able to amortize and repay our substantial indebtedness, when due, from cash from operating activities. upon maturity, our indebtedness will need to be repaid from asset sales or equity issuances or will need to be refinanced. as a consequence of our indebtedness, (1) demands on our cash resources may increase, (2) we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and (3) we may choose to institute self-imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our relative leverage and our strategic plans. for example, as a result of our indebtedness: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best long-term interest; we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments, including capital expenditures; we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry; we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged; and we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations. these restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. 11 table of contents in addition, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur under our senior secured revolving credit facility and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness, including our cmbs certificates at a commercially reasonable rate or at all. there is no guarantee future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness. any slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could adversely affect our future growth and revenues. demand for antenna space on our towers and for our site development services depends on demand for wireless services. in 2001 through 2003, economic downturns in the u.s. economy, including the wireless telecommunications industry, negatively influenced demand for tower space and site development services. similar slowdowns in the future may adversely affect consumer demand for wireless services; the financial condition of the wireless service providers; the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures; the availability and cost of capital, including interest rates; volatility in the equity and debt markets; and the willingness of our tenants to renew their leases for additional terms. as a result of these factors wireless service providers may delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies, including 3g, 4g or other wireless services or, worse, elect not to renew existing antenna leases in order to reduce operating expenses. we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline. if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease, we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected. this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations. our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for independently owned towers. if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. demand for our services may decline if there is significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers as they may then reduce capital expenditures in the aggregate or fail to renew existing leases for tower space because many of their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap. as a result of regulatory changes in january 2003 which removed prior restrictions on wireless service providers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area, there have been significant consolidations of the large wireless service providers. specifically, cingular acquired at&amp;t wireless in october 2004 and sprint pcs and nextel merged to form sprint nextel corporation in august 2005. as a result of the cingular/at&amp;t wireless merger, as of december 31, 2007, at&amp;t had terminated 164 tenant leases with us, which had $4.0 million of annualized rental revenue, on towers where both cingular and at&amp;t wireless had previously had antennas. in addition, at&amp;t did not renew certain tenant leases for other communication sites in close proximity to the extent that it believed it did not need the additional capacity. although we have not currently experienced any significant amount of churn as a result of the sprint/nextel merger, due primarily to the different 12 table of contents technologies utilized and their decision to operate two networks, we may in the future experience terminations and/or non-renewals due to this merger. furthermore, to the extent that other wireless service providers consolidate in the future, they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers and/or may not lease as much space on our towers in the future. this would adversely affect our growth, our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness. similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space. wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider services. wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communication sites owned or controlled by us or others. the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate. there can be no assurances that 3g, 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated. the deployment of 3g has already experienced significant delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries. the announcement of 4g is relatively new and its deployment has been limited to date. additionally, the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated. we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue, therefore if any of our significant customers reduced their demand for tower space or became financially unstable it may materially decrease our revenues. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. the loss of any one of our significant customers, as a result of bankruptcy, consolidation, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth. the following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of our total revenue for the specified time periods derived from these customers: percentage of total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2005 2006 2007 sprint 30.9 % 27.6 % 30.5 % at&amp;t 25.5 % 21.4 % 21.0 % 13 table of contents we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments: percentage of site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31, 2005 2006 2007 sprint 30.7 % 26.2 % 26.5 % at&amp;t 28.0 % 26.7 % 25.6 % verizon wireless 10.1 % 9.7 % 10.0 % percentage of site development consulting revenue for the year ended december 31, 2005 2006 2007 sprint 1.9 % 38.0 % 59.7 % verizon wireless 32.4 % 26.6 % 17.4 % bechtel corporation* 23.3 % 10.0 % 0.8 % at&amp;t 28.3 % 6.8 % percentage of site development construction revenue for the year ended december 31, 2005 2006 2007 sprint 36.0 % 30.0 % 39.8 % at&amp;t 20.3 % 6.9 % 5.6 % bechtel corporation* 11.6 % 17.4 % 5.3 % * substantially all of the work performed for bechtel corporation was for its client at&amp;t. revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts. each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant. however, if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty, substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us, our revenues, future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected. our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. in addition, a customer need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. furthermore, our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects. increasing competition in the tower industry may adversely affect us. our industry is highly competitive. competitive pressures for tenants from our competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income. in addition, the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers would lead to an accompanying adverse effect on our revenues, margins and financial condition. 14 table of contents in the site leasing business, we compete with: wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers; other large independent tower companies; smaller local independent tower companies; and alternative facilities such as rooftops, broadcast towers and utility poles. there has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past three years. specifically, american tower corp. completed its merger with spectrasite, inc. in 2005, we completed our aat acquisition in 2006 and crown castle international completed its merger with global signal, inc. in 2007. as a result of these consolidations, american tower and crown castle are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us. this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers. wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally substantially larger and may have greater financial resources than we do. we believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service and, to a lesser extent, price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive. there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business. as a result of this competition, margins in this segment continue to be under pressure. many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable. if margins in this segment were to further decrease, our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected. the market price of our class a common stock could be affected by significant volatility, which could adversely impact our ability to use equity to fund our growth plan. the market price of our class a common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations. the market price of our class a common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed elsewhere in risk factors and in forward-looking statements. volatility or depressed market prices of our class a common stock could make it difficult for shareholders to resell their shares of class a common stock, when they want or at attractive prices. consequently, volatility of the market price of our class a common stock may make it less likely that sellers will accept our equity as consideration in connection with our tower acquisitions and may make it more difficult for us to use our equity to fund our future growth plans. if we were unable to use equity to fund growth of our tower portfolio, we may be required to either use debt to increase our tower portfolio or reduce our anticipated growth. increasing competition to acquire existing towers may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio at anticipated rates. we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio 5% to 10% annually through acquisitions and new builds. our ability to meet these growth targets significantly depends on our ability to acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements. traditionally, our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies, independent tower developers and wireless service providers. however, as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these mid-sized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers. increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, higher acquisition prices, reduced willingness of sellers to accept equity as consideration for 15 table of contents their towers and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers. furthermore, to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios, many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us. if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals. we may not be able to build as many towers as we anticipate. we currently intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2008. however, our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction, our ability to locate, and acquire at commercially reasonable prices, attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits. due to these risks, it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated, the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2008. if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals. risks associated with our plans to increase our tower portfolio could negatively impact our results of operations or our financial condition. we currently intend to increase our tower portfolio through new builds and acquisitions. we intend to review available acquisition opportunities and some of these acquisitions could have the effect of materially increasing our tower portfolio. while we intend to fund a portion of the cash required to implement this plan from our cash flow from operating activities, we may finance some or all of the costs associated with these new builds and acquisitions. furthermore, if we were to consummate any significant acquisition, we might be required to finance these acquisitions through additional indebtedness, which would increase our indebtedness and interest expense and could increase our leverage ratio, and/or issuances of equity, which could be dilutive to our shareholders. if we were unable to recognize the expected returns from these new towers, or if we did not recognize the expected returns in our anticipated time frames, an increase in debt levels without a proportionate increase in our revenues could negatively impact our results of operations and our financial condition. our short-term investments portfolio contains auction rate securities that we may not be able to liquidate at their market value, or at all. we previously invested a portion of our liquidity in auction rate securities. credit concerns in the capital markets have significantly reduced our ability to liquidate some of the auction rate securities that we classify as short-term investments in current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. these securities represent interests in contingent capital structures, corporate credit default swaps and redundant reserve life insurance structures. none of the underlying collateral for the auction rate securities we held consisted of sub-prime residential or commercial mortgages. as a result of our assessment of a number of factors, including without limitation, market conditions and the credit quality of these securities, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $15.6 million to reduce the value of our auction rate securities to their estimated fair value of $55.1 million as of december 31, 2007. as of february 22, 2008, we still own auction rate securities with a par value of $29.8 million and a current estimated fair value of $14.2 million. due to the lack of a secondary market for our auction rate securities, the established fair value of these securities is a matter of judgment. if our estimates regarding the fair value of these securities are incorrect, a future other-than-temporary impairment charge may be required. in the future the credit markets may continue to deteriorate causing further declines in the value of the securities which could lead to additional other-than-temporary impairment charges being reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. 16 table of contents our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility. our senior secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants. among other things, these covenants limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; sell assets; make certain investments; engage in certain restricted payments from sba senior finance to us; engage in mergers or consolidations; incur liens; and enter into affiliate transactions. these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, merger and acquisitions or other opportunities. if we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under the senior secured revolving credit facility. in addition, if we default in the payment of our other indebtedness, including under our cmbs certificates and our notes, then such default could cause a cross-default under our senior secured revolving credit facility. the mortgage loan relating to our cmbs certificates also contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum debt service coverage ratio. to the extent that the debt service coverage, as of the end of any calendar quarter, (1) is less than 1.30 times, all cash flow generated by the pledged towers must be deposited into a reserve account and (2) is less than 1.15 times, then an amortization period will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15 times for a calendar quarter. as lease payments from 4,975 towers of our total tower portfolio are pledged as collateral under the mortgage loan, if this cash flow was not available to us it would adversely impact our ability to pay our indebtedness, other than the mortgage loan, and to operate our business. new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations. the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers. for example, the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space. additionally, the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity, such as beam forming or smart antenna, that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space. the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require ground-based sites, such as the growth in delivery of video, voice and data services by satellites or other technologies, could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space. 17 table of contents our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business. we are a holding company with no business operations of our own. our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. we conduct, and expect to conduct, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us. additionally, the borrowers on the mortgage loan supporting the cmbs certificates must repay the components of the mortgage loan. if such borrowers cash flow is insufficient to cover such repayments, we may be required to refinance the mortgage loan or sell a portion or all of our interests in the 4,975 tower sites that secure, along with their operating cash flows, the mortgage loan. other than the cash required to repay amounts due under the cmbs certificates, we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing their debt obligations. our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to repay our notes, the components of the mortgage loan pursuant to the cmbs certificates (other than those entities obligated under the cmbs certificates), or make any funds available to us for payment. the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility and the cmbs certificates. our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations. the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of long-term results. numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including: the timing and amount of our customers capital expenditures; the size and scope of our projects; the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers fiscal year; delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment; seasonal factors, such as weather, vacation days and total business days in a quarter; the use of third party providers by our customers; the rate and volume of wireless service providers network development; and general economic conditions. although the demand for our site development services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts. in addition, the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long. therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services. 18 table of contents we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses. we are not profitable. the following table shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated: for the year ended december 31, 2005 2006 2007 (in thousands) net loss $ (94,709 ) $ (133,448 ) $ (77,879 ) our losses are principally due to depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, interest expense (including non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees), and losses from the write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt in the periods presented above. we expect to continue to incur significant losses, which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness. the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business. our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel. we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel. we have employment agreements with jeffrey a. stoops, our president and chief executive officer, kurt l. bagwell, our senior vice president and chief operating officer, thomas p. hunt, our chief administrative officer and general counsel and anthony j. macaione, our senior vice president and chief financial officer. we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel. if we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency ( rf ) energy. the government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to rf energy. exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects. the potential connection between low-level rf energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. according to the federal communications commission (the fcc ), the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive. however, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. in particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services. moreover, if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. if we were subject to claims relating to rf energy, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business. we are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business. in particular, both the federal aviation administration ( faa ) and federal communications commission ( fcc ) regulate the construction and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas. in addition, the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures. faa and fcc regulations govern construction, lighting, painting and marking of towers and structures and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure, require registration of the tower or structure. certain proposals to construct new towers or structures, to modify existing towers or structures, or to use the towers or structures to operate on a certain frequency or frequency band are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure or its use will not present a hazard to air navigation. 19 table of contents antenna tower and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. antenna tower and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction. certain proposals to construct or modify antenna towers and structures or to operate wireless communications or radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements. failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply. in addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth. local regulations, including city and other local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and antenna structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction or modification. local regulations can delay, prevent, or increase the cost of new construction, co-locations, or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. in addition, new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations. our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters. our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes. we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. we also maintain third party liability insurance, subject to loss limits and deductibles, to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured, or damage to a significant number of our towers, could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes. as owner, lessee or operator of numerous tower sites, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. however, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have adopted anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. we adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes. these provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. 20 table of contents our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future. the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986. we may also have a future ownership change, outside of our control, caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders. depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change, an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income. currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized. future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equity-related offerings. sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market, including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of the notes, could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. we cannot predict the effect that future sales of our class a common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our class a common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 44 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business. we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by only carrying long-term fixed rate debt at december 31, 2007. the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and interest rates associated with our long-term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness as of december 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 thereafter total fair value (in thousands) long-term debt: fixed rate cmbs certificates (1) $ $ $ 405,000 $ 1,150,000 $ $ $ 1,555,000 $ 1,519,854 0.375% convertible senior notes $ $ $ 350,000 $ $ $ $ 350,000 $ 393,313 (1) the anticipated repayment date is november 2010 for the $405,000 of initial cmbs certificates and november 2011 for the $1,150,000 of additional cmbs certificates. our current primary market risk exposure relates to (1) the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to refinance the cmbs certificates at their expected repayment dates or at maturity at market rates, and (2) our ability to meet financial covenants. we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our use of fixed rate debt. while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis. we also face market risk exposure associated with our investment in auction rate securities. the current conditions in the credit markets have resulted in an other-than-temporary impairment of these securities of $15.6 million as of december 31, 2007. continued deterioration in the credit and equity markets, continued failed auctions or the lack of a developing secondary market may all potentially cause further impairment in the value of these securities or negatively impact our ability to liquidate these securities. our wholly-owned subsidiary, sba senior finance obtained a three-year senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $285.0 million, based on compliance with certain financial ratios on january 18, 2008. amounts borrowed under the facility will accrue interest at libor plus a margin that ranges from 150 basis points to 300 basis points or at a base rate plus a margin that ranges from 50 basis points to 200 basis points, based on consolidated total debt to annualized sba senior finance ebitda ratio (excluding the impact from the borrowers under the mortgage loan underlying the cmbs certificates). consequently, in the future we will be subject to interest rate risk on those floating rate loans that are outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility. 44 table of contents special note regarding forward-looking statements this annual report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements concern expectations, beliefs, projections, plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. specifically, this annual report contains forward-looking statements regarding: our expectation that we will continue to incur losses; our expectations that the growth of the wireless industry and the impact of recent developments will result in the continued long-term growth of our site leasing revenues and site leasing segment operating profit; our intention to grow our tower portfolio by 5% to 10% in 2008, including our intent to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2008, expectations regarding our ability to meet our tower new build and acquisition targets, the amount and type of consideration that will be paid or expended and our projections regarding the financial impact of these activities; our intention to have at least one signed tenant lease on each new build tower on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants; our intent to build towers in locations where multiple wireless services providers need, or will need, to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands; our belief that our towers have significant capacity to accommodate additional tenants, that our tower operations are highly scalable and that we can add tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs; our belief regarding our position to capture additional site leasing business in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets; our belief that our site leasing business will permit us to maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending; our estimates regarding our liquidity, capital expenditures and sources of both, and our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due; our expectations regarding our cash capital expenditures in 2008 for maintenance and augmentation and for new tower builds, tower acquisitions and ground lease purchases and our ability to fund such cash capital expenditures; our intent and ability to continue to purchase and/or enter into long-term leases for the land that underlies our towers and the effect of such ground lease purchases on our margins and long-term financial condition; our estimates regarding our annual debt service in 2008 and thereafter; our estimates of the fair value of our auction rate securities and expectations regarding our ability to liquidate such securities within the year; and our estimates regarding certain accounting and tax matters, including the adoption of certain accounting pronouncements and the availability of sufficient net operating losses to offset future taxable income. these forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. we wish to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. the most important factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals, and cause the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: 45 table of contents our ability to sufficiently increase our revenues and maintain expenses and cash capital expenditures at appropriate levels to permit us to meet our anticipated uses of liquidity for operations and estimated portfolio growth; the ability of our clients to access sufficient capital or their willingness to expend capital to fund network expansion or enhancements; our ability to continue to comply with covenants and the terms of our credit instruments; our ability to secure as many site leasing tenants as planned, including our ability to retain current leases on towers and deal with the impact, if any, of recent consolidation among wireless service providers; our ability to identify towers and land underneath towers that would be attractive to our clients and accretive to our financial results; and to negotiate and consummate agreements to acquire such towers and land; our ability to build 80 to 100 towers in 2008; our ability to secure and deliver anticipated services business at contemplated margins; market conditions that may affect the liquidity of our short-term investments; our ability to successfully and timely address zoning issues, permitting and other issues that arise in connection with the building of new towers; our ability to realize economies of scale from our tower portfolio; the business climate for the wireless communications industry in general and the wireless communications infrastructure providers in particular; the continued use of towers and dependence on outsourced site development services by the wireless communications industry; and our ability to successfully estimate certain accounting and tax matters, including the effect on our company of adopting certain accounting pronouncements and the availability of sufficient net operating losses to offset taxable income. 46 table of contents non-gaap financial measures this report contains certain non-gaap measures, including adjusted ebitda and segment operating profit information. we have provided below a description of such non-gaap measures, a reconciliation of such non-gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures, an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures, their respective limitations and how management compensates for such limitations. adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as loss from continuing operations excluding the impact of net interest expense (including amortization of deferred financing fees), provision for taxes, depreciation, accretion and amortization, asset impairment and other (credits) charges, non-cash compensation, loss from write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt, other income and expense (including in the fourth quarter of 2007 the $15.6 million other-than-temporary impairment charge on our auction rate securities), non-cash leasing revenue, non-cash ground lease expense and one-time costs related to transition and integration costs in connection with the aat acquisition. we have included this non-gaap financial measure because we believe this item is an indicator of the profitability and performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results. adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income as determined in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measurement of adjusted ebitda has certain material limitations, including: it does not include interest expense. because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits and cash flows. therefore any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations, it does not include depreciation, accretion and amortization expense. as we use capital assets, depreciation, accretion and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits. therefore any measure that excludes depreciation, accretion and amortization expense has material limitations, it does not include provision for taxes. because the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our costs, particularly in the future, any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations, it does not include non-cash expenses such as asset impairment and other charges, non-cash compensation, other expenses/income, non-cash leasing revenue and non-cash ground lease expense. because these non-cash items are a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate profits, any measure that excludes these non-cash items has material limitations, and it does not include costs related to transition and integration costs associated with the aat acquisition. because these costs are indicative of actual expenses incurred by us, any measure that excludes these costs has material limitations. we compensate for these limitations by using adjusted ebitda as only one of several comparative tools, together with gaap measurements, to assist in the evaluation of our profitability and operating results. 47 table of contents the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda is as follows: for the year ended december 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) loss from continuing operations $ (77,879 ) $ (133,448 ) $ (94,648 ) interest income (10,182 ) (3,814 ) (2,096 ) interest expense 101,032

defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues (excluding depreciation, accretion and amortization). total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the three segments. segment operating profit is, in our opinion, an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment, while excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization which is largely fixed. segment operating profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or gross profit as determined in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measurement of segment operating profit has certain material limitations. specifically this measurement does not include depreciation, accretion, and amortization expense. as we use capital assets in our business, depreciation, accretion, and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profit. therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation, accretion and amortization expense has material limitations. we compensate for these limitations by using segment operating profit as only one of several comparative tools, together with gaap measurements, to assist in the evaluation of the operating performance of our segments. the reconciliation of site leasing segment operating profit, site development consulting segment operating profit and site development construction segment operating profit are as follows: site leasing segment for the year ended december 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) segment revenue $ 321,818 $ 256,170 $ 161,277 segment cost of revenues (excluding depreciation, accretion and amortization) (88,006 ) (70,663 ) (47,259

large portion of which we will need to refinance in the next three years. in the event we are not able to refinance or repay such indebtedness, we may not be able to access the cash flow from all of our towers and we may need to take certain actions to service our debt obligations. we have a substantial amount of indebtedness (approximately $2.55 billion as of december 31, 2008), and we anticipate refinancing a significant amount of this indebtedness within the next three years. as of february 24, 2009, we had $2.0 billion of indebtedness outstanding that has an initial or anticipated maturity date within the next three years, including $391.8 million of our 2005 commercial mortgage-backed pass-through certificates (which have an anticipated repayment date of november 2010), $1.1 billion of our 2006 commercial mortgage-backed pass-through certificates (which have an anticipated repayment date of november 2011), $104.2 million of 0.375% convertible senior notes due november 2010, $230.6 million of borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and $149.0 million under our credit facility assumed in the optasite acquisition (the optasite credit facility ) (each facility matures in 2010). if our cmbs certificates are not fully repaid by their anticipated repayment dates, november 2010 for the 2005 cmbs certificates and november 2011 for the 2006 cmbs certificates, then the interest rates on each of the cmbs certificates, on such date, will increase by the greater of (i) 5% or (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year u.s. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component. such additional interest will accrue and be payable once the principal of all cmbs certificates are repaid. furthermore, if our 2005 cmbs certificates are not fully repaid by november 2010, then substantially all of the cash flows from the 4,969 towers owned by the borrowers under the cmbs certificates will be trapped by the trustee and applied first to repay the original cash coupons on the cmbs certificates, then to fund reserves and administrative costs and then to repay principal of the 2005 and the 2006 cmbs certificates in the order of their investment grade (i.e. the 2005-1a and 2006-1a subclasses would have their respective principal repaid equally prior to repayment of the other subclasses of the cmbs certificates). if we are unable to repay our 2005 cmbs certificates on november 2010, then we would only have access to the cash flow generated by the remaining approximately 2,900 towers to repay our other indebtedness and pay all our other corporate expenses. during 2007 a crisis began in the subprime mortgage sector of the u.s. economy as a result of credit quality deterioration and rising delinquencies, and that crisis has continued and strengthened throughout 2008 and into 2009 which has led to continued deterioration of the credit markets, a closing up of the debt markets and widening credit spreads. also stemming from this crisis, the u.s. economy is undergoing a period of recession, slowdown and high volatility. this crisis has adversely impacted our access to capital, and there can be no assurance that this crisis will not worsen or impact the availability or cost of debt financing in the future. there can be no assurance that we will be able to effect the anticipated refinancing described above on terms as favorable as our current debt, on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. if we are unable to refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will generate enough cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt obligations and fund our planned capital expenditures. in such event, we might need to sell certain assets or lines of business, issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock to fulfill our debt obligations. if implemented, these actions could negatively impact our business or dilute our existing shareholders. 11 table of contents we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities. as indicated below, we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. the following table sets forth our total debt and shareholders equity as of december 31, 2007 and 2008. as of december 31, 2007 2008 (in thousands) total indebtedness $ 1,905,000 $ 2,554,660 shareholders equity $ 337,391 $ 491,759 our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal, interest or other amounts when due. subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured debt. this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage. as a consequence of our indebtedness, (1) demands on our cash resources may increase, (2) we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and (3) we may choose to institute self-imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our relative leverage and our strategic plans. for example, as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the u.s. economy: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best long-term interests; we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments, including capital expenditures; we have already reduced our annual tower acquisition goals and may, in the future, be required to reduce our annual tower new build goals; we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry; we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged; and we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations. these restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. in addition, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur under our senior secured revolving credit facility and our optasite credit facility assumed in the optasite acquisition and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness, including our cmbs certificates at a commercially reasonable rate or at all. there is no guarantee future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness. 12 table of contents any slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could adversely affect our future growth and revenues. demand for antenna space on our towers and for our site development services depends on demand for wireless services. from 2001 through 2003, economic downturns in the u.s. economy, including the wireless telecommunications industry, negatively influenced demand for tower space and site development services. the current economic downturn in the u.s. economy and similar slowdowns in the future may adversely affect: consumer demand for wireless services; the financial condition of wireless service providers; the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures; the availability and cost of capital, including interest rates; volatility in the equity and debt markets; and the willingness of our tenants to renew their leases for additional terms. as a result of these factors wireless service providers may delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies, including 3g, 4g or other wireless services or, worse, elect not to renew existing antenna leases in order to reduce operating expenses. we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline. if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease, we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected. this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations. our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers. if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. demand for our services may decline if there is additional significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers as they may then reduce capital expenditures in the aggregate or fail to renew existing leases for tower space because many of their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap. as a result of regulatory changes in january 2003 which removed prior restrictions on wireless service providers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area, there have been significant consolidations of the large wireless service providers. specifically, cingular acquired at&amp;t wireless in october 2004 and sprint pcs and nextel merged to form sprint nextel corporation in august 2005. as a result of the cingular/at&amp;t wireless merger, as of december 31, 2008, at&amp;t had terminated 307 tenant leases with us, which had $7.7 million of annualized rental revenue, on towers where both cingular and at&amp;t wireless had previously had antennas. in addition, at&amp;t did not renew certain tenant leases for other communication sites in close proximity to the extent that it believed it did not need the additional capacity. although we have not currently experienced any significant amount of churn as a result of the sprint/nextel merger, due primarily to the different technologies utilized and their decision to operate two networks, we may in the future experience terminations and/or non-renewals due to this merger. furthermore, to the extent that other wireless service providers consolidate in the future, they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers and/or may not lease as much space on our towers in the future. this would adversely affect our growth, our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness. 13 table of contents similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space. wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider services. wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communication sites owned or controlled by us or others. the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate. there can be no assurances that 3g, 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated. the deployment of 3g has already experienced significant delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries. the announcement of 4g is relatively new and its deployment has been limited to date. additionally, the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated. we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue, therefore if any of our significant customers reduced their demand for tower space or became financially unstable it may materially decrease our revenues. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. the loss of any one of our significant customers, as a result of bankruptcy, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth. the following is a list of significant customers (representing at least 10% of revenue in any of the last three years) and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers: percentage of total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006 2007 2008 sprint 27.6 % 30.5 % 23.2 % at&amp;t 21.4 % 21.0 % 21.3 % verizon wireless 9.7 % 9.7 % 11.2 % 14 table of contents we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments: percentage of site leasing revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006 2007 2008 at&amp;t 26.7 % 25.6 % 25.3 % sprint 26.2 % 26.5 % 25.1 % verizon wireless 9.7 % 10.0 % 11.1 % percentage of site development consulting revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006 2007 2008 verizon wireless 26.6 % 17.4 % 24.1 % sprint 38.0 % 59.7 % 22.9 % metro pcs 0.7 % 3.9 % 13.3 % percentage of site development construction revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006 2007 2008 t-mobile 4.6 % 5.8 % 15.8 % metro pcs 0.2 % 1.1 % 11.9 % sprint 30.0 % 39.8 % 10.8 % revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts. each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant. however, if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty, substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us, our revenues, future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected. our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. in addition, a customer need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. furthermore, our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects. increasing competition in the tower industry may adversely affect us. our industry is highly competitive. competitive pressures for tenants could adversely affect our lease rates. in addition, the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers would lead to an accompanying adverse effect on our revenues, margins and financial condition. in the site leasing business, we compete with: wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers; other large independent tower companies; 15 table of contents smaller local independent tower companies; and alternative facilities such as rooftops, broadcast towers and utility poles. there has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past three years. specifically, american tower corporation completed its merger with spectrasite, inc. in 2005, we completed our acquisition of aat communication corporation in 2006 and crown castle international completed its merger with global signal, inc. in 2007. as a result of these consolidations, american tower and crown castle are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us. this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers. wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally substantially larger and may have greater financial resources than we do. we believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and, to a lesser extent, price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive. there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business. as a result of this competition, margins in this segment continue to be under pressure. many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable. if margins in this segment were to further decrease, our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected. the market price of our class a common stock could be affected by significant volatility, which could adversely impact our ability to use equity to fund our growth plan. the market price of our class a common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations. since the fall of 2008, the u.s. stock market has been undergoing a period of very high volatility where changes in the market prices of equity securities have often been abrupt and profound over short periods of time. the market price of our class a common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed elsewhere in risk factors and in forward-looking statements. volatility or depressed market prices of our class a common stock could make it difficult for shareholders to resell their shares of class a common stock, when they want or at attractive prices. consequently, volatility of the market price of our class a common stock may make it less likely that sellers will accept our equity as consideration in connection with our tower acquisitions and may make it more difficult for us to use our equity to fund our future growth plans. if we were unable to use equity to fund growth of our tower portfolio, we may be required to either use debt to increase our tower portfolio or reduce our anticipated growth. counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to fulfill their obligations and such failure could subject us to significant costs to replace any such portion of our convertible note hedge transactions or subject us to potential dilution or additional cost, if settled in cash, upon conversion of our convertible notes. concurrently with the pricing of our 0.375% notes and our 1.875% notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of both convertible note offerings. the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 0.375% notes is $33.56 per share of our class a common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the 0.375% notes) and cover 10,429,720 shares of our class a common stock. the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1.875% notes is $41.46 per share of our class a common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of our 1.875% convertible notes) and cover 13,265,780 shares of our class a common stock. 16 table of contents since the fall of 2008, global economic conditions and the financial markets have been and continue to be volatile. certain financial institutions have filed for bankruptcy, have sold some or all of their assets, or may be looking to enter into a merger or other transaction with another financial institution. as a result of these conditions, some of the counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to perform their obligations under such instruments. one of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with our 1.875% notes was with lehman brothers otc derivatives inc. ( lehman derivatives ) which covers 55% of the 13,265,780 shares of our class a common stock potentially issuable upon conversion. in october 2008, lehman derivatives filed a voluntary petition for protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code which constituted an event of default under the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives. as a result, on november 7, 2008 we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives. based on information available to us, we have no indication, as of the date of filing this form 10-k, that any party other than lehman derivatives would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us under the convertible note hedge transactions. if we were to elect to replace the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives or any other counterparty, we would incur significant costs to replace such hedge transactions. additionally, if we do not elect to replace our convertible note hedge transactions that were previously with lehman derivatives or any other counterparty fails to perform its obligations under our outstanding convertible note hedge transactions, we would be subject to potential dilution or additional cost, if settled in cash, upon conversion of the applicable 0.375% notes and 1.875% notes. increasing competition to acquire existing towers may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio long-term. although our current plans only contemplate modest growth of our tower portfolio in 2009, primarily through new tower builds, our ability to achieve material long-term tower portfolio growth will depend on our ability to acquire towers from third parties. traditionally, our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies, independent tower developers and wireless service providers. however, as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these mid-sized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers. increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, higher acquisition prices, reduced willingness of sellers to accept equity as consideration for their towers and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers. furthermore, to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios, many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us. if we are not able to successfully resolve these issues, we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the long-term. we may not be able to build as many towers as we anticipate. we currently intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2009. however, our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction, our ability to locate, and acquire at commercially reasonable prices, attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits. due to these risks, it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated, the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2009. if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals. our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility. our senior secured revolving credit facility and the optasite credit facility contain certain restrictive covenants. among other things, these covenants limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; 17 table of contents sell assets; make certain investments; engage in certain restricted payments from sba senior finance to us; engage in mergers or consolidations; incur liens; and enter into affiliate transactions. these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, merger and acquisitions or other opportunities. if we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under the senior secured revolving credit facility. in addition, if we default in the payment of our other indebtedness, including under our cmbs certificates and our notes, then such default could cause a cross-default under our senior secured revolving credit facility. the mortgage loan relating to our cmbs certificates also contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum debt service coverage ratio. to the extent that the debt service coverage, as of the end of any calendar quarter, (1) is less than 1.30 times, all cash flow generated by the pledged towers must be deposited into a reserve account and (2) is less than 1.15 times, then an amortization period will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15 times for a calendar quarter. as lease payments from 4,969 towers of our total tower portfolio are pledged as collateral under the mortgage loan, if this cash flow was not available to us it would adversely impact our ability to pay our indebtedness, other than the mortgage loan, and to operate our business. new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations. the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers. for example, the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space. additionally, the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity, such as beam forming or smart antennae, that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space. the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require ground-based sites, such as the growth in delivery of video, voice and data services by satellites or other technologies, could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space. our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business. we are a holding company with no business operations of our own. our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. we conduct, and expect to conduct, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us. additionally, the borrowers on the mortgage loan supporting the cmbs certificates must repay the components of the mortgage loan. if such 18 table of contents borrowers cash flow is insufficient to cover such repayments, we may be required to refinance the mortgage loan or sell a portion or all of our interests in the 4,969 tower sites that secure, along with their operating cash flows, the mortgage loan. other than the cash required to repay amounts due under the cmbs certificates, we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing their debt obligations. our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to repay our notes, the components of the mortgage loan pursuant to the cmbs certificates (other than those entities obligated under the cmbs certificates), or make any funds available to us for payment. the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility and the cmbs certificates. our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations. the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of long-term results. numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including: the timing and amount of our customers capital expenditures; the size and scope of our projects; the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers fiscal year; delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment; seasonal factors, such as weather, vacation days and total business days in a quarter; the use of third party providers by our customers; the rate and volume of wireless service providers network development; and general economic conditions. although the demand for our site development services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts. in addition, the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long. therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services. we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses. we are not profitable. the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated: for the year ended december 31, 2006 2007 2008 (in thousands) net loss $ (133,448 ) $ (77,879 ) $ (46,763 ) our losses are principally due to depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, interest expense (including non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees), and losses from the write-off of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt as well as impairment charges on our towers and auction rate securities in the periods presented above. we expect to continue to incur significant losses, which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness. 19 table of contents the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business. our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel. we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel. we have employment agreements with jeffrey a. stoops, our president and chief executive officer, kurt l. bagwell, our senior vice president and chief operating officer and thomas p. hunt, our senior vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel. we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel. if we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency ( rf ) energy. the government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy. exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects. the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. according to the federal communications commission (the fcc ), the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive. however, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. in particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services. moreover, if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business. we are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business. in particular, both the federal aviation administration ( faa ) and fcc regulate the construction, modification and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas. in addition, the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures. faa and fcc regulations govern construction, lighting, painting and marking of towers and structures and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure, require registration of the tower or structure. certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages. certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements. failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply. in addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth. local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to 20 table of contents obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification. local regulations can delay, prevent, or increase the cost of new construction, co-locations, or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. in addition, new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations. our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters. our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes. we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. we also maintain third party liability insurance, subject to loss limits and deductibles, to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured, or damage to a significant number of our towers, could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes. as owner, lessee or operator of numerous tower sites, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. however, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have adopted anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. we adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes. these provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future. the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986. we may also have a future ownership change, outside of our control, caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders. depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change, an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income. currently, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized. 21 table of contents future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equity-related offerings. sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market, including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of the notes, could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. we cannot predict the effect that future sales of our class a common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our class a common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business. the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and fair value associated with our long-term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness as of december 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 thereafter total fair value (in thousands)

135,729 (1) the anticipated repayment date is november 2010 for the initial cmbs certificates and november 2011 for the additional cmbs certificates. our current primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk relating to (1) the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to refinance the cmbs certificates on their expected repayment dates or at maturity at market rates, (2) our ability to meet financial covenants and (3) the interest rate associated with our floating rate loans that are outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility and the optasite credit facility. we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our use of fixed rate debt. while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis. special note regarding forward-looking statements this annual report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements concern expectations, beliefs, projections, plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. specifically, this annual report contains forward-looking statements regarding: our expectation that we will continue to incur losses; our expectations that site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional space on our towers due to increasing minutes of use, network expansion and network coverage requirements; our belief that our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal capital expenditures; our expectations regarding the growth of our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications; 49 table of contents our intent to grow our tower portfolio only modestly in 2009, primarily through new tower builds; our intent to build 80 to 100 new towers in 2009 and our intent to have at least one signed tenant lease on each new tower on the day it is completed; our intent to limit our acquisition strategy to stock acquisitions that will be accretive to our shareholders, and to resume acquisitions for cash when we see sufficient improvement in the credit markets; our expectations regarding the amount of future cash capital expenditures, both discretionary and non-discretionary, including expenditures required to maintain, improve and modify our towers; our belief that our towers have significant capacity to accommodate additional tenants, that our tower operations are highly scalable and that we can add tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs; our belief regarding our position to capture additional site leasing business in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets; our expectations regarding our cash capital expenditures in 2009 for maintenance and augmentation and for new tower builds and ground lease purchases and our ability to fund such cash capital expenditures; actions we may pursue to manage our leverage position and ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants including the amount, consideration or price that we may pay in connection with any debt repurchases; our estimates regarding our liquidity, our sources of liquidity and our ability to fund operations, and refinance or repay our obligations as they become due; our estimates regarding our annual debt service in 2009 and thereafter, and our belief that our cash flows from operations for the next twelve months will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months; our expectations regarding the impact of our convertible note hedge transactions, and the termination of such transactions, with lehman derivatives; our intent and ability to continue to purchase and/or enter into long-term leases for the land that underlies our towers and the effect of such ground lease purchases on our margins and long-term financial condition; and our estimates regarding certain accounting and tax matters, including the adoption of certain accounting pronouncements and the availability of sufficient net operating losses to offset future taxable income. these forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. we wish to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. the most important factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals, and cause the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: our ability to sufficiently increase our revenues and maintain expenses and cash capital expenditures at appropriate levels to permit us to meet our anticipated uses of liquidity for operations and estimated portfolio growth; 50 table of contents the ability of our clients to access sufficient capital or their willingness to expend capital to fund network expansion or enhancements; our ability to continue to comply with covenants and the terms of our credit instruments; our ability to successfully refinance our indebtedness ahead of their maturity dates or anticipated repayment dates, on favorable terms, or at all; our ability to secure as many site leasing tenants as planned, including our ability to retain current leases on towers and deal with the impact, if any, of recent consolidation among wireless service providers; our ability to identify towers and land underneath towers that would be attractive to our clients and accretive to our financial results; and to negotiate and consummate agreements to acquire such towers and land; our ability to build 80-100 new towers in 2009; our ability to secure and deliver anticipated services business at contemplated margins; our ability to successfully and timely address zoning issues, permitting and other issues that arise in connection with the building of

providers in particular; the state of the credit markets and capital markets, including the level of volatility, illiquidity and interest rates that may affect our ability to pursue actions to manage our leverage position; the continued use of towers and dependence on outsourced site development services by the wireless communications industry; and our ability to successfully estimate certain accounting and tax matters, including the effect on our company of adopting certain accounting pronouncements and the availability of sufficient net operating losses to offset taxable income. non-gaap financial measures this report contains certain non-gaap measures, including adjusted ebitda and segment operating profit information. we have provided below a description of such non-gaap measures, a reconciliation of such non-gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures, an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures, their respective limitations and how management compensates for such limitations. adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding the impact of net interest expenses (including amortization of deferred financing fees), provision for

expenses (including in 2008 the $13.3 million other-than-temporary 51 table of contents impairment charge on our auction rate securities), non-recurring acquisition related integration costs associated with the optasite and light tower acquisitions, non-cash leasing revenue and non-cash ground lease expense. in addition, adjusted ebitda excludes acquisition related costs which are currently capitalized but, commencing january 1, 2009, is required to be expensed and included within operating expenses pursuant to the adoption of sfas 141(r). we have included this non-gaap financial measure because we believe this item is an indicator of the performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results. adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measurement of adjusted ebitda has certain material limitations, including: it does not include interest expense. because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits and cash flows. therefore, any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations, it does not include depreciation, accretion and amortization expense. because we use capital assets, depreciation, accretion and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits. therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation, accretion and amortization expense has material limitations, it does not include provision for taxes. because the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our costs, particularly in the future, any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations, and it does not include non-cash expenses such as asset impairment and other charges, non-cash compensation, other expenses/income, non-cash leasing revenue and non-cash ground lease expense. because these non-cash items are a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate profits, any measure that excludes these non-cash items has material limitations. we compensate for these limitations by using adjusted ebitda as only one of several comparative tools, together with gaap measurements, to assist in the evaluation of our profitability and operating results. the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda is as follows: for the year ended december 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) net loss $ (46,763 ) $ (77,879 ) $ (133,448 ) interest income (6,883 )

respectively. 52 table of contents segment operating profit each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues (excluding depreciation, accretion and amortization). total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the three segments. segment operating profit is, in our opinion, an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment, while excluding the impact of depreciation, accretion and amortization, which is largely fixed. segment operating profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or segment gross profit as determined in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measurement of segment operating profit has certain material limitations. specifically this measurement does not include depreciation, accretion and amortization expense. as we use capital assets in our business, depreciation, accretion and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profit. therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation, accretion and amortization expense has material limitations. we compensate for these limitations by using segment operating profit as only one of several comparative tools, together with gaap measurements, to assist in the evaluation of the operating performance of our segments. site leasing segment for the year ended december 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) segment revenue $ 395,541 $

factors 11 risk factors risks related to our business if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree, our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar. for example, in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel (to form verizon wireless), cingular and at&amp;t wireless (to form at&amp;t mobility) and sprint pcs and nextel (to form sprint nextel), the combined companies have or are considering rationalizing duplicative parts of their networks, which has led and may continue to lead to the non-renewal of certain leases on our towers. furthermore, to the extent that other wireless service providers consolidate in the future, they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers and/or may not lease as much space on our towers in the future. if these consolidations significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that the wireless service providers require to expand their network, our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space. wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider services. wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communication sites owned or controlled by us or others. the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue. we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue, therefore if any of our significant customers reduced their demand for tower space or became financially unstable it may materially decrease our revenues. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. the loss of any one of our significant customers, as a result of bankruptcy, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise, could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth. the following is a list of significant customers (representing at least 10% of revenue in any of the last three years) and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers: percentage of total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2007

have been restated due to 2009 merger of verizon and alltel revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts. each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant. however, if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty, substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us, our revenues, future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected. our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. in addition, a customer need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. furthermore, our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects. 12 table of contents increasing competition to acquire existing towers may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio long-term. we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio 5% to10% annually through acquisitions and new builds. our ability to meet these growth targets significantly depends on our ability to acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements. traditionally, our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies, independent tower developers and wireless service providers. however, as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these mid-sized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers. increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, higher acquisition prices, reduced willingness of sellers to accept equity as consideration for their towers and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers. furthermore, to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios, many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us. if we are not able to successfully address these challenges, we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the long-term. we have a substantial level of indebtedness, a large portion of which we will need to refinance in the next two years. in the event we are not able to refinance or repay such indebtedness, we may not be able to access the cash flow from all of our towers and we may need to take certain actions to service our debt obligations. as of december 31, 2009, we had $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding, of which $0.9 billion is scheduled to be repaid in 2011. the amount scheduled to be repaid in 2011 consists solely of the 2006 cmbs certificates which have an anticipated repayment date in november 2011. we do not currently expect to have sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the full principal amount of the 2006 cmbs certificates. consequently, we expect to refinance a significant portion of this debt. the global credit and capital markets are undergoing a period of substantial volatility and disruption, and the global economy is experiencing weakness and uncertainty. although the credit markets have improved during 2009, we believe that this volatile credit environment has generally resulted in increased interest rates and/or interest rate spread as compared to periods immediately prior to 2007. any renewed financial turmoil, worsening credit environment, economic weakness and uncertainty could impact our ability and the cost of refinancing our 2006 cmbs certificates. if we are unable to refinance the 2006 cmbs certificates by november 2011, the cash flow from the 3,746 tower sites pledged to secure such mortgage loan underlying the 2006 cmbs certificates, representing 45% of our total tower portfolio as of december 31, 2009, will be trapped and unavailable to service our other outstanding debt. if these cash flows become trapped, they would be applied first to repay the interest, at the original interest rate, on the mortgage loan components underlying the 2006 cmbs certificates, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with the pledged towers, third to pay the management fees, fourth to repay the principal of the 2006 cmbs certificates in the order of their investment grade, and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed below. as a result of this cash trap, we would only have access to the cash flow generated by the remaining approximately 4,578 tower sites (approximately 55% of our total tower portfolio as of december 31, 2009) and the annual management fee (equal to 7.5% of the operating revenues of the borrowers under the cmbs certificates for the immediately preceding calendar month) to service our other indebtedness and pay all other corporate expenses. furthermore, if we are unable to repay the mortgage loan components relating to the 2006 cmbs certificates by november 2011, then the interest rate on the mortgage loan underlying each subclass of the 2006 cmbs certificates would increase by the greater of (i) 5% or (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten year u.s. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for the mortgage loan component underlying the referenced subclass of the 2006 cmbs certificates (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component. such additional interest will be payable once the principal of the 2006 cmbs certificates is repaid. the sole remedy of the lenders if we do not refinance or repay the 2006 cmbs certificates by november 2011 is the cash trap and the increased interest rates 13 table of contents discussed above, but it is not an event of default under the mortgage loan, the indenture governing any of our outstanding notes or the senior credit agreement. if we are unable to refinance the 2006 cmbs certificates and therefore unable to access the cash flow from pledged towers, it may have an adverse impact on our ability to (i) repay our other indebtedness, or (ii) fund our planned capital expenditures, which would adversely affect our financial health and/or anticipated growth. recent developments in the global economy could result in a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space, which could adversely affect our future growth and revenues. due to the recent economic downturn and the resulting unemployment rates in the u.s. and internationally, consumer discretionary income has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted. if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use, or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications, our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services. as a result, they may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, the recent volatility and disruption of the global credit and capital markets may adversely affect: the financial condition of wireless service providers; the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures; and interest rates and the overall availability and cost of capital. as a result of these factors, wireless service providers may delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies, including 3g, 4g or other wireless services or, worse, elect not to renew existing antenna leases in order to reduce operating expenses. we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities. as indicated below, we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders equity as of december 31, 2008 and 2009. as of december 31, 2008 2009 (as adjusted) (in thousands) total principal amount of indebtedness $ 2,557,248 $ 2,771,012 shareholders equity $ 650,510 $ 599,949 our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal, interest or other amounts when due. subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured debt. this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage. as a consequence of our indebtedness, (1) demands on our cash resources may increase, (2) we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and (3) we may choose to institute self-imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our 14 table of contents relative leverage and our strategic plans. for example, as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the u.s. economy: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best long-term interests; we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments, including capital expenditures; we may, in the future, be required to reduce our annual tower acquisition and new build goals; we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry; we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged; and we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations. these restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. in addition, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur under our 2010 credit facility and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness, including our 2006 cmbs certificates at a commercially reasonable rate or at all. there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness. we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline. if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease, we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected. this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations. our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers. delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate. there can be no assurances that 3g, 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated. the deployment of 3g experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries, and deployment of 4g has been limited to date. additionally, the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated. 15 table of contents increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us. our industry is highly competitive, and our customers have numerous alternatives for leasing antenna space. some of our competitors, such as (1) national wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers and (2) large independent tower companies, are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us. this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers. in the site leasing business, we compete with: wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers; national and regional tower companies; and alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor das networks, billboards and electric transmission towers. we believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and, to a lesser extent, price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. however, competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. in addition, we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly. any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive. there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business. as a result of this competition, margins in this segment continue to be under pressure. many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable. if margins in this segment were to further decrease, our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected. if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results. our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues. for various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding title and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under a tower, which can affect our ability to access and operate a tower site. further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a future material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 16 table of contents our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. our current business operations in canada and our expansion into any other international markets in the future, could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not experienced in the united states. although the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were immaterial during the year ended december 31, 2009, we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations may grow in the future. accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including: changes in a specific country or region political or economic conditions; laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital; changes to existing or new tax laws directed specifically at the ownership and operation of tower sites; expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership; uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems, including inconsistencies between and within laws, regulations and decrees, and judicial application thereof; health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic; difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel; and language and cultural differences. in addition, we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. the market price of our class a common stock could be affected by significant volatility, which could adversely impact our ability to use equity to fund our growth plan. the market price of our class a common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations. since the fall of 2008, the u.s. stock market has been undergoing a period of very high volatility where changes in the market prices of equity securities have often been abrupt and profound over short periods of time. the market price of our class a common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed elsewhere in risk factors and in forward-looking statements. volatility or depressed market prices of our class a common stock could make it difficult for shareholders to resell their shares of class a common stock, when they want or at attractive prices. consequently, volatility of the market price of our class a common stock may make it less likely that sellers will accept our equity as consideration in connection with our tower acquisitions and may make it more difficult for us to use our equity to fund our future growth plans. if we were unable to use equity to fund the growth of our tower portfolio, we may be required to either use debt to increase our tower portfolio or reduce our anticipated growth. 17 table of contents counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to fulfill their obligations and such failure could subject us to significant costs to replace any such portion of our convertible note hedge transactions or subject us to potential dilution or additional cost, if settled in cash, upon conversion of our convertible notes. concurrently with the pricing of our 0.375% convertible senior notes due 2010 (the 0.375% notes ), our 1.875% convertible senior notes due 2013 (the 1.875% notes ), and our 4.0% convertible senior notes due 2014 (the 4.0% notes ), we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the convertible note offerings. the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 0.375% notes is $33.56 per share of our class a common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the 0.375% notes) and cover 10,429,720 shares of our class a common stock. as of december 31, 2009, the convertible note hedge transactions cover 2,559,185 shares of our class a common stock, as a result of repurchases and termination of $264.1million in principal of 0.375% notes and convertible note hedges. the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1.875% notes is $41.46 per share of our class a common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of our 1.875% convertible notes) and cover 13,265,780 shares of our class a common stock. the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 4.0% convertible notes is $30.38 per share of our class a common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the 4.0% notes) and cover 16,458,196 shares of our class a common stock. since the fall of 2008, global economic conditions and the financial markets have been and continue to be volatile. certain financial institutions have filed for bankruptcy, have sold some or all of their assets, or may be looking to enter into a merger or other transaction with another financial institution. as a result of these conditions, some of the counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to perform their obligations under such instruments. one of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with our 1.875% notes was with lehman brothers otc derivatives inc. ( lehman derivatives ) which covers 55% of the 13,265,780 shares of our class a common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of our 1.875% convertible notes. in october 2008, lehman derivatives filed a voluntary petition for protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code which constituted an event of default under the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives. as a result, on november 7, 2008 we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives. based on information available to us, we have no indication, as of the date of filing this form 10-k, that any party other than lehman derivatives would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us under the convertible note hedge transactions. if we were to elect to replace the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives or any other counterparty, we would incur significant costs to replace such hedge transactions. additionally, if we do not elect to replace our convertible note hedge transactions that were previously with lehman derivatives or any other counterparty fails to perform its obligations under our outstanding convertible note hedge transactions, we would be subject to potential dilution or additional cost, if settled in cash, upon conversion of the applicable 0.375% notes, 1.875% notes and 4.0% notes. we may not be able to build as many towers as we anticipate . we currently intend to build at least 120 to 140 new towers during 2010. however, our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction, our ability to locate, and acquire at commercially reasonable prices, attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits. due to these risks, it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated, the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2010. if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals. 18 table of contents our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility. our 2010 credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants. among other things, these covenants limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; sell assets; make certain investments; engage in mergers or consolidations; incur liens; and enter into affiliate transactions. these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, merger and acquisitions or other opportunities. if we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under the 2010 credit facility. in addition, if we default in the payment of our other indebtedness, including under our 2006 cmbs certificates and our notes, then such default could cause a cross-default under our 2010 credit facility. the mortgage loan relating to our 2006 cmbs certificates also contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum debt service coverage ratio. to the extent that the debt service coverage, as of the end of any calendar quarter, (1) is less than 1.30 times, all cash flow generated by the pledged towers must be deposited into a reserve account and (2) is less than 1.15 times, then an amortization period will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15 times for a calendar quarter. as lease payments from 3,746 tower sites of our total tower portfolio are pledged as collateral under the mortgage loan, if this cash flow was not available to us it could adversely impact our ability to pay our indebtedness, other than the mortgage loan, and to operate our business. new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations. the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers. for example, the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space. additionally, the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity, such as beam forming or smart antennae, that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space. the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require ground-based sites, such as the growth in delivery of video, voice and data services by satellites or other technologies, could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space. 19 table of contents our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business. we are a holding company with no business operations of our own. our only significant asset is, and is expected to be, the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. we conduct, and expect to continue conducting, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us. most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries, including the mortgage loan underlying the 2006 cmbs notes, the 2016 notes, the 2019 notes and any amounts that we may borrow under the 2010 credit facility. consequently, the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal, if any, under their respective indebtedness. other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our outstanding convertible notes, we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations. the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments. our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations. the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of long-term results. numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including: the timing and amount of our customers capital expenditures; the size and scope of our projects; the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers fiscal year; delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment; seasonal factors, such as weather, vacation days and total business days in a quarter; the use of third party providers by our customers; the rate and volume of wireless service providers network development; and general economic conditions. although the demand for our site development services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts. in addition, the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long. therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services. 20 table of contents we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses. we are not profitable. the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated: for the year ended december 31, 2007 2008 2009 (as adjusted) (as adjusted) (in thousands) net loss $ (91,474 ) $ (67,164 ) $ (141,119 ) our losses are principally due to depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, interest expense (including non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees), and losses from the extinguishment of debt as well as impairment charges on our towers and auction rate securities in the periods presented above. we expect to continue to incur significant losses, which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness. the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business. our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel. we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel. we have employment agreements with jeffrey a. stoops, our president and chief executive officer, kurt l. bagwell, our senior vice president and chief operating officer, thomas p. hunt, our senior vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t. cavanagh, our senior vice president and chief financial officer. we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel. if we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency ( rf ) energy. the government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy. exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects. the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. according to the federal communications commission (the fcc ), the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive. however, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. in particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services. moreover, if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business. we are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business. in particular, both the federal aviation administration ( faa ) and fcc regulate the construction, modification and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas. in addition, the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures. faa and fcc regulations govern construction, lighting, painting and marking of 21 table of contents towers and structures and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure, require registration of the tower or structure. certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages. certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements. failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply. in addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth. local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification. local regulations can delay, prevent, or increase the cost of new construction, co-locations, or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. in addition, new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations. our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters. our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes. we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. we also maintain third party liability insurance, subject to loss limits and deductibles, to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured, or damage to a significant number of our towers, could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes. as owner, lessee or operator of numerous tower sites, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. however, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have adopted anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. we adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes. these provisions, alone or in combination with each other, 22 table of contents may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future. the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986. we may also have a future ownership change, outside of our control, caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders. depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change, an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income. currently, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized. we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions, or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses. we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business. we also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses ( nols ) in u.s. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. generally, for u.s. federal and state tax purposes, nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years, and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire. we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future. we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority. we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority. if there are tax benefits, including from our use of nols or other tax attributes, that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority, we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities, which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, we may be limited in our ability to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes. we have substantial federal and state nols, including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as those generated through our historic business operations. in addition, we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities. to the extent we believe that a position with respect to an nol is not more likely than not to be sustained, we do not record the related deferred tax asset. in addition, for nols that meet the recognition threshold, we assess the recoverability of the nol and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol if recoverability is questionable. given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our nols, we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our nols. our ability to utilize our nols is also dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire. if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance. we review our uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance for our nols periodically and make adjustments from time to time, which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols. our nols are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols were incurred, and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our nols. if we are unable to use our nols or use of our nols is limited, we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our 23 table of contents deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equity-related offerings. sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market, including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of the notes, could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. we cannot predict the effect that future sales of our class a common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our class a common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 54 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business. the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and fair values associated with our long-term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness as of december 31, 2009: 2010 2011 2012 2013

date for the 2006 cmbs certificates is november 2036. our current primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk relating to (1) the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to refinance the 2006 cmbs certificates on its anticipated repayment date or at maturity at market rates, (2) our ability to meet financial covenants and (3) the impact of interest rate movements on any borrowings that we may incur under our 2010 credit facility, which are all floating rate. we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt. while we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis. special note regarding forward-looking statements this annual report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements concern expectations, beliefs, projections, plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. specifically, this annual report contains forward-looking statements regarding: our expectation that we will continue to incur losses; our expectations that site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional space on our towers due to increasing minutes of use, network expansion and network coverage requirements; our belief that our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal maintenance and non-discretionary capital expenditures; our expectations regarding the growth of our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications; our intent to grow our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, by 5% to 10% through opportunities that meet our investment criteria and are available at prices which we

expectations regarding the impact of our convertible note hedge transactions, and the termination of such transactions, with lehman derivatives; our intent and ability to continue to purchase and/or enter into long-term leases for the land that underlies our towers and the effect of such ground lease purchases on our margins and long-term financial condition; our estimates regarding certain accounting and tax matters, including the adoption of certain accounting pronouncements and the availability of sufficient net operating losses to offset future taxable income; and our use of the net proceeds from the our recent debt offerings. these forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. we wish to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. the most important factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals, and cause the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: our ability to successfully refinance our indebtedness ahead of their maturity dates or anticipated repayment dates, on favorable terms, or at all; our ability to sufficiently increase our revenues and maintain expenses and cash capital expenditures at appropriate levels to permit us to meet our anticipated uses of liquidity for operations and estimated portfolio growth; 55 table of contents the ability of our clients to access sufficient capital or their willingness to expend capital to fund network expansion or enhancements; our ability to continue to comply with covenants and the terms of our credit instruments; our ability to secure as many site leasing tenants as planned, including our ability to retain current leases on towers and deal with the impact, if any, of recent consolidation among wireless service providers; our ability to identify towers and land underneath towers that would be attractive to our clients and accretive to our financial results; and to negotiate and consummate agreements to acquire such towers and land; our ability to identify, acquire at acceptable prices and terms and integrate into our leasing business towers and tower assets, domestically and internationally, that meet our investment criteria and, to the extent that any such towers are located internationally, our ability to successfully manage the risks associated with international operations, including foreign exchange risk, currency restrictions and foreign regulatory and legal risks; our ability to build at least 120 to 140 new towers in 2010; our ability to secure and deliver anticipated services business at contemplated margins; our ability to successfully and timely address zoning issues, permitting and other issues that arise in connection with the building of new towers; our ability to realize economies of scale from our tower portfolio; the business climate for the wireless communications industry in general and the wireless communications infrastructure providers in particular; the state of the credit markets and capital markets, including the level of volatility, illiquidity and interest rates that may affect our ability to pursue actions to manage our leverage position; the continued use of towers and dependence on outsourced site development services by the wireless communications industry; and our ability to successfully estimate certain accounting and tax matters, including the effect on our company of adopting certain accounting pronouncements and the availability of sufficient net operating losses to offset taxable income.risk factors 9 risk factors risks related to our business if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree, our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar. for example, in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel (to form verizon wireless), cingular and at&amp;t wireless (to form at&amp;t mobility) and sprint pcs and nextel (to form sprint nextel), the combined companies have rationalized and may continue to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks, which has led and may continue to lead to the non-renewal of certain leases on our towers. furthermore, to the extent that other wireless service providers consolidate in the future, they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers and/or may not lease as much space on our towers in the future. if these consolidations significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that the wireless service providers require to expand their network, our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities. as indicated below, we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders equity as of december 31, 2009 and 2010. as of december 31, 2009 2010 (in thousands) total principal amount of indebtedness $ 2,771,012 $ 3,050,000 shareholders equity $ 599,949 $ 317,110 our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal, interest or other amounts when due. subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured debt. this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage. as a consequence of our indebtedness, (1) demands on our cash resources may increase, (2) we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and (3) we may choose to institute self-imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our relative leverage and our strategic plans. for example, as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the u.s. economy: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 9 table of contents we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best long-term interests; we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments, including capital expenditures; we may, in the future, be required to reduce our annual tower acquisition and new build goals; we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry; we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged; and we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations. these restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. in addition, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness, which we expect to incur under our 2010 credit facility and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all. there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness. we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue, therefore if any of our significant customers reduced their demand for tower space or became financially unstable it may materially decrease our revenues. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. the loss of any one of our significant customers, as a result of bankruptcy, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise, could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth. the following is a list of significant customers (representing at least 10% of revenue in any of the last three years) and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers: percentage of total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2008 2009 2010 at&amp;t (1) 23.1 % 23.8 % 23.9 % sprint (2) 25.0 %

been restated due to 2009 merger of verizon and alltel revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts. each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5-year periods at the option of the tenant. however, if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty, substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us, our revenues, future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected. our site development customers engage us on a project-by-project basis, and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty. in addition, a customer need for site development services can decrease, and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. furthermore, our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects. 11 table of contents new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations. the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers. for example, the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space. additionally, the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity, such as beam forming or smart antennae, that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space. the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require ground-based sites, such as the growth in delivery of video, voice and data services by satellites or other technologies, could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space. new technologies, including small cell technologies, that reduce the need for large antenna (or macro configurations ) could reduce our customers need to lease space on our communication sites. traditional macro-site installations currently are the source, and are expected to continue to be the source, of substantially all our site leasing revenue. our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. our current business operations in canada, costa rica, el salvador and panama and our expansion into any other international markets in the future, could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states. although the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were immaterial during the year ended december 31, 2010, we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations may grow in the future. accordingly, our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including: changes in a specific country or region political or economic conditions; laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital; laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our communications sites and conduct business, including zoning and environmental matters; changes to existing or new tax laws directed specifically at the ownership and operation of tower sites; expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership; the applicability of laws governing foreign operations including the foreign corrupt practices act and similar local anti-bribery laws; uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems, including inconsistencies between and within laws, regulations and decrees, and judicial application thereof; health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic; difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel; and language and cultural differences. the majority of our international operations are denominated in united states dollars. however, for some of our international operations, we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. our convertible note hedge transactions may not cover all of the potential dilution or additional cash outlay, if we settled the notes in cash, to which we may be subject upon conversion of the notes. concurrently with the pricing of our 1.875% convertible senior notes due 2013 (the 1.875% notes ) and our 4.0% convertible senior notes due 2014 (the 4.0% notes ) we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the convertible note offerings. the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1.875% notes is $41.46 per share of our class a common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of our 1.875% convertible notes) and the upper strike price of the warrants is $67.37 per share. the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 4.0% convertible notes is $30.38 per share of our class a common stock (the same as the initial conversion price of the 4.0% notes) and the upper strike price of the warrant transactions is $44.64 per share. initially we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions to cover the full amount of the shares that were issuable upon conversion of the 1.875% notes and the 4.0% notes. however, as a result of the global economic conditions in 2008, lehman brothers otc derivatives inc. ( lehman derivatives ), a counterparty to one of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with our 1.875% notes, filed a voluntary petition for protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code. as a result, on november 7, 2008, we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives which covered 55% of the 13,265,780 shares of our class a common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of our 1.875% notes. consequently, we do not currently have a hedge with respect to those shares and, to the extent that the market price of our class a common stock exceeds $41.46 per share upon conversion of the notes, we will be subject to dilution or if we settle in cash, additional costs, upon conversion of that portion of the 1.875% notes. if any of the other counterparties to our convertible hedge transactions were to default in their obligations, then our potential dilution or costs upon conversion of the respective notes would be materially increased. pursuant to the terms of the warrant transaction, we are responsible for the dilution or costs, to the extent that we settle in cash or stock, arising from the conversion of the notes to the extent that the market price of our class a common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. the strike price for the warrants covering 45% of the 1.875% notes is $67.37 per share and the strike price for the warrants covering the 4.0% notes is $44.64 per share. as of february 17, 2011, the closing sales price of our class a common stock was $43.66 per share. if the market price of our class a common stock significantly exceeded either of these strike prices on their respective conversion dates we would be subject to material dilution or, to the extent we elected to settle in cash, material additional costs. 12 table of contents increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio long-term. we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio 5% to 10% annually, domestically and internationally, through acquisitions and new builds. our ability to meet these growth targets significantly depends on our ability to acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements. traditionally, our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies, independent tower developers and wireless service providers. however, as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these mid-sized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers. increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, higher acquisition prices, and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers. furthermore, to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios, many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us. if we are not able to successfully address these challenges, we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the long-term. we currently intend to build at least 390 to 410 new towers, domestically and internationally, during 2011. however, our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction, our ability to locate, and acquire at commercially reasonable prices, attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits. furthermore, with respect to our international new builds, our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions, inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets. local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification. due to these risks, it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated, the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2011. if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals. a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues. if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use, or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications, our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services. regardless of consumer demand, each wireless service customer must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks. two wireless carriers that currently own nationwide spectrum positions have announced the intention to build nationwide networks, but have also announced that they do not have all of the necessary financing in place to complete such networks. as a result of all of the above, wireless carriers may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, other factors affecting the demand for our communication sites include: the impact of general economic conditions on consumers of wireless services; the impact of general economic conditions or regulatory policy on wireless service providers; the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures; and interest rates and the overall availability and cost of capital. as a result of these factors, wireless service providers may delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies, including 3g, 4g or other wireless services or, worse, elect not to renew existing antenna leases in order to reduce operating expenses. we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline. if wireless service provider demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease, we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected. this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy, revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations. our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers. 13 table of contents delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate. there can be no assurances that 3g, 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated. the deployment of 3g experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries, and deployment of 4g has been limited to date. additionally, the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated. our expansion initiatives may disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk. as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives, increased costs, undisclosed and assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to an acquisition. acquisitions involve substantial operating and financial risks and no assurance can be given as to our future success in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions. our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as complex laws, regulations and business practices that may require additional resources and personnel, as well as those risks described above in our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. furthermore, we began expanding our operations internationally relatively recently, and the success of our international operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to compete internationally with tower companies or wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks, that have been in the international market for a longer period of time. although we generally focus our international efforts in countries with relatively stable political and macroeconomic environments, growing, competitive wireless communications industries and multiple wireless carriers that are likely to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs to us, we are subject to several factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our expansion initiatives will succeed and not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 14 table of contents increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us. our industry is highly competitive, and our customers have numerous alternatives for leasing antenna space. some of our competitors, such as (1) u.s. and international wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers and (2) large independent tower companies, are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us. this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers. in the site leasing business, we compete with: wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers; national and regional tower companies; and alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor das networks, billboards and electric transmission towers. we believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market and, to a lesser extent, price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business. however, competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. in addition, we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly. any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 15 table of contents the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive. there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business. as a result of this competition, margins in this segment continue to be under pressure. many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable. if margins in this segment were to further decrease, our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected. if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results. our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. from time to time, we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for the land under our towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers. further, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a future material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. in addition, we may not always have the ability to analyze and verify all information regarding title, access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers. to the extent that we do not have complete access to, or use of, the land underlying the acquired towers, it could require us to incur additional expenses before we can operate and generate revenue from such tower. our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility. our 2010 credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants. among other things, these covenants limit our ability to: incur indebtedness above a certain level; 16 table of contents sell assets; make certain investments; engage in mergers or consolidations; incur liens; and enter into affiliate transactions. these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, merger and acquisitions or other opportunities. if we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under the 2010 credit facility. in addition, if we default in the payment of our other indebtedness, including under our 2010 tower securities and our notes, then such default could cause a cross-default under our 2010 credit facility. the mortgage loan relating to our 2010 tower securities also contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum debt service coverage ratio. to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30x or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers. the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15x as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an amortization period will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. as lease payments from 3,683 tower sites of our total tower portfolio are pledged as collateral under the mortgage loan, if this cash flow was not available to us it could adversely impact our ability to pay our indebtedness, other than the mortgage loan, and to operate our business. our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business . we are a holding company with no business operations of our own. our only significant asset is, and is expected to be, the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. we conduct, and expect to continue conducting, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us. most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries, including the mortgage loan underlying the 2010 tower securities, the 2016 notes, the 2019 notes and any amounts that we may borrow under the 2010 credit facility. consequently, the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal, if any, under their respective indebtedness. other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our outstanding convertible notes, we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations. the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments. 17 table of contents our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations. the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of long-term results. numerous factors cause these fluctuations, including: the timing and amount of our customers capital expenditures; the size and scope of our projects; the business practices of customers, such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers fiscal year; delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment; seasonal factors, such as weather, vacation days and total business days in a quarter; the use of third party providers by our customers; the rate and volume of wireless service providers network development; and general economic conditions. although the demand for our site development services fluctuates, we incur significant fixed costs, such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts. in addition, the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long. therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services. we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses. we are not profitable. the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated: for the year ended december 31, 2008 2009 2010 (in thousands) net loss $ (67,164 ) $ (141,119 ) $ (194,421 ) our losses are principally due to depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, interest expense (including non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees), and losses from the extinguishment of debt as well as impairment charges on our towers in the periods presented above. we expect to continue to incur significant losses, which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness. the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business. our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel. we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel. we have employment agreements with jeffrey a. stoops, our president and chief executive officer, kurt l. bagwell, our president - international, thomas p. hunt, our senior vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel, and brendan t. cavanagh, our senior vice president and chief financial officer. we do not have 18 table of contents employment agreements with any of our other key personnel. if we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business. we are subject to federal, state and local regulation of our business, both in the u.s. and internationally. in the u.s., both the federal aviation administration ( faa ) and the fcc regulate the construction, modification and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas. in addition, the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures. faa and fcc regulations govern construction, lighting, painting and marking of towers and structures and may, depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure, require registration of the tower or structure. certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking, painting and lighting. antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages. certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements. failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply. in addition, new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us, which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth. local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, vary greatly, but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification. local regulations can delay, prevent, or increase the cost of new construction, co-locations, or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. in addition, new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations. our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters. our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes. we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers, but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles. we also maintain third party liability insurance, subject to loss limits and deductibles, to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower. a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured, or damage to a significant number of our towers, could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. to the extent that we are not able to provide wireless services to our customers, due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances, our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses; however, we would be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower, including ground lease expenses. if we are unable to provide wireless services to our customers for a material portion of our towers, our operations could be materially and adversely affected. 19 table of contents we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes. as owner, lessee or operator of numerous tower sites, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. however, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have adopted anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. provisions of our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. we adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes. these provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock, or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions, or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses. we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business. we also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses ( nols ) in u.s. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. generally, for u.s. federal and state tax purposes, nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years, and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire. we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future. we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority. we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority. if there are tax benefits, including from our use of nols or other tax attributes, that are challenged successfully by a 20 table of contents taxing authority, we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities, which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, we may be limited in our ability to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes. we have substantial federal and state nols, including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as those generated through our historic business operations. in addition, we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities. to the extent we believe that a position with respect to an nol is not more likely than not to be sustained, we do not record the related deferred tax asset. in addition, for nols that meet the recognition threshold, we assess the recoverability of the nol and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol if recoverability is questionable. given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our nols, we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our nols. our ability to utilize our nols is also dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire. if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance. we review our uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance for our nols periodically and make adjustments from time to time, which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols. our nols are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols were incurred, and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our nols. if we are unable to use our nols or use of our nols is limited, we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equity-related offerings. sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market, including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of the notes, could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency ( rf ) energy. the u.s. government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy. exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects. the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. according to the federal communications commission (the fcc ), the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive. however, public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. in particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services. 21 table of contents moreover, if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects, including cancer, were demonstrated, we could be subject to numerous claims. if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy, even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future. the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986. we may also have a future ownership change, outside of our control, caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders. depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change, an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income. currently, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business. the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and fair values associated with our long-term debt

(2) the anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2010-2 tower securities is april 16, 2017 and april 16, 2042, respectively. our current primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk relating to (1) our ability to meet financial covenants and (2) the impact of interest rate movements on any borrowings that we may incur under our 2010 49 table of contents credit facility, which are at floating rates. we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt. while we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis. in addition, in connection with our convertible notes, we are subject to market risk associated with the market price of our common stock. special note regarding forward-looking statements this annual report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. these statements concern expectations, beliefs, projections, plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. specifically, this annual report contains forward-looking statements regarding: our expectations on the future growth and financial health of the wireless industry and the industry participants, and the drivers of such growth; our beliefs regarding our ability to capture and capitalize on industry growth and the impact of such growth on our financial and operational results; our expectations regarding the opportunities in the international wireless markets in which we currently operate or have targeted for growth, and our beliefs regarding how we can capitalize on such opportunities; our belief that our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures; our belief that our towers have significant capacity to accommodate additional tenants, that our tower operations are highly scalable, that we can add tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs, and the impact of these economies of scale on our cash flow and financial results; our intent to grow our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, by 5% to 10% in 2011, which would include building at least 390 to 410 new towers, domestically and internationally; our expectations that there will be towers available for acquisition that meet our investment criteria and are available at prices which we believe will be accretive to our shareholders and allow us to maintain our long-term target leverage ratios; our estimates of the impact of our ground lease purchase program on our financial results; our expectation that we will continue to incur losses; our expectations regarding our future cash capital expenditures, both discretionary and non-discretionary, including expenditures required to maintain, improve and modify our towers and general corporate expenditures; our estimates regarding our liquidity position in 2011 and our intended use of such liquidity; our expectations regarding the effectiveness of our convertible note hedge transactions to minimize the dilution and costs associated with our outstanding convertible notes; and our estimates regarding certain accounting and tax matters. 50 table of contents these forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. we wish to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. the most important factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals, and cause the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: developments in the wireless communications industry in general, and for wireless communications infrastructure providers in particular, that may slow growth or affect the willingness or ability of the wireless service providers to expend capital to fund network expansion or enhancements;
