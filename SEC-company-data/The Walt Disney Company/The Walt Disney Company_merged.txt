market risk............................................................... 37 market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and the fair market value of certain of its investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments. our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company's portfolio of borrowings. the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage, which is set by policy. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, revenues. the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities in the same principal currencies. the principal currencies hedged are the european euro, british pound, japanese yen and canadian dollar. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures for periods not to exceed five years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures. in addition, we use various financial instruments to minimize the exposure to changes in fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities. -37- it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk the company utilizes a "value-at-risk" (var) model to determine the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange and qualifying equity sensitive financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies and equity prices (a "variance/co-variance" technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at year-end and over each of the four quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during the year. the model includes all of the company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and qualifying equity investments. the values of foreign exchange options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currencies, as exchange rates vary. therefore, the hedge coverage assumed to be obtained from each option has been adjusted to reflect its respective sensitivity to changes in currency values. forecasted transactions, firm commitments and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the company's financial instruments at september 30, 2001 and 2000. the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):

instruments, due to the fact that the company has taken advantage of the current low interest rate environment by replacing variable rate debt with fixed-rate debt obligations. the market value of fixed-rate debt is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than floating-rate debt and accordingly, is driving the increase in the var. the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value,

large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: changes in u.s., global or regional economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a decrease in economic activity in the united states or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. a decline in economic conditions could reduce attendance and spending at one or more of our parks and resorts, purchase of or prices for advertising on our broadcast or cable networks or owned stations, prices that cable operators will pay for our cable programming, performance of our theatrical and home entertainment releases and purchases of company-licensed consumer products. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-united states markets or reduce the united states dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and reduce profitability. each of our businesses creates entertainment or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, theme park attractions, resort facilities and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. many of our businesses increasingly depend on worldwide acceptance of our offerings and products, and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the united states. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, theme park attractions or resort facilities before we learn the extent to which products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements -21- air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming, from theatrical film receipts or home video sales, from theme park admissions, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline and adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media and entertainment businesses in which we participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. in addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products and the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products. for example: the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats, including dvd players and personal video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies; technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options and if consumers favor options we have not yet fully developed rather than the entertainment products we offer, our sales may be adversely affected. the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. the success of our businesses is highly dependent on maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. new technologies such as peer-to-peer technology, high speed digital transmission (including digital distribution of theatrical films) and some features of digital video recorders have made infringement of our intellectual property in films and television programming easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. there is evidence that unauthorized use of intellectual property rights in the entertainment industry generally is a significant and rapidly growing phenomenon. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unauthorized use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of sales of unauthorized products. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services or impair our ability to provide or increase the cost of providing products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism as well as demand for other entertainment products can be significantly adversely affected in the united states, globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events, and others such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services. these events could therefore reduce our revenue or result in a reduction in demand for or ability to provide products and services or increase our costs to the extent damage is not covered by insurance or is subject to self-insurance. sustained increases in costs of pension and post-retirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with more than 133,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and post-retirement medical benefits. in recent years, we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including -22- increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on plan assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. at least some of these macro-economic factors may continue to put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we may also need to invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. macro-economic factors may impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. changes in u.s. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions and significant interest rate fluctuations, may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on the company performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, as well as newspaper, magazines, billboards and the internet. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. -23- our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, interactive and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to cable and satellite operators. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of united states and overseas regulations. these regulations include: united states fcc regulation of our television and radio networks and owned stations, including licensing of stations, ownership limits, prohibitions on indecent programming and restrictions on commercial time in children programming and regulation of our broadcasting businesses in non-united states markets. additional information regarding fcc regulation is provided in item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. environmental protection regulations. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulatory areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. -24- labor disputes may disrupt our operations and impair our profitability. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products may be covered by collective labor agreements with their employers. a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes with our employees may increase our costs. provisions in our corporate documents and delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to shareholders. our restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. the regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. the issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. in addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are influenced by advertiser demand and the seasonal nature of programming, and generally peak in the spring and fall. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months, when school vacations occur, and during early-winter and spring holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate based on the timing of theatrical motion picture, home entertainment and television releases. release dates for theatrical, home entertainment and television products are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the market. revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and the timing of animated theatrical releases and generally peak in our first fiscal quarter due to the holiday season. accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 63 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk " --> item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company maintains fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. it is the company policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at year end fiscal 2005. the model includes all of the company debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. -63- var on a combined basis decreased from $31 million at september 30, 2004 to $21 million at october 1, 2005. the majority of

euro disney and hong kong disneyland is immaterial as of october 1, 2005. in calculating the var it was determined that credit risks are the primary driver for changes in the value of euro disney debt rather than interest rate risks. accordingly, we have excluded euro disney borrowings from the var calculation.risk factors 17 risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. a decline in economic activity in the u.s. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. the most recent decline in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. a decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts or prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming. recent instability in european economies presents 16 table of contents risks of similar impacts in our european operations. economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-u.s. markets, or reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets, and economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. our businesses create entertainment, travel or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the u.s., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the u.s. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home video or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. in addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner and markets in which our products are distributed to consumers, the sources of competing television and filmed entertainment, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired markets. for example, the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats. these formats include web-based delivery of live and stored video entertainment, dvd players and digital video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies. such technologies may provide users the ability to fast-forward, rewind, pause and skip programming and advertisements. in addition, technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options and delivery vehicles, which fragments the market for our products. these developments have also led to an industry wide decline in ratings for broadcast television and to a reduction in demand for dvds of theatrical content and may disrupt traditional distribution models by enabling content owners to provide content directly to distributors and consumers, which could lead to decreased demand for content distributed on our broadcast or cable networks. in order to respond to these developments, we may be required to alter our business models and there can be no assurance that we will successfully respond to these changes or that the business models we develop in response to these changes will be as profitable as our current business models. as a result, the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products. the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. 17 table of contents the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, increased broadband internet speed and penetration and increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. the unauthorized use of intellectual property in the entertainment industry generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the company's operations worldwide, despite the company's efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed digital distribution of our content and sales of unauthorized dvds, blu-ray discs and other products. with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others, the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. the company is not aware of any challenges to its intellectual property rights that it currently foresees having a material effect on its operations. protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation. we maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. if our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the u.s., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. for example, the earthquake and tsunami in japan in march 2011 resulted in a period of suspension of our operations and those of certain of our licensees in japan, including tokyo disney resort and resulted in a loss of revenue from those operations. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, that could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and liability for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. 18 table of contents changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. in recent years, such investments have included expansion and repurposing of certain of our theme park attractions and participation in a joint venture that is constructing a theme park in shanghai, china. some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. past disruptions in the u.s. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in significant part, on the company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts. increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and the internet, as well as with newspapers, magazines and billboards. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. our interactive game operations compete with other publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with approximately 175,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic 19 table of contents factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding contributions. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to mvpds. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the terms on which we distribute programming (including the breadth of distribution by a carrier) may reduce revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of u.s. and overseas regulations. these regulations include: u.s. fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. environmental protection regulations. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. our operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than u.s. law. laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the u.s., and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under u.s. law. moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. in addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or united states anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. as a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-u.s. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if u.s. law governed these operations. labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. 20 table of contents provisions in our corporate documents and delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control. our restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. the regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. the issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. in addition, provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation require supermajority shareholder approval of some acquisition transactions and we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law, either of which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met. these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company's fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during that period. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the company's first fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. revenues in our interactive segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases, which are determined by several factors, including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends. accordingly, if a short-term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. the company's acquisition of lucasfilm is expected to cause short-term dilution in earnings per share and there can be no assurance that anticipated improvements in earnings per share will be realized. on december 21, 2012, the company acquired lucasfilm ltd. llc in a merger transaction in which the company distributed 37.1 million shares and paid $2.2 billion in cash. we expect that the merger will initially result in lower earnings per share than we would have earned in the absence of the merger. we expect that over time the merger will yield benefits to the combined company such that the merger will ultimately be accretive to earnings per share. however, there can be no assurance that the increase in earnings per share expected in the long term will be achieved. in order to achieve increases in earnings per share as a result of the merger, the combined company will, among other things, need to effectively continue the successful operations of lucasfilm after the merger, develop successful new content (including future feature films) based on lucasfilm's intellectual property and successfully integrate lucasfilm's products into the combined company's various distribution channels. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company's exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company's portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. the economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at fiscal year end. the model includes all of the company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. 47 table of contents the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis decreased to $63 million at september 28, 2013 from $79 million at september 29, 2012. the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): fiscal year 2013 interest rate sensitive financial instruments currency sensitive financial instruments equity sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio year end var $ 60 $ 29 $ 17 $ 63 average var $ 50 $ 36

materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. a decline in economic activity in the u.s. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. the most recent decline in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. a decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming. recent instability in european economies has had similar impacts on some of our european operations. economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-u.s. markets, or reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets, and economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our

may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. 17 table of contents changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. new technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. this trend has disrupted and challenged the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content and the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming. in order to respond to these developments, we may be required to alter our business models and there can be no assurance that we will successfully respond to these changes, that we will not experience disruption as we develop responses to the changes, or that the business models we develop will be as profitable as our current business models. as a result, the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products. the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, increased broadband internet speed and penetration and increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission have made the unauthorized digital copying and

distribution of our content. with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others, the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation. we maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. if our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident. 18 table of contents a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the u.s., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, that could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. in recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme park attractions and investment in shanghai disney resort. some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. past disruptions in the u.s. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in part, on the company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts. increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home entertainment products and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and the internet, as well as with newspapers, magazines and billboards. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. 19 table of contents our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. our consumer products segment competes with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. our interactive game operations compete with other publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. competition in each of these areas may increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. increased competition may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with approximately 180,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the terms on which we distribute programming (including the breadth of distribution by a carrier) may reduce revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of u.s. and overseas regulations. these regulations include: u.s. fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. environmental protection regulations. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. 20 table of contents domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. our operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than u.s. law. laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the u.s., and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under u.s. law. moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. in addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or united states anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. as a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-u.s. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if u.s. law governed these operations. labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the company's first fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. revenues in our interactive segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases, which are determined by several factors, including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends. accordingly, if a short-term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 54 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company's exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company's portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. the economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at fiscal year end. the model 54 table of contents includes all of the company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis decreased to $51 million at september 27, 2014 from $63 million at september 28, 2013 . the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): fiscal year 2014 interest rate sensitive financial instruments currency sensitive financial instruments equity sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio year end var $ 34 $ 30 $ 11 $ 51 average var $ 35 $ 27 $ 8 $ 47 highest var $ 37 $ 30 $ 11 $ 51 lowest var $ 34 $ 19 $ 6 $ 42 beginning of year var (year end fiscal 2013) $ 60 $ 29 $ 17 $ 63 the var for disneyland paris and hong kong disneyland resort is immaterial as of september 27, 2014 and has been excluded from the above table.risk factors 16 risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. a decline in economic activity in the u.s. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. a decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming. recent instability in non-u.s. economies has had similar impacts on some of our u.s. operations. economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-u.s. markets, and recent changes have reduced the u.s. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets. economic or political conditions in a country could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. our businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the u.s., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the u.s. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home entertainment or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. new technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. this trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for certain of our networks. in order to respond to these developments, we may be required to alter our business models and there can be no assurance that we will successfully respond to these changes, that we will not experience disruption as we develop responses to the changes, or that the business models we develop will be as profitable as our current business models. as a result, the income from our 16 table of contents entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products. the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, increased broadband internet speed and penetration and increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. the unauthorized use of intellectual property in the entertainment industry generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the company's operations worldwide, despite the company's efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content. with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others, the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation. we maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. we develop and maintain systems in an effort to prevent intrusion, tampering and theft, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. accordingly, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where we believe appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. if our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the u.s., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those 17 table of contents third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, that could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. in recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme park attractions and investment in shanghai disney resort. some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. past disruptions in the u.s. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in part, on the company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts. increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home entertainment products, new sources of broadband delivered content and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and internet delivered content, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks compete to obtain creative and performing talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support and market share with other studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and new sources of broadband delivered content. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our consumer products segment competes with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. our interactive media operations compete with other publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. 18 table of contents competition in each of these areas may increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. increased competition may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with approximately 185,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, may demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of u.s. and overseas regulations. these regulations include: u.s. fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. environmental protection regulations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international wage laws, tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable. our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. our operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than u.s. law. laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the u.s., and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be 19 table of contents expected under u.s. law. moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. in addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or united states anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. as a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-u.s. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if u.s. law governed these operations. labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. revenues in our consumer products and interactive media segments are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the company's first fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. accordingly, if a short-term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 53 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company's exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company's portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. the economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at each fiscal quarter end. the model includes all of the company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis increased to $65 million at october 3, 2015 from $51 million at september 27, 2014 . 53 table of contents the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): fiscal year 2015 interest rate sensitive financial instruments currency sensitive financial instruments equity sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio year end fiscal 2015 var $ 61 $ 44 $ 2 $ 65 average var $ 58 $ 43 $ 6 $ 62 highest var $ 68 $ 44 $ 10 $ 72 lowest var $ 49 $ 41 $ 2 $ 49 year end fiscal 2014 var $ 34 $ 30 $ 11 $ 51 the var for disneyland paris, hong kong disneyland resort and shanghai disney resort is immaterial as of october 3, 2015 and has been excluded from the above table.risk factors 15 risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: 15 table of contents changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. a decline in economic activity in the u.s. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. a decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming. recent instability in non-u.s. economies has had some of these and similar impacts on some of our domestic and overseas operations. economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-u.s. markets, and recent changes have reduced the u.s. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets. economic or political conditions in a country could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. our businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the u.s., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the u.s. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home entertainment or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. new technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. this trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels across the industry, including for a number of our networks. in order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models and there can be no assurance that we will successfully respond to these changes, that we will not experience disruption as we respond to the changes, or that the business models we develop will be as profitable as our current business models. as a result, the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products. 16 table of contents the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. the unauthorized use of our intellectual property may increase the cost of protecting rights in our intellectual property or reduce our revenues. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, increased broadband internet speed and penetration and increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. the unauthorized use of intellectual property in the entertainment industry generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the company's operations worldwide, despite the company's efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content. with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others, the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation. we maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. we develop and maintain systems in an effort to prevent intrusion, tampering and theft, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. accordingly, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where we believe appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. if our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the u.s., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, 17 table of contents generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise decide to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including changing technology, changing consumer patterns, acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. in recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme park attractions and investment in shanghai disney resort. some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. past disruptions in the u.s. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in part, on the company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs, could affect our ability to settle existing contracts and could also affect the ability of our business customers to obtain financing and thereby to satisfy their obligations to us. increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home entertainment products, new sources of broadband and mobile delivered content and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and internet and mobile delivered content, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks compete to obtain creative and performing talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support and market share with other studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and new sources of broadband delivered content. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our consumer products &amp; interactive media segment competes with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. our interactive media operations compete with other licensors and publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. 18 table of contents competition in each of these areas may increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. increased competition may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with approximately 195,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, may demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by recent consolidation in the market for program distribution. with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of u.s. and overseas regulations. these regulations include: u.s. fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. environmental protection regulations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international wage laws, tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable. 19 table of contents our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. our operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than u.s. law. laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the u.s. these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under u.s. law. moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. in addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or united states anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. as a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-u.s. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if u.s. law governed these operations. labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance

during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company's exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company's portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. the economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities

and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis increased to $113 million at october 1, 2016 from $109 million at october 3, 2015 . 51 table of contents

company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with 14 table of contents the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. a decline in economic activity in the u.s. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. a decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming. recent instability in non-u.s. economies has had some of these and similar impacts on some of our domestic and overseas operations. economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-u.s. markets, and recent changes have reduced the u.s. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets. economic or political conditions in a country could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. our businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the u.s., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the u.s. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, acquisition of sports rights, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts, from sales of distribution rights to other distributors or home entertainment or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. new technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. this trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels across the industry, including for a number of our networks. in order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models and there can be no assurance that we will successfully respond to these changes, that we will not experience disruption as we respond to the changes, or that the business models we develop will be as profitable as our current business models. as a result, the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products. 15 table of contents the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. the unauthorized use of our intellectual property may increase the cost of protecting rights in our intellectual property or reduce our revenues. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, increased broadband internet speed and penetration, increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. the unauthorized use of intellectual property in the entertainment industry generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the company's operations worldwide, despite the company's efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content. with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others, the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation. we maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. we develop and maintain systems in an effort to prevent intrusion, tampering and theft, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. accordingly, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where we believe appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. if our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the u.s., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. an incident that affected our property directly would have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could have an extended effect of discouraging consumers from attending our facilities. moreover, the costs of protecting against such incidents reduces the profitability of our operations. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if 16 table of contents negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise decide to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including changing technology, changing consumer patterns, acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. in recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme park attractions, investment in shanghai disney resort and investments related to direct-to-consumer offerings of sports and other entertainment products. some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. past disruptions in the u.s. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in part, on the company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs, could affect our ability to settle existing contracts and could also affect the ability of our business customers to obtain financing and thereby to satisfy their obligations to us. increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home entertainment products, new sources of broadband and mobile delivered content and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations. in addition, we increasingly face competition for advertising sales from internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks compete to obtain creative and performing talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support and market share with other studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and new sources of broadband delivered content. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our consumer products &amp; interactive media segment competes with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. 17 table of contents our interactive media operations compete with other licensors and publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. competition in each of these areas may increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. increased competition may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with approximately 199,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, may demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by recent consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of u.s. and overseas regulations. these regulations include: u.s. fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. environmental protection regulations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international wage laws, tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable. 18 table of contents our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. our operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than u.s. law. laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the u.s. these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under u.s. law. moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. in addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or united states anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. as a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-u.s. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if u.s. law governed these operations. labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. revenues in our consumer products &amp; interactive media segments are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the company's first fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts. accordingly, if a short-term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. 47 table of contents policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company's exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company's portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. the economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at each fiscal quarter end. the model includes all of the company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis decreased to $92 million at september 30, 2017 from $113 million at october 1, 2016 . 48 table of contents the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): fiscal year 2017 interest rate sensitive financial instruments currency sensitive financial instruments equity sensitive financial instruments commodity sensitive financial instruments combined

disneyland resort and shanghai disney resort is immaterial as of september 30, 2017 and accordingly has been excluded from the above table.risk factors 14 risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: 14 table of contents changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. a decline in economic activity in the u.s. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. a decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming. economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-u.s. markets, and recent changes have reduced the u.s. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets. economic or political conditions in a country could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. our businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create filmed entertainment and television programming, which may be distributed among other ways through broadcast, cable, internet or cellular technology, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the u.s., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the u.s. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, television programming, acquisition of sports rights, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air), from affiliate fees, from subscription fees, from theatrical film receipts, from the license of rights to other distributors, from theme park admissions, from hotel room charges and merchandise, from food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services, may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. new technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. this trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels, including for a number of our networks. in order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models, most recently by developing dtc products for certain sports programming on espn+ (launched in 2018) and for filmed entertainment and other programming on disney+ (to be launched in 2019). there can be no assurance that our dtc offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes, and we expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources in the short term. there can be no assurance that the dtc model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be as profitable as our current business models. the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or 15 table of contents interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from

incur costs to remediate possible harm to our customers and employees and/or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the u.s., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse

alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. this includes competition for human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our studio operations and media businesses compete to obtain creative, performing and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support and market share with other studio operations, broadcast and cable networks, svod providers, and other new sources of broadband delivered content. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations. in addition, we increasingly face competition for advertising sales from internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our interactive media operations compete with other licensors and publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. competition in each of these areas may increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. increased competition may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services or deprive us of talent necessary to produce high quality creative material. such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. past disruptions in the u.s. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in part, on the company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs, could affect our ability to settle existing contracts and could also affect the ability of our business customers to obtain financing and thereby to satisfy their obligations to us. 17 table of contents sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with approximately 201,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, may demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by recent consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of u.s. and overseas regulations. these regulations include: u.s. fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. see item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. environmental protection regulations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international wage laws, tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable. our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. our operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than u.s. law. laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the u.s. these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under u.s. law. moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. in addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or united states anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. as a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-u.s. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if u.s. law governed these operations. 18 table of contents labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. revenues in our consumer products &amp; interactive media segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the company's first and fourth fiscal quarters, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts. accordingly, if a short-term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. risk factors related to the acquisition of 21cf the proposed acquisition of 21cf may cause disruption in our business. the merger agreement related to the acquisition of 21cf (the acquisition ) restricts us from taking certain specified actions without 21cf's consent until the acquisition is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, including making certain acquisitions to the extent that the acquisition would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the completion of the acquisition, and from paying dividends in excess of certain thresholds. these restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the proposed acquisition could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on results of operations. parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties. the pursuit of the acquisition and the preparation for the integration of 21cf may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources. the diversion of management's attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results. we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the acquisition. we may also incur unanticipated costs in the integration of the businesses of 21cf and disney. the substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses relating to the acquisition, and many of these costs are payable regardless of whether or not the acquisition is consummated. we also could be subject to litigation related to the proposed acquisition, which could result in significant costs and expenses. failure to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, as well as our future business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we currently anticipate the acquisition will be completed in the first half of calendar year 2019, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions for the acquisition will be satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived. the acquisition cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived, including (i) receipt of certain required governmental approvals and consents, (ii) receipt by 21cf of a surplus and solvency opinion with 19 table of contents respect to the separation of the 21cf assets and liabilities that we are not acquiring in the acquisition, referred to as the separation, and the cash dividend in connection with the acquisition, (iii) the registration of the common stock of a newly formed subsidiary of 21cf, referred to as new fox, that is contemplated to own the 21cf assets and liabilities that we are not acquiring in the acquisition and which will be spun off to 21cf stockholders, (iv) authorization of disney and new fox shares for listing on nyse or nasdaq, as applicable, (v) the consummation of the separation and spin off of new fox to 21cf stockholders, (vi) receipt of certain tax opinions by each of 21cf and disney, including tax opinions regarding the intended tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and (vii ) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by 21cf or disney, as applicable, in the merger agreement. our obligation to complete the acquisition is also subject to, among other conditions, the absence of regulatory authorities requiring certain actions on our part. the satisfaction of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. further, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the acquisition will be completed. if the acquisition is not completed in a timely manner or at all, our business may be adversely affected as follows: we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, and our stock price could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the acquisition will be completed; we may experience negative reactions from employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties; management's focus may have been diverted from pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to disney; and our costs of pursuing the acquisition may be higher than anticipated. in addition to the above risks, we may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay 21cf a termination fee equal to $1.525 billion, or in connection with a termination under certain specified circumstances in connection with the failure to obtain regulatory approvals, $2.5 billion. if the acquisition is not consummated, there can be no assurance that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our stock price, business, financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows. the acquisition may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. we currently expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share, excluding the impact of purchase accounting, in fiscal 2021 assuming the acquisition closes in fiscal 2019. this expectation, however, is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. in addition, we could fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition or experience delays or inefficiencies in realizing such benefits. such factors could, combined with the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition, result in the acquisition being dilutive to our earnings per share, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. in order to complete the acquisition, disney and 21cf must obtain certain governmental approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions, completion of the acquisition may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could be reduced. although disney and 21cf have agreed to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings and obtain the required governmental approvals or expiration or earlier termination of relevant waiting periods, as the case may be, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or be terminated or that the relevant approvals will be obtained. as a condition to approving the acquisition, these governmental authorities may impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the acquisition. there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the acquisition or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the acquisition, or otherwise adversely affecting, including to a material extent, our businesses and results of operations after completion of the acquisition. if we or 21cf are required to divest assets or businesses, there can be no assurance that we or 21cf will be able to negotiate such divestitures expeditiously or on favorable terms or that the governmental authorities will approve the terms of such divestitures. we can provide no assurance that these conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the abandonment of the acquisition. we will be required to divest the 21cf regional sports networks (the 21cf rsns ) and we may not be able to negotiate such divestitures expeditiously or on favorable terms. on june 27, 2018, the u.s. department of justice (the doj ) submitted a proposed final judgment resolving a complaint it filed the same day to remedy potential competitive concerns regarding our acquisition of the 21cf rsns. pursuant to the doj's proposed final judgment, we will be required to hold separate and divest the 21cf rsns following the completion of the acquisition if the divestiture of the 21cf rsns is not completed prior to the completion of the acquisition. the proposed final 20 table of contents judgment is subject to the approval of the united states district court for the southern district of new york. there can be no assurance that such court approval will be granted. although we intend to fully comply with the proposed final judgment, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate such divestitures expeditiously or on favorable terms, or that governmental authorities will approve the terms of such divestitures. in the event that we are unable to divest all of the 21cf rsns within the agreed upon time periods, the doj may apply for a trustee to be appointed to give effect to the divestitures, and we will be unable to object to any sale of the 21cf rsns by the trustee on any grounds other than the trustee's malfeasance. although we expect that the acquisition will result in synergies and other benefits to us, we may not realize those benefits because of difficulties related to integration, the achievement of synergies, and other challenges. disney and 21cf have operated and, until completion of the acquisition, will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that our businesses can be combined in a manner that allows for the achievement of substantial benefits. if we are not able to successfully integrate 21cf's businesses with ours or pursue our direct-to-consumer strategy successfully, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer than expected to be realized. further, it is possible that there could be loss of key disney or 21cf employees, loss of customers, disruption of either company's or both companies' ongoing businesses or unexpected issues, higher than expected costs and an overall post-completion process that takes longer than originally anticipated. specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in combining the operations of 21cf with ours in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition so the combined company performs as the parties hope: combining the companies' corporate functions; combining the businesses of disney and 21cf in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the acquisition, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all; maintaining existing agreements with customers, distributors, providers, talent and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, providers, talent and vendors; determining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies; integrating the companies' administrative and information technology infrastructure; developing products and technology that allow value to be unlocked in the future; and effecting potential actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals. in addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management and resources may be focused on completion of the acquisition and integration planning of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our ongoing business and the business of the combined company. consummation of the acquisition will increase our exposure to the risks of operating internationally. we are a diversified entertainment company that offers entertainment, travel and consumer products worldwide. although many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside of the u.s., the combination with 21cf will increase the importance of international operations to our future operations, growth and prospects. the risks of operating internationally that we already face may therefore increase upon completion of the acquisition. our consolidated indebtedness will increase substantially following completion of the acquisition. this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility. our consolidated indebtedness as of september 29, 2018 was approximately $20.9 billion. upon completion of the acquisition, we will assume an estimated $19 billion of additional outstanding debt of 21cf. in addition, we have obtained a bridge commitment of up to $35.7 billion and may draw on such facility or other bridge facilities, issue additional commercial paper, or obtain other debt financing in order to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition. we expect to use a portion of 21cf's cash to repay a portion of the increased indebtedness promptly after completion of the acquisition, and use proceeds from the sale of the 21cf rsns (as defined below) to repay additional indebtedness when those proceeds become available. following the completion of these transactions, we expect that the combined company will have approximately $40 billion of short and long-term debt and interest expense of approximately $2 billion per year. the increased indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. in addition, the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels will increase following completion of the acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than prior to the acquisition. the increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the acquisition could also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends, and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. our financial flexibility may be further constrained by the issuance of shares of common stock in the acquisition, because of dividend payments. 21 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. 51 table of contents policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company's exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company's portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, japanese yen, british pound, chinese yuan and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. the economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at each fiscal quarter end. the model includes all of the company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis decreased to $44 million at september 29, 2018 from $92 million at september 30, 2017 driven by a reduction in unhedged fixed-rate borrowings, lower interest rate volatility of our debt, and a reduction in the net notional value of our foreign exchange derivative contracts. 52 table of contents the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): fiscal year 2018 interest rate

factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a decrease in economic activity in the united states or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. a decline in economic conditions could reduce attendance and spending at one or more of our parks and resorts, purchase of or prices for advertising on our broadcast or cable networks or owned stations, prices that cable operators will pay for our cable programming, performance of our theatrical and home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-licensed consumer products. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-united states markets, or reduce the united states dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and reduce profitability. each of our businesses creates entertainment or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, theme park attractions, resort facilities, and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. many of our businesses increasingly depend on worldwide acceptance of our offerings and products, and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the united states. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, theme park attractions, or resort facilities before we learn the extent to which products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming, from theatrical film receipts or home video sales, from theme park admissions and resort room, food, and beverage charges, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products, and services may decline and adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media and entertainment businesses in which we participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. in addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired markets. for example: the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats, including dvd players and personal video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies, including web-based delivery of entertainment offerings; -20- table of contents technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options and if consumers favor options we have not yet fully developed rather than the entertainment products we offer, our sales may be adversely affected. the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. the success of our businesses is highly dependent on maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. new technologies such as peer-to-peer technology, high speed digital transmission (including digital distribution of theatrical films) and some features of digital video recorders have made infringement of our intellectual property in films and television programming easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. there is evidence that unauthorized use of intellectual property rights in the entertainment industry generally is a significant and rapidly growing phenomenon. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unauthorized use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of sales of unauthorized products. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services or impair our ability to provide or increase the cost of providing products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the united states, globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events, and others such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. due to recent weather events, we are currently limited in the extent of insurance we can obtain for wind damage and are carrying more self-insurance with respect to this risk than we have in the past. sustained increases in costs of pension and post-retirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with more than 133,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and post-retirement medical benefits. in recent years, we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities may affect our costs in some years. at least some of these macro-economic factors may continue to put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we may also need to invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. -21- table of contents the company acquisition of pixar will cause short term dilution in earnings per share and there can be no assurance that anticipated improvements in earnings per share will be realized. on may 5, 2006 (the closing date), the company completed its all stock acquisition of pixar. to purchase pixar, disney exchanged 2.3 shares of its common stock for each share of pixar common stock resulting in the issuance of 279 million shares of disney common stock and converted previously issued vested and unvested pixar equity-based awards into approximately 45 million disney equity-based awards. the transaction resulted in lower earnings per share in fiscal 2006 than would have been earned by the company in the absence of the transaction and this dilution is expected to continue in fiscal 2007 and possibly in future years. in addition, the issuance of shares in connection with the transaction has decreased the aggregate voting power of the company pre-transaction shareholders. the company expects that over time the transaction will yield benefits to the company such that the transaction will ultimately be accretive to earnings per share. however, there can be no assurance that the increase in earnings per share expected in the longer term will be achieved. in order to achieve increases in earnings per share as a result of the acquisition, the company will, among other things, need to effectively continue the successful operations of pixar after the acquisition, develop successful sequels to prior pixar productions, and improve the overall performance of the disney feature animation business. macro-economic factors may impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. changes in u.s. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions and significant interest rate fluctuations, may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on the company performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, as well as newspaper, magazines, billboards and the internet. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, interactive and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. -22- table of contents competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to cable and satellite operators. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of united states and overseas regulations. these regulations include: united states fcc regulation of our television and radio networks and owned stations, including licensing of stations, ownership limits, prohibitions on indecent programming and restrictions on commercial time in children programming and regulation of our broadcasting businesses in non-united states markets. additional information regarding fcc regulation is provided in item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. environmental protection regulations. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulatory areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. labor disputes may disrupt our operations and impair our profitability. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products may be covered by collective labor agreements with their employers. a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes with our employees may increase our costs. -23- table of contents provisions in our corporate documents and delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to shareholders. our restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. the regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. the issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. in addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are influenced by advertiser demand and the seasonal nature of programming, and audience viewership generally peaks in the winter months. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months, when school vacations occur, and during early-winter and spring holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate based on the timing of theatrical motion picture, home entertainment, and television releases. release dates for theatrical, home entertainment, and television products are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the market. revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and the timing of animated theatrical releases and generally peak in our first fiscal quarter due to the holiday season. accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 58 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company maintains fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency -58- table of contents revenues. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen, and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. it is the company policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at fiscal 2006 year end. the model includes all of the company debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis was $21 million at september 30, 2006 and october 1, 2005. the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): fiscal year 2006 interest rate sensitive financial instruments currency sensitive financial instruments equity sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio year end var $ 22 $ 10 $ 1 $ 21 average var $ 19 $ 13 $ 0 $ 22 highest var $ 22 $ 15 $ 1 $ 24 lowest var $ 18 $ 10 $ 0 $ 18 beginning of year var (year end fiscal 2005) $ 24 $ 12 $ 1 $ 21 the var for euro disney and hong kong disneyland is immaterial as of september 30, 2006. in calculating the var it was determined that credit risks are the primary driver for changes in the value of euro disney debt rather than interest rate risks. accordingly, we have excluded euro disney borrowings from the above var calculation.risk factors 18 risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a decrease in economic activity in the united states or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. a decline in economic conditions could reduce attendance and spending at one or more of our parks and resorts, purchase of or prices for advertising on our broadcast or cable networks or owned stations, prices that cable operators will pay for our cable programming, performance of our theatrical and home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-united states markets, or reduce the united states dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets. 18 table of contents labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. collective bargaining agreements with guilds and unions representing writers, directors, actors, technicians and others either have expired or are scheduled to expire during fiscal 2008, and negotiations with some of these guilds and unions have taken place, are scheduled or are underway. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. on november 5, 2007, members of the writers guild of america commenced a work stoppage. on november 10, 2007, members of local one of the international alliance of theatrical stage employees commenced a work stoppage affecting one of the company theatrical productions in new york city. the company does not currently expect this work stoppage to have a material impact on the company financial results. with respect to the work stoppage by the writers guild of america, if this or another work stoppage by unions involved in the production of television or film programming is prolonged, we may be unable to produce or air original programming or produce and distribute new theatrical releases, either of which could result in reduced revenue. while we would pursue measures to mitigate the impact of a sustained work stoppage through alternative programming and reduction of costs, we expect that a continued work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our profitability. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. each of our businesses creates entertainment or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, theme park attractions, resort facilities and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. many of our businesses increasingly depend on worldwide acceptance of our offerings and products, and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the united states. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, theme park attractions, or resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming, from theatrical film receipts or home video sales, from theme park admissions, resort room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline and adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media and entertainment businesses in which we participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. in addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired markets. for example: the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats, including dvd players and personal video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies, including web-based delivery of entertainment offerings; technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options and if consumers favor options we have not yet fully developed rather than the entertainment products we offer, our sales may be adversely affected. 19 table of contents the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. the success of our businesses is highly dependent on maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, and increased broadband internet speed and penetration have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. there is evidence that unauthorized use of intellectual property rights in the entertainment industry generally is a significant and rapidly growing phenomenon. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unauthorized use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unauthorized digital distribution of our content and sales of unauthorized dvds and other counterfeit products. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the united states, globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees they could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some but not all of these events, and when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions and caps. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we may also need to invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. macro-economic factors may impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. changes in u.s. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions and significant interest rate fluctuations, may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on the company performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. 20 table of contents increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, as well as newspaper, magazines, billboards and the internet. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, interactive and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with more than 137,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. in some recent years, we experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. at least some of these macro-economic factors may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to cable and satellite operators. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. 21 table of contents changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of united states and overseas regulations. these regulations include: united states fcc regulation of our television and radio networks and owned stations, including licensing of stations, ownership limits, prohibitions on indecent programming and restrictions on commercial time in children programming and regulation of our broadcasting businesses in non-united states markets. additional information regarding fcc regulation is provided in item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. environmental protection regulations. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulatory areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. the company acquisition of pixar causes short term dilution in earnings per share and there can be no assurance that anticipated improvements in earnings per share will be realized. on may 5, 2006, the company completed its all stock acquisition of pixar. to purchase pixar, disney exchanged 2.3 shares of its common stock for each share of pixar common stock, resulting in the issuance of 279 million shares of disney common stock and converted previously issued vested and unvested pixar equity-based awards into approximately 45 million disney equity-based awards. as anticipated, the earnings contributed by pixar operations in fiscal 2007 per share issued in the transaction were less than the earnings per share of the remainder of our businesses, effectively reducing earnings per share in fiscal 2007 compared to what earnings per share would have been in the absence of the transaction. the company believes, however, that the transaction yields benefits beyond the earnings contributed by the operations of pixar and that the transaction will ultimately be accretive to earnings per share. there can be no assurance that the increase in earnings per share expected in the longer term will be achieved. in order to achieve increases in earnings per share as a result of the acquisition, the company will, among other things, need to effectively continue the successful operations of pixar, develop successful sequels to prior pixar productions and improve the overall performance of the disney feature animation business. provisions in our corporate documents and delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to shareholders. our restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. the regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. the issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. in addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. 22 table of contents the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met, and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of animated theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company maintains fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency revenues. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen, and canadian 51 table of contents dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. it is the company policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at fiscal 2007 year end. the model includes all of the company debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis increased to $33 million at september 29, 2007 from $21 million at september 30, 2006. the increase was primarily due to higher volatility and a higher market value of currency-sensitive instruments. the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): fiscal year 2007 interest rate sensitive financial instruments currency sensitive financial instruments equity sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio year end var $ 26 $ 17 $ 1 $ 33 average var $ 17 $ 14 $ 1 $ 23 highest var $ 26 $ 17 $ 1 $ 33 lowest var $ 12 $ 12 $ 1 $ 18 beginning of year var (year end fiscal 2006) $ 22 $ 10 $ 1 $ 21 the var for euro disney and hong kong disneyland is immaterial as of september 29, 2007. in calculating the var it was determined that credit risks are the primary driver for changes in the value of euro disney debt rather than interest rate risks. accordingly, we have excluded euro disney borrowings from the above var calculation.risk factors 18 risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: recent changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have a continuing adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. recent turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business. there is evidence that this is affecting demand for some of our products and services, and a continued decline in economic activity could adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. a sustained decline in economic conditions could reduce attendance and spending at one or more of our parks and resorts, purchase of or prices for advertising on our broadcast or cable networks or owned stations, prices that cable service providers will pay for our cable programming, performance of our theatrical and home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products. these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-united states markets, or reduce the united states dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. each of our businesses creates entertainment or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. many of our businesses increasingly depend on worldwide acceptance of our offerings and products outside the united states, and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the united states. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film 18 table of contents receipts or home video or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline and adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media and entertainment businesses in which we participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. in addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired markets. for example: the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats, including dvd players and personal video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies, including web-based delivery of entertainment offerings; technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options and if consumers favor options we have not yet fully developed rather than the entertainment products we offer, our sales may be adversely affected. the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. the success of our businesses is highly dependent on maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, and increased broadband internet speed and penetration have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. there is evidence that unauthorized use of intellectual property rights in the entertainment industry generally is a significant and rapidly growing phenomenon. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unauthorized use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unauthorized digital distribution of our content and sales of unauthorized dvds and other counterfeit products. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the united states, globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees they could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some but not all of these events, and when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions and caps. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. 19 table of contents changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we may also need to invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. recent turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. u.s. and global credit and equity markets have recently undergone significant disruption, making it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. in addition, equity markets are continuing to experience rapid and wide fluctuations in value. if these conditions continue or worsen, our cost of borrowing may increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on the company performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. the disruption in the global financial markets has also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts. increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, as well as newspaper, magazines, billboards and the internet. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, interactive and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. 20 table of contents sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with more than 150,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. as a result of recent overall market conditions, we have experienced a significant decline in the fair value of our pension and post retirement medical plan assets since our june 30, 2008 measurement date. these macro-economic factors as well as the decline in the fair value of pension plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future funding contributions. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to cable service providers. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of united states and overseas regulations. these regulations include: united states fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. environmental protection regulations. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulatory areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who 21 table of contents manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. the contract the company and other producers had with the screen actors guild expired june 30, 2008 without agreement on terms for a new contract. there can be no assurance that a new agreement will be reached without a work stoppage, and any work stoppage could limit production and distribution of films or result in limitations on production and airing of television programming, either of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profitability. provisions in our corporate documents and delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to shareholders. our restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. the regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. the issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. in addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met, and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of animated theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, commodities, and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency revenues. the company 50 table of contents utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen, and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. it is the company policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at fiscal year end. the model includes all of the company debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis increased to $79 million at september 27, 2008 from $33 million at september 29, 2007. the increase was primarily due to higher volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates and reduced correlation benefits across financial instruments. the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): fiscal year 2008 interest rate sensitive financial instruments currency sensitive financial instruments equity sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio year end var $ 53 $ 49 $ 1 $ 79 average var $ 40 $ 29 $ 1 $ 51 highest var $ 53 $ 49 $ 1 $ 79 lowest var $ 34 $ 11 $ 1 $ 33 beginning of year var (year end fiscal 2007) $ 26 $ 17 $ 1 $ 33 the var for euro disney and hong kong disneyland is immaterial as of september 27, 2008 and accordingly, has been excluded from the above table.risk factors 18 risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: recent changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have a continuing adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. the recent decline in economic activity in the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business has affected demand for some of our products and services, and continuation of this condition could adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. the decline in economic conditions has reduced and could continue to reduce spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of or prices for advertising on our broadcast or cable networks or owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products. a continuing decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts or prices that mvsps pay for our cable programming. economic conditions have also and could continue to impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-united states markets, or reduce the united states dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. each of our businesses creates entertainment or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. many of our businesses increasingly depend on worldwide acceptance of our offerings and products outside the united states, and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the united states. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home video or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline and adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. in addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired markets. for example: the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats, including dvd players and personal video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies, including web-based delivery of entertainment offerings; 18 table of contents technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options and if consumers favor options we have not yet fully developed rather than the entertainment products we offer, our sales may be adversely affected. the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the united states and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, and increased broadband internet speed and penetration have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. there is evidence that unauthorized use of intellectual property rights in the entertainment industry generally is a significant and rapidly growing phenomenon. inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the company operations worldwide, despite the company efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed digital distribution of our content and sales of unauthorized dvds, blu-ray discs and other products. with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others, the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our rights in intellectual property by third parties. successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. the company is not aware of any challenges to its intellectual property rights that it currently foresees having a material effect on its operations. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the united states, globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees they could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some but not all of these events, and when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions and caps. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in 19 table of contents addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we may also need to invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. u.s. and global credit and equity markets experienced significant disruption beginning in late 2008, making it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. in addition, equity markets experienced rapid and wide fluctuations in value. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on the company performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. the disruption in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts. increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and the internet, as well as with newspapers, magazines and billboards. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. our interactive media video game operations compete primarily with other publishers of video game software and other types of home entertainment. competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. 20 table of contents sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with approximately 144,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macro-economic factors as well as the decline in the fair value of pension plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future funding contributions. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to mvsps. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of united states and overseas regulations. these regulations include: united states fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. environmental protection regulations. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulatory areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. 21 table of contents provisions in our corporate documents and delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to shareholders. our restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. the regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. the issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. in addition, provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation require supermajority shareholder approval of some acquisition transactions and we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law, either of which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met, and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. revenues in our interactive media segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors, including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends. accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. the company acquisition of marvel is expected to cause short term dilution in earnings per share and there can be no assurance that anticipated improvements in earnings per share will be realized. on august 31, 2009, the company entered into an agreement to acquire marvel entertainment, inc. in a merger transaction. based on the number of fully diluted shares of marvel common stock outstanding as of september 18, 2009, the company expects (assuming there is no adjustment to the exchange ratio) that the number of issued and outstanding shares will increase by approximately 58.5 million shares as a result of the merger. we expect that the merger will initially result in lower earnings per share than we would have earned in the absence of the merger. we expect that over time the merger will yield benefits to the combined company such that the merger will ultimately be accretive to earnings per share. however, there can be no assurance that the increase in earnings per share expected in the long term will be achieved. in order to achieve increases in earnings per share as a result of the merger, the combined company will, among other things, need to effectively continue the successful operations of marvel after the 22 table of contents merger, develop successful new content (including future feature films and television series or sequels to marvel productions) based on marvel characters and successfully integrate marvel products into the combined company various distribution channels. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, commodities, and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen, and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. it is the company policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at fiscal year end. the model includes all of the company debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis decreased to $34 million at october 3, 2009 from $68 million at september 27, 2008. the decrease was primarily due to increased diversification benefits across financial instruments and lower volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates. 52 table of contents the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): fiscal year 2009 interest rate sensitive financial instruments currency sensitive financial instruments equity sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio year end var $ 24 $ 19 $ 0 $ 34 average var $ 52 $ 23 $ 1 $ 66 highest var $ 86 $ 33 $ 1 $ 100 lowest var $ 24 $ 19 $ 0 $ 34 beginning of year var (year end fiscal 2008) $ 53 $ 24 $ 1 $ 68 the var for euro disney and hong kong disneyland is immaterial as of october 3, 2009 and accordingly, has been excluded from the above table.risk factors 17 risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. a decline in economic activity in the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. the most recent decline in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. a decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts or prices that mvsps pay for our cable programming. economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-united states markets, or reduce the united states dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. our businesses create entertainment, travel or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the united states, and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the united states. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our 17 table of contents entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home video or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline and adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. in addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired markets. for example, the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats, including dvd players and personal video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies, including web-based delivery of entertainment offerings. in addition, technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options which may include options we have not yet fully developed, or options we have developed but on which we realize a smaller return than on traditional options and thus the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience. the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the united states and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, and increased broadband internet speed and penetration have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. there is evidence that unauthorized use of intellectual property rights in the entertainment industry generally is a significant and rapidly growing phenomenon. inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the company operations worldwide, despite the company efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed digital distribution of our content and sales of unauthorized dvds, blu-ray discs and other products. with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others, the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our rights in intellectual property by third parties. successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. the company is not aware of any challenges to its intellectual property rights that it currently foresees having a material effect on its operations. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the united states, globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes and earthquakes) arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term climate change; health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third 18 table of contents parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, that could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and liability for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions and caps. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we may also need to invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. u.s. and global credit and equity markets experienced significant disruption beginning in late 2008, making it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. in addition, equity markets experienced rapid and wide fluctuations in value. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on the company performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. the disruption in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts. increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and the internet, as well as with newspapers, magazines and billboards. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. 19 table of contents our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. our interactive game operations compete with other publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with approximately 149,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macro-economic factors as well as the decline in the fair value of pension plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future funding contributions. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to mvsps. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of united states and overseas regulations. these regulations include: united states fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. environmental protection regulations. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulatory areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. 20 table of contents our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. our operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than united states law. laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the united states, and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights differently than would be expected under united states law. moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. as a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-united states jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if united states law governed these operations. labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. provisions in our corporate documents and delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to shareholders. our restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. the regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. the issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. in addition, provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation require supermajority shareholder approval of some acquisition transactions and we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law, either of which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met, and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. revenues in our interactive media segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors, including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends. accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. 21 table of contents the company acquisition of marvel is expected to cause short term dilution in earnings per share and there can be no assurance that anticipated improvements in earnings per share will be realized. on december 31, 2009, the company acquired marvel entertainment, inc. in a merger transaction in which the company distributed approximately 59 million shares and paid approximately $2.4 billion in cash. we expect that the merger will initially result in lower earnings per share than we would have earned in the absence of the merger. we expect that over time the merger will yield benefits to the combined company such that the merger will ultimately be accretive to earnings per share. however, there can be no assurance that the increase in earnings per share expected in the long term will be achieved. in order to achieve increases in earnings per share as a result of the merger, the combined company will, among other things, need to effectively continue the successful operations of marvel after the merger, develop successful new content (including future feature films and television series or sequels to marvel productions) based on marvel characters and successfully integrate marvel products into the combined company various distribution channels. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed

factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our

digital form. data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. if our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the united states, globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. for example, the earthquake and tsunami in japan in march 2011 resulted in a period of suspension of our operations and those of certain of our licensees in japan, including tokyo disney resort and resulted in a loss of revenue from those operations. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, that could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and liability for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits of liability. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. in recent years, such investments have included investments in new cruise ships, expansion and repurposing of certain of our theme park attractions, and development of a resort facility in hawaii. in addition, a joint venture in which we participate recently began construction of a theme park in shanghai, china. some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. 18 table of contents turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. past disruptions in the u.s. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. in addition, equity markets have recently experienced rapid and wide fluctuations in value. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on the company performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts. increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and the internet, as well as with newspapers, magazines and billboards. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. our interactive game operations compete with other publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. 19 table of contents sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with approximately 156,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macro-economic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and post retirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and post retirement medical benefits and may increase future funding contributions. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to mvsps. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of united states and overseas regulations. these regulations include: united states fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. environmental protection regulations. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulatory areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. our operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than united states law. laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the united states, and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under united states law. moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. as a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-united states jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if united states law governed these operations. 20 table of contents labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. provisions in our corporate documents and delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to shareholders. our restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. the regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. the issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. in addition, provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation require supermajority shareholder approval of some acquisition transactions and we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law, either of which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met, and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. revenues in our interactive media segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors, including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends. accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, commodities, and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen, and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. it is the company policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. 50 table of contents value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at fiscal year end. the model includes all of the company debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis increased to $58 million at october 1, 2011 from $33 million at october 2, 2010. the increase in var primarily reflected an increase in the amount of fixed rate debt during the year and higher volatility of interest rates. the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): fiscal year 2011 interest rate sensitive financial instruments currency sensitive financial instruments equity sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio year end var $34 $27 $7 $58 average var $24 $27 $4 $44 highest var $34 $34 $8 $58 lowest var $15 $20 $1 $32 beginning of year var (year end fiscal 2010) $19 $22 $1 $33 the var for disneyland paris and hong kong disneyland resort is immaterial as of october 1, 2011 and accordingly, has been excluded from the above table.risk factors 17 risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. a decline in economic activity in the u.s. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. the most recent decline in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. a decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts or prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming. recent instability in european economies presents risks of similar impacts in our european operations. economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-u.s. markets, or reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets, and economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. our businesses create entertainment, travel or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the u.s., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the u.s. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home video or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. 17 table of contents changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products or the cost of producing or distributing products. the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. in addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner and markets in which our products are distributed to consumers, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired markets. for example, the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats, including dvd players and digital video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies, including web-based delivery of entertainment offerings. in addition, technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options and delivery vehicles which may include options we have not yet fully developed, or options we have developed but which entail a smaller return than we realize on traditional options. as a result, the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products. the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, and increased broadband internet speed and penetration have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. the unauthorized use of intellectual property in the entertainment industry generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the company operations worldwide, despite the company efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed digital distribution of our content and sales of unauthorized dvds, blu-ray discs and other products. with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others, the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. the company is not aware of any challenges to its intellectual property rights that it currently foresees having a material effect on its operations. protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation. we maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. if our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. if personal information of our customers or employees is 18 table of contents misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident. a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services. demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the u.s., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. for example, the earthquake and tsunami in japan in march 2011 resulted in a period of suspension of our operations and those of certain of our licensees in japan, including tokyo disney resort and resulted in a loss of revenue from those operations. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, that could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and liability for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss. changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses. as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. in recent years, such investments have included investments in new cruise ships, expansion and repurposing of certain of our theme park attractions, and development of a resort facility in hawaii. in addition, a joint venture in which we participate recently began construction of a theme park in shanghai, china. some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments. past disruptions in the u.s. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in significant part, on the company performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts. 19 table of contents increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs. we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example: our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage. our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and the internet, as well as with newspapers, magazines and billboards. our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers. our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks. our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities. our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment. our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share. our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. our interactive game operations compete with other publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment. competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services. sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. with approximately 166,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macro-economic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and post retirement medical benefits and may increase future funding contributions. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses. our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to mvpds. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term 20 table of contents contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses. our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of u.s. and overseas regulations. these regulations include: u.s. fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 business media networks, federal regulation. environmental protection regulations. federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations. regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations. imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas. domestic and international tax laws or currency controls. changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable. our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions. our operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than u.s. law. laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the u.s., and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under u.s. law. moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. as a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-u.s. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if u.s. law governed these operations. labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses. a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. provisions in our corporate documents and delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to shareholders. our restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. the regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. the issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. in addition, provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation require supermajority shareholder approval of some acquisition transactions and we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law, either of which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. 21 table of contents the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows: revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming commitments are met. these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the company fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period. revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts. revenues in our interactive segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors, including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends. accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year. the company pending acquisition of lucasfilm is expected to cause short term dilution in earnings per share and there can be no assurance that anticipated improvements in earnings per share will be realized. on october 30, 2012, the company entered into an agreement to acquire lucasfilm ltd. in a merger transaction in which the company is expected to distribute approximately 40 million shares and pay approximately $2.025 billion in cash. we expect that the merger will initially result in lower earnings per share than we would have earned in the absence of the merger. we expect that over time the merger will yield benefits to the combined company such that the merger will ultimately be accretive to earnings per share. however, there can be no assurance that the increase in earnings per share expected in the long term will be achieved. in order to achieve increases in earnings per share as a result of the merger, the combined company will, among other things, need to effectively continue the successful operations of lucasfilm after the merger, develop successful new content (including future feature films) based on lucasfilm intellectual property and successfully integrate lucasfilm products into the combined company various distribution channels. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 53 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. policies and procedures in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, commodities, and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments. our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen, and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. the economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. it is the company policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. value at risk (var) the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, and market sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at fiscal year end. the model includes all of the company debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. var on a combined basis increased to $79 million at september 29, 2012 from $58 million at october 1, 2011. the increase in var primarily reflected an increase in foreign exchange exposures and greater sensitivity to interest rates in our fixed rate debt portfolio. 53 table of contents the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): fiscal year 2012 interest rate sensitive financial instruments currency

the above table.
