- qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks" 19 our business overview we develop, market, sell and distribute, in the main, a wide range of branded beverages. the majority of our beverages fall within the growing "alternative" beverage category. the principal brand names under which our beverages are marketed are hansen's(r), monster energy(tm), blue sky(r), junior juice(r), and lost(r). we own all of our above-listed brand names other than lost(r) which we produce, market, sell and distribute under an exclusive licensing arrangement with lost international llc. our company principally generates revenues, income and cash flows by developing, producing, marketing, selling and distributing finished beverage products. we generally sell these products to retailers as well as distributors. we incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brands including advertising costs, sponsorship fees and special promotional events. we focus on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events. retailers and distributors receive rebates, promotions, point of sale materials, merchandise displays and coolers. we also use in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, and sponsorship of, and endorsements from, selected public and extreme sports figures and causes. consumers receive coupons, discounts and promotional incentives. these marketing expenditures help to enhance distribution and availability of our products as well as awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands. greater distribution and availability, awareness and preference promotes long term growth. during 2003, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. in particular, we continue to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the "alternative" beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. we believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation; such as making hansen's(r) products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. we review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. the labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. we again achieved record sales in 2003. the increase in gross and net sales in 2003 was primarily attributable to sales of our monster energy(r) drink, which was introduced in april 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") monster energy(r) drink which was introduced in 2003, as well as increased sales of natural sodas, in particular diet natural sodas, our energy deuce drink, junior juice, diet energy, apple juice and, to a lesser extent, sparkling beverages. the increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales primarily of energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, smoothies, e2o energy water(r), soy smoothies, energade(r) energy sports drinks, and teas, lemonades and cocktails. during 2003, sales outside of california represented 47% of our aggregate sales, as compared to approximately 42% of our aggregate sales in 2002. sales to distributors outside the united states during 2003 amounted to $1,612,000 compared to $1,242,000 in 2002. our customers are typically retail and specialty chains, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors and health food distributors. in 2003, sales to retailers represented 47% of our revenues, sales to full service distributors represented 37% of our revenues and sales to health food distributors represented 10% of our revenues. 20 in 2003, we introduced a carbonated lo-carb monster energy(r) drink in 16-ounce cans, a carbonated energy deuce drink in 16-ounce cans, a diet root beer natural soda, a 100% apple juice in aseptic pouches, and regular and diet sparkling lemonades and orangeades in 12-ounce glass bottles. sales of our dual-branded 100% juice line named "juice blast(r)", which was launched in conjunction with costco and is sold nationally through costco stores, were lower in 2003 than in 2002. we have, in conjunction with costco, introduced new flavors in place of certain of the existing flavors and will continue to introduce new flavors in an effort to ensure that the variety pack remains fresh and different for consumers. in september 2000, hbc, through its wholly owned subsidiary blue sky, acquired the blue sky(r) natural soda business. the blue sky(r) natural soda brand is the leading natural soda in the health food trade. blue sky offers natural sodas, premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as ginseng and anti-oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12-ounce cans and a blue energy drink in 8.3-ounce cans. during the year, we continued to expand distribution of the blue sky products into mainstream grocery chain stores throughout the country. in may 2001, hbc, through its wholly owned subsidiary junior juice, acquired the junior juice(r) beverage business. the junior juice(r) product line is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23-ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. during 2003, we entered into several new distribution agreements for the sale of our products, both within and outside the united states. as discussed under "item 1 business - manufacture and distribution", we anticipate that we will continue building our national sales force in 2004 to support and grow the sales of our products. a chain grocery store strike in southern california, which commenced during the last quarter of 2003, adversely affected sales of those of our products that are carried by the stores concerned. however, the drop in sales of such products was partially offset by increased sales of certain of those products that are carried by other retailers in southern california. in 2002, we introduced a sparkling cider 100% juice drink in a 1.5 liter magnum glass bottle. however, due to limited reports of some bottles breaking, we promptly recalled the product. we are pursuing a claim for the costs and losses incurred by us. we will reevaluate relaunching this product once certain production issues are resolved to our satisfaction. at the beginning of 2004, we launched a new carbonated energy drink under the lost(r) brand name, in a 16-ounce can. the lost(r) brand name is owned by lost international llc and the drinks are produced, sold and distributed by us under exclusive license from lost international llc. during 2004, we were awarded an exclusive contract by the state of california, department of health services women, infant and children supplemental nutrition branch, to supply 100% apple juice and 100% apple grape juice in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles. see "item 1 business - manufacture and distribution." we continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. value drivers of our business we believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: o profitable growth - we believe healthy brands - properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base-drive profitable growth. we continue to broaden our family of brands. in particular, we are expanding and growing our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. we are focused on maintaining or increasing profit margins. we believe that tailored brand, package, price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. we are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. 21 o cost management - the principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction. one key area of focus, for example, is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. another key area of focus is the reduction in inventory levels. however, due to the expansion in the number of our products as well as increased sales levels in 2003, overall inventory levels increased. o efficient capital structure - our capital structure is intended to optimize our costs of capital. we believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds at low effective cost and overall low costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. we believe that these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in (1) maintaining and improving our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. the ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. gross and net operating revenues, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. in 2003, gross operating revenues totaled $138.5 million, a 19.9% increase from 2002. net operating revenues totaled $110.4 million, an increase of 19.9% over 2002. gross profit totaled $43.8 million in 2003, a 31.7% increase from 2002. operating income was $9.8 million compared to $5.3 million for 2002. net income was $5.9 million as compared to $3.0 million for 2002. net income per share (diluted) was $0.55 from $0.29 per diluted share in 2002. these measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2004 and beyond. see also "results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2003 compared to the year ended december 31, 2002. in 2003, the company had working capital of $17.2 million compared to $15 million as of december 31, 2002. in 2003, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $5.5 million, a 101% increase from 2002. principal uses of cash flows are purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and trademark licenses and trademarks. repayment of our debt and accounts payable are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. see also liquidity and capital resources. opportunities, challenges and risks looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our company. increase in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. we recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. we continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences. 22 in addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our company's future financial results include, but are not limited to: o maintenance of our brand images and product quality; o profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (see also "item 1 business - competition" and "sales and marketing"); o restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; o protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademark licenses and trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; and o the imposition of additional restrictions. we believe that the following opportunities exist for us: o growth potential for non-alcoholic beverage categories including - energy drinks, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water; o new product introductions intended to contribute to higher gross profits; o premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; o significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; and o proper positioning to capture industry growth. 23 results of operations percentage change ------------------------- 2003 2002 2001 03 vs. 02 02 vs. 01 --------------- --------------- -------------- ------------ ------------ gross sales $

higher than net sales of $92.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2002. the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales of our monster energy(tm) drink, which was introduced in april 2002, as well as increased sales of natural sodas, junior juice and, to a lesser extent, sparkling beverages. the increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales of functional drinks, smoothies, e2o energy water, energade(r) energy sports drinks, and children's multi-vitamin juice drinks as well as an increase in discounts, allowances and promotional payments. gross profit. gross profit was $43.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2003, an increase of $10.5 million or 31.7% over the $33.2 million gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2002. gross profit as a

development activities including cooperative arrangements with our distributors, sponsorships and promotions, in-store demonstrations and merchandise displays which was partially offset by decreased expenditures for graphic design. in addition, we incurred expenses of approximately $267,000 during 2003 in connection with our sponsorship of the las vegas monorail as part of our efforts to promote

for the acquisition of property, trademark license and trademarks. net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2003 was $5,484,000, compared to cash provided by operating

taxes payable, accrued compensation, and accrued liabilities which was partially offset by increases in inventories. purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademark licenses and trademarks, and repayment of our line of credit and accounts payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2003 was $2,438,000 as compared to net cash used in investment activities of $92,000 in 2002. the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to increased purchases of property and equipment and an increase in trademarks as well as a decrease in expenditures for deposits and other assets in 2003 which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, particularly, specific items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, merchandise display racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment and businesses compatible with the image of the hansen's(r) brand, as well as the introduction of new product lines. net cash used in financing activities was $2,486,000 for the year ending december 31, 2003, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $2,344,000 in 2002. the increase in net cash used in financing activities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to increased principal payments of long-term debt, which was partially offset by increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2003. hbc has a credit facility from comerica bank-california ("comerica"), consisting of a revolving line of credit and a term loan. the utilization of the revolving line of credit by hbc was dependent upon certain levels of eligible accounts receivable and inventory from time to time. such revolving line of credit and term loan are secured by substantially all of hbc's assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks, trademark licenses and certain equipment. in accordance with the provisions of the credit facility, hbc can borrow up to $12.0 million under its line of credit, reducing to $6.0 million by september 2004. the revolving line of credit remains in full force and effect through september 2005. interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on bank's base (prime) rate, plus an additional percentage of up to 0.5% or the libor rate, plus an additional percentage of up to 2.5%, depending upon certain financial ratios of hbc from time to time. at december 31, 2003, hbc had no balances outstanding under the credit facility and borrowing capacity available to the company from comerica under the credit facility was $7,800,000. the terms of the company's line of credit contain certain financial covenants including certain financial ratios and annual net income requirements. the line of credit contains provisions under which applicable interest rates will be adjusted in increments based on the achievement of certain financial ratios. the company was in compliance with its financial ratios and annual net income requirements and obtained a waiver from comerica with regards to its capital expenditure limitations at december 31, 2003. 28 if any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to secured parties under the uniform commercial code, institute legal proceedings to foreclose upon the lien and security interest granted or for the sale of any or all collateral. purchase obligations represent commitments made by the company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. these obligations vary in terms. other commitments represent our obligations under our agreement with the las vegas monorail company. see also "item 1 - sales and

================== ================= ================== management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment through december 31, 2004. accounting policies and pronouncements critical accounting policies the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap".) gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks and trademark licenses as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business.the following summarize the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the company: trademark license and trademarks - trademark license and trademarks primarily represent the company's exclusive ownership of the hansen's(r) trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages and water and non-beverage products. the company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the united states as well as in a number of countries around the world. the company also owns the blue sky(r) trademark, which was acquired in september 2000, and the junior juice(r) trademark, which was acquired in may 2001. during 2002, the company adopted sfas no. 142, "goodwill and other intangible assets." under the provisions on sfas no. 142, the company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademark licenses and trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademark licenses and trademarks over one to 25 years. 29 in accordance with sfas no. 142, we evaluate our trademark license and trademarks annually for impairment. we measure impairment by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the trademark license and trademarks. the fair value is calculated using the income approach. based on our annual impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of 2003, the estimated fair values of trademark license and trademarks exceeded the carrying value. long-lived assets - management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. this review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. if there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. the fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management's estimates of the business risks. annually, or earlier, if there is indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. an impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. no impairments were identified as of december 31, 2003. management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademark license and trademarks, is a "critical accounting estimate" because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. management's assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. in estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. internal budgets are developed based on recent revenues data for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. advertising and promotional allowances - the company accounts for advertising production costs by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. in addition, the company supports its customers with promotional allowances, a portion of which is utilized for marketing and indirect advertising by them. in certain instances, a portion of the promotional allowances payable to customers based on the levels of sales to such customers, promotion requirements or expected use of the allowances, are estimated by the company. if the level of sales, promotion requirements or use of the allowances are different from such estimates, the promotional allowances could, to the extent based on estimates, require adjustments. during 2002, the company adopted emerging issues task force ("eitf") no. 01-9 which requires certain sales promotions and customer allowances previously classified as selling, general and administrative expenses to be classified as a reduction of sales or as cost of goods sold. the company has conformed its presentation of advertising and promotional allowances to comply with the provisions of eitf no. 01-9. accounts receivable - the company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. in circumstances where the company becomes aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to the company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the company believes will ultimately be collected. in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the company's recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. 30 inventories - inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. the company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the company's estimated forecast of product demand and/or its ability to sell the products concerned and production requirements. demand for the company's products can fluctuate significantly. factors which could affect demand for the company's products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. additionally, management's estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. income taxes - current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. the company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. if the company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the company's judgment. if the company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. see note 7 in notes to consolidated financial statements. newly issued accounting pronouncements in november 2002, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued fasb interpretation no. ("fin") 45, "guarantor's accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others," an interpretation sfas nos. 5, 57 and 107, and rescission of fin 34, "disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others." fin 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. it also requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31, 2002, while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december 15, 2002. the company adopted such interpretation on november 1, 2002 with no material impact to the consolidated financial statements. in january 2003, the fasb issued fin 46(r), "consolidation of variable interest entities," an interpretation of arb no. 51, and revised in december 2003. fin 46(r) requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. fin 46(r) is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after december 31, 2003. for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to december 31, 2003, the provisions of fin 46(r) must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after march 15, 2004. the company does not expect that the adoption of fin 46(r) will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as the company has no interests in variable interest entities. 31 in may 2003, the fasb issued sfas no. 150, "accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity," as amended by various fasb staff positions posted in october and november 2003, which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. sfas no. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope which may have previously been reported as equity, as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31, 2003 and otherwise is generally effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15, 2003, except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities, which are subject to the provision of this statement for the first fiscal period beginning after december 15, 2004. the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas no. 150 will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. sales the table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. a "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage. unit case volume of the company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company. sales of food bars and cereals are expressed in actual cases. a case of food bars and cereals is defined as follows: o a fruit and grain bar and functional nutrition bar case equals ninety 1.76-ounce bars. o a natural cereal case equals ten 13-ounce boxes measured by volume. o an active nutrition bar case equals thirty-two 1.4-ounce bars. the company's quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. it has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. because the primary historical market for hansen's products is california, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of hansen's products expands outside of california. the company has not had sufficient experience with many its newer product introductions and consequently has no knowledge of the trends which may occur with such products. quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products, soda concentrates and increased advertising and promotional expenses. see also "item 1.

for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements, including statements contained in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to shareholders and announcements. certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of section 27.a of the securities act 1933, as amended, and section 21.e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things. all statements which address operating performance, events or developments that management expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future including statements related to new products, volume growth, revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations, and/or the company's existing credit facility, earnings per share growth, statements expressing general optimism about future operating results and non-historical information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the act. these statements are qualified by their terms and/or important factors, many of which are outside our control, involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made including, but not limited to, the following: o company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans and general operating activities; o decreased demand for our products resulting from changes in consumer preferences; o changes in demand that are weather related, particularly in areas outside of california; o competitive products and pricing pressures and the company's ability to gain or maintain its share of sales in the marketplace as a result of actions by competitors; 33 o the introduction of new products; o an inability to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives; o laws and regulations, and/or any changes therein, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations) and environmental laws as well as the federal food drug and cosmetic act, the dietary supplement health and education act, and regulations made thereunder or in connection therewith, as well as changes in any other food and drug laws, especially those that may affect the way in which the company's products are marketed and/or labeled and/or sold, including the contents thereof, as well as laws and regulations or rules made or enforced by the food and drug administration and/or the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms, and/or federal trade commission, and/or certain state regulatory agencies; o changes in the cost and availability of raw materials and the ability to maintain favorable supply arrangements and relationships and procure timely and/or adequate production of all or any of the company's products; o the company's ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others. there can be no assurance that the company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales; o the company's ability to penetrate new markets; o the marketing efforts of distributors of the company's products, most of which distribute products that are competitive with the products of the company; o unilateral decisions by distributors, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of the company's products that they are carrying at any time; o the terms and/or availability of the company's credit facility and the actions of its creditors; o the effectiveness of the company's advertising, marketing and promotional programs; o changes in product category consumption; o unforeseen economic and political changes; o possible recalls of the company's products; and o the company's ability to make suitable arrangements for the co-packing of any of its products including, but not limited to, its energy and functional drinks in 8.3-ounce slim cans and 16-ounce cans, smoothies in 11.5-ounce cans, e2o energy water(r), energade(r), monster energy(r) and lost(r) energy drinks, soy smoothies, sparkling orangeades and lemonades in glass bottles and other products. the foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. we expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. 34 item 7a. qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) which the company is exposed to are fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and changes in interest rates of the company's long term debt. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we are also subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of accounts receivable. at december 31, 2003, the majority of the company's debt consisted of fixed rather than variable rate debt. the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the company's cash requirements. if average interest rates were to increase one percent for the year ended december 31, 2003, the net impact on the company's pre-tax earnings would have been insignificant.qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) which the company is exposed to are fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and changes in interest rates of the company's long term debt and the limited availability of certain raw materials such as sucralose. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we are also subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of accounts receivable. at december 31, 2004, the majority of the company's debt consisted of fixed rather than variable rate debt. the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the company's cash requirements. if average interest rates were to increase one percent for the year ended december 31, 2003, the net impact on the company's pre-tax earnings would have been insignificant.risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as the coca-cola company, pepsico inc., cadbury schweppes plc, red bull gmbh, kraft foods inc., nestle beverage company, tree top and ocean spray. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the "energy drink" category could adversely affect our operating results. a substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our monster energy(r) brand energy drinks. our dsd segment which comprises primarily energy drinks, represented 77.4% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2005. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy(r) brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category. our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, adrenaline rush, amp, rockstar, no fear, full throttle, 180, kmx, venom, extreme energy shot, us energy, red devil, rip it, nos, boo koo, lipovitan, met-rx, hype, xtc, and many other brands. a number of companies who market and distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in different packages, such as 16 and 20-ounce glass bottles, including sobe, snapple elements, arizona, fuse, and vitamin water, have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products as "functional" or "energy" beverages or as having functional benefits. in addition, certain large companies such as the coca-cola company and pepsico inc. market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as mountain dew, mountain dew mdx, vault, adrenaline rush, amp, no fear, full throttle, and rockstar. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues or we could experience price erosion or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results. change in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. there is increasing awareness and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could affect our profitability. 18 consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. additionally, many of our products are considered premium products and to maintain market share during recessionary periods we may have to reduce profit margins which would adversely affect our results of operations. product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers' preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we also may be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. we do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. although our production arrangements are generally of short duration or are terminable upon request, in the event of a disruption or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited packing facilities in the united states with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including hansen's(r) brand energy drinks in 8.3-ounce and 16-ounce cans, gold standard line, aseptic juice products, juices in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles, energade(r), monster energy(r), lost(r), rumba(tm) and joker mad energy(tm) energy drinks in 8.3, 15.5, 16, and 24-ounce cans, sparkling lemonades and orangeades and other products. there are also limited shrink sleeve labeling facilities available to us in the united states with adequate capacity for our e2o energy water(r). a disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing facilities in the united states with adequate capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. consequently, a disruption in production of such products could adversely affect our revenues. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our dsd products. if we are unable to secure such bottlers and distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. we continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products including energy drinks. in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our dsd brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market and promote our products above the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 19 our customers are material to our success. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, and/or convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of the our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. one customer accounted for approximately 18% and 13% of the companys sales for the years ended december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. a decision by that, or any other large customer, to decrease the amount purchased from the company or to cease carrying the companys products could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and consolidated results of operations. we have exclusive contracts with the state of california ("state") department of health services, women, infant and children ("wic") supplemental nutrition branch ("dhs") to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice, in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles. the contracts are each for a period of three years with a further one-year extension option to be mutually agreed between hansens and the state of california. the current contracts expire on july 11, 2007, and we have no knowledge of whether the contracts will be extended for a further one year, or whether we will be successful in securing any new future wic contracts with the state. if we are unsuccessful in securing new future wic contracts with the state, our revenues from those products could be materially adversely affected. increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us comprise aluminum cans, glass bottles and pet plastic bottles as well as juices, high fructose corn syrup, sucrose and sucralose, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations. due to the consolidations that have taken place in the glass industry over the past few years, the prices of glass bottles continue to increase. the prices of pet plastic bottles and aluminum cans increased in 2005 and may increase in 2006. the prices of high fructose corn syrup, sucrose and certain juice concentrates have also increased during the year, particularly apple concentrate. these increased costs, together with increased costs primarily of energy and gas and freight resulted in increases in certain product costs which are ongoing and are expected to continue to exert pressure on our gross margins in 2006. in addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients will continue to rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. in addition, some of these raw materials, such as a sucralose and certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. sucralose, which is used in the company's low-calorie products, is purchased by us from a single manufacturer. the supplier of sucralose has notified us that our purchases of sucralose during 2006 will be subject to volume limitations due to demand for sucralose exceeding production capacity. while we believe that our 2006 sucralose volume allocation will be sufficient to meet the demand for our products that contain sucralose, we may need to reformulate certain of those products that contain sucralose with alternative sweetener systems to avoid an interruption in supply of those products, should the need arise. we may not correctly estimate demand for our products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, glass, pet plastic bottles, cans, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain sweeteners, or packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. we do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. 20 the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. the majority of our packaging supplies contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as resin for pet bottles and aluminum for cans. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. accordingly, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the cost of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. if we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. if we have to replace a flavor supplier, we could experience temporary disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in and to portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such property with registered and common law trademarks and copyrights, restrictions on disclosure and other actions to prevent infringement. product packages, mechanical designs and artwork are important to our success and we take action to protect against imitation of our packaging and trade dress and to protect our trademarks and copyrights as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. significant changes in government regulation may hinder sales. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products is subject to the federal food, drug and cosmetic act; the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. new statutes and regulations may also be instituted in the future. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or packaging changed, thus adversely affecting our financial condition and operations. california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. while none of our beverage products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the california list in the future. we also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. 21 if we are unable to maintain brand image or product quality, or if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to maintain and build brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. we have no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products' brand image and on consumer preferences. product quality issues, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if fake or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches. product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. while we have to date not experienced any credible product liability litigation, there is no assurance that we will not experience such litigation in the future. in the event we were to experience product liability claims or a product recall, our financial condition and business operations could be materially adversely effected. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management it may have an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance for any members of our senior management. we currently have employment agreements with mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg which end on december 31, 2008. the loss of services of either of these persons or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. weather could adversely affect our supply chain and demand for our products. with regard to fruit juice, fruit juice concentrates and natural flavors, the beverage industry is subject to variability of weather conditions, which may result in higher prices and/or the nonavailability of any of such items. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate, particularly in areas outside of california. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers) could affect our products' affordability and reduce our sales. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. 22 our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other persons and many other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we may be unable to achieve analysts earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others. there can be no assurance that the company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, at february 10, 2006, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to control a maximum of 21.2% of our outstanding common stock. consequently, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg could exercise significant control on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and approving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, which could adversely affect our financial results. - qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks"). our business overview we develop, market, sell and distribute, in the main, a wide range of branded beverages. the majority of our beverages fall within the growing "alternative" beverage category. the principal brand names under which our beverages are marketed are hansen's(r), monster energy(r), blue sky(r), junior juice(r), lost(r), rumba(tm) and joker mad energy(tm). we own all of our above-listed brand names other than lost(r) which we produce, market, sell and distribute under an exclusive licensing arrangement with lost international llc. our company principally generates revenues, income and cash flows by developing, producing, marketing, selling and distributing finished beverage products. we generally sell these products to retailers as well as distributors. we incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brands including advertising costs, athlete and event sponsorship fees and special promotional events. we focus on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events. retailers and distributors receive rebates, promotions, point of sale materials, merchandise displays and coolers. we also use in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, and sponsorship of, and endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, events and causes. consumers receive coupons, discounts and promotional incentives. these marketing expenditures help to enhance distribution and availability of our products as well as awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands. greater distribution and availability, awareness and preference promotes long term growth. during 2005, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. in particular, we continue to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the "alternative" beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. we believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation such as making hansen's(r) products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. we review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. the labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. a substantial portion of our sales are derived from "energy drinks", particularly our monster energy(r) brand energy drinks. any decrease in sales of our energy drinks, particularly our monster energy(r) brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. competitive pressure in the "energy drink" category could adversely affect our operating results. (see "part i item 1a. - risk factors") 28 we again achieved record sales in 2005. the increase in gross and net sales in 2005 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our monster energy(r) drinks, which were introduced in april 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") monster energy(r) drinks, which were introduced in 2003, our monster energy(r) assault(tm) energy drinks which were introduced in september 2004, sales of monster energy(r) khaos(tm) energy drinks, which were introduced in august 2005, increased sales by volume of lost(r) energy drinks which were introduced in january 2004, and to a lesser extent, to sales of joker mad energy(tm) drinks which were introduced in january 2005, as well as increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, children's multi-vitamin juice drinks and rumba(tm) energy juice, which was introduced in december 2004. the increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of hansen's(r) natural sodas, hansen's(r) energy drinks, energade(r), and smoothies in cans. during the year ended december 31, 2005, sales shipped outside of california represented 62% of our aggregate gross sales, as compared to 56% of our aggregate gross sales for the comparable period in 2004. during the year ended december 31, 2005, sales to distributors outside the united states amounted to $5.6 million, as compared to $2.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2004, which was less than 2% of gross sales for each period respectively. our customers are typically retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers. sales to our various customer types for 2005 are reflected below. the allocations below reflect changes made by the company to the categories historically reported. retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 19% club stores, drug & mass merchandisers 11% full service distributors 65% health food distributors 3% other 2% in 2004, we introduced a carbonated lost(r) energy drink in 16-ounce cans, a carbonated monster energy(r) assault(tm) drink in 16-ounce cans, a new line of blue sky(r) natural tea sodas in 12-ounce cans, hansen's(r) energy drinks in 16-ounce cans, rumba(tm) energy juice in 15.5-once cans and also introduced a new line of lo-carb smoothies in 11.5-ounce cans. in 2005, we introduced a carbonated joker mad energy(tm) drink in 16-ounce cans (regular and lo-carb) a carbonated monster energy(r) khaos(tm) energy drink in 16-ounce cans, monster energy(r) and lo-carb monster energy(r) in 24-ounce cans, monster energy(r), lo-carb monster energy(r) and monster energy(r) assault(tm) drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, a new line of blue sky(r) natural sodas with real sugar, a new line of lite blue sky(r) natural sodas in 12-ounce cans, a new line of non-carbonated blue sky(r) isotonic sports drinks in 16-ounce pet plastic bottles, as well as new juice products and fizzit(tm) which is a line of vitamin and mineral drink mixes in powdered form. sales of our dual-branded 100% juice line named juice blast(r), which was launched in conjunction with costco and is sold through costco stores, were $4.0 million in 2005 as compared to $2.0 million in 2004. we have and will continue to introduce new flavors from time to time in an effort to ensure that the variety pack remains fresh and different for consumers and retain and if possible increase current distribution levels. 29 in september 2000, hbc, through its wholly owned subsidiary blue sky, acquired the blue sky(r) natural soda business. the blue sky(r) natural soda brand is the leading natural soda in the health food trade. blue sky offers natural sodas, premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as ginseng and anti-oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12-ounce cans and a blue energy(r) drink in 8.3-ounce cans and in 2004 introduced a new line of blue sky(r) natural tea sodas in 12-ounce cans. in 2005, we introduced a new line of blue sky lite natural sodas, a new line of blue sky(r) natural sodas made with real sugar and a new line of non-carbonated blue sky(r) isotonic sports drinks. in may 2001, hbc, through its wholly owned subsidiary junior juice, acquired the junior juice(r) beverage business. the junior juice(r) product line is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23-ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. during 2005, we entered into several new distribution agreements for the sale of our products both within and outside the united states and substantially expanded our national sales force and marketing and support staff. as discussed under "part i item 1. - business manufacture and distribution", we anticipate that we will continue building our national sales force in 2006 as well as our marketing and support staff to support and grow the sales of our products. in 2002, we introduced a sparkling cider 100% juice drink in a 1.5-liter magnum glass bottle. however, due to limited reports of some bottles breaking in 2003, we promptly recalled the product. we are pursuing a claim for the costs and losses incurred by us. we will reevaluate relaunching this product once certain production issues are resolved to our satisfaction and a suitable co-packer has been identified. during 2004, we concluded exclusive contracts with the state of california, department of health services women, infant and children supplemental nutrition branch, to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles. the contracts commenced on july 12, 2004. (see "part i item 1. business manufacture and distribution"). we continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. value drivers of our business we believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: * profitable growth - we believe natural, better for you brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base-drive profitable growth. we continue to broaden our family of brands. in particular, we are expanding and growing our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. we are focused on maintaining or increasing profit margins. we believe that tailored brand, package, price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. we are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. * cost management - the principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction. one key area of focus, for example, is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. another key area of focus is the reduction in inventory levels. however, due to the expansion in the number of our products as well as increased sales levels in 2005, overall inventory levels increased. during 2005, the costs primarily of pet plastic bottles and aluminum cans, as well as the costs of high fructose corn syrup and sucrose and certain packaging and freight costs also increased. 30 * efficient capital structure - our capital structure is intended to optimize our costs of capital. we believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds at low effective cost and overall low costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. we believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in (1) maintaining and/or improving our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. the ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. gross and net operating revenues, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. in 2005, gross operating revenues totaled $415.4 million, an 85.4% increase over 2004. net operating revenues totaled $348.9 million, an increase of 93.5% over 2004. gross profit totaled $182.5 million in 2005, a 118.7% increase from 2004. operating income was $103.4 million compared to $33.9 million for 2004. net income was $62.8 million as compared to $20.4 million for 2004. net income per diluted share was $2.59 as compared to net income per diluted share of $.86 in 2004. these measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2006 and beyond. see also "results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2005 compared to the year ended december 31, 2004." in 2005, the company had working capital of $107.1 million compared to $41.6 million as of december 31, 2004. in 2005, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $54.6 million as compared to $20.1 million in 2004. principal uses of cash flows are purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and trademarks. payment of our debt and accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. (see also "part ii item 7. - liquidity and capital resources"). opportunities, challenges and risks looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our company. increase in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. we recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. we continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences. 31 in addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our companys future financial results include, but are not limited to: * maintenance of our brand images and product quality; * profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (see also "part i item 1. - business - competition and sales and marketing"); * restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; * protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; * limitations on available quantities of sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener that is used in many of our beverage products, during 2006, due to demand for such sweetener exceeding the supplier's production capacity, as well as limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap can and copacking availability; and * the imposition of additional restrictions. * (see also "part i item 1a. - risk factors") for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company. we believe that the following opportunities exist for us: * growth potential for non-alcoholic beverage categories including energy drinks, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water; * new product introductions intended to contribute to higher gross profits; * premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; * significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; and * proper positioning to capture industry growth. 32 results of operations percentage

indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with gaap, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by the company's internal reporting requirements. however, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall company performance. the use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of the companys operating performance. gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payment and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. 33 ** although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with gaap and meet gaap requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with gaap presentation requirements. additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. the presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of the marketing activities of the company. results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2005 compared to the year ended december 31, 2004 gross sales. for the year ended december 31, 2005, gross sales were $415.4 million, an increase of $191.3 million or 85.4% higher than gross sales of $224.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in gross sales is primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products and the introduction of new products as discussed below in "net sales". the percentage increase in gross sales was lower than the percentage increase in net sales due to a decrease in the promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, which decreased from 19.5% for the year ended december 31, 2004 to 16.0% for the year ended december 31, 2005, although the actual amount of promotional and other allowances increased from $43.8 million to $66.5 million for the respective periods. net sales. for the year ended december 31, 2005, net sales were $ 348.9 million, an increase of $168.5 million or 93.5% higher than net sales of $180.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. we again achieved record sales in 2005. the increase in gross and net sales in 2005 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our monster energy(r) drinks, which were introduced in april 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") monster energy(r) drinks, which were introduced in 2003, our monster energy(r) assault(tm) energy drinks which were introduced in september 2004, sales of monster energy(r) khaos(tm) energy drinks, which were introduced in august 2005, increased sales by volume of lost(r) energy drinks which were introduced in january 2004, and to a lesser extent, to sales of joker mad energy(tm) drinks which were introduced in january 2005, as well as increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, and children's multi-vitamin juice drinks and rumba(tm) which was introduced in december 2004. the increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of hansen's natural sodas(r), hansen's(r) energy drinks, energade(r) and smoothies in cans. net sales case volumes (calculated on 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage equivalent basis) increased from 29.8 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2004 to 48.2 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of 18.4 million cases or 62.0%. the overall average net sales price per case also increased to $7.24 per case for the year ended december 31, 2005 from $6.06 for the year ended december 31, 2004, an increase of 19.5%. the increase in the average net sales prices per case was due to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products as described below. net sales for the dsd segment were $270.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $157.0 million or 138.8% higher than net sales of $113.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in net sales for the dsd segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our monster energy(r) drinks, which were introduced in april 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") monster energy(r) drinks, which were introduced in 2003, our monster energy(r) assault(tm) energy drinks which were introduced in september 2004, sales of monster energy(r) khaos(tm) energy drinks, which were introduced in august 2005, increased sales by volume of lost energy drinks which were introduced in january 2004. the increase in net sales was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to sales of joker mad energy(tm) drinks which were introduced in january 2005. the increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of hansen's(r) energy drinks and energade(r). net sales for the warehouse segment were $78.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $11.3 million or 16.7% higher than net sales of $67.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase

juice, which was introduced in december 2004. the increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of smoothies in cans and hansen's(r) natural sodas. 34 gross profit. gross profit was $182.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of $99.1 million or 118.7% over the $83.5 million gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2004. gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.3% for the year ended december 31, 2005 which was higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 46.3% for the year ended december 31, 2004, due primarily to higher gross profit margins achieved on the increased sales of monster energy(r) and lost(r) energy drinks. although a greater percentage of our sales comprised products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit margins was partially reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products. gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales whereas others like hansen's exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as selling, general and administrative expenses. distribution expenses, which include out-bound freight and warehousing expenses after manufacture, were $22.1 million for the year ended december

65.2% higher than gross sales of $135.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2003. the increase in gross sales for the year ended december 31, 2004 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of certain of our existing products as well as the introduction of new products as discussed below in "net sales". the percentage increase in gross sales was comparable to the percentage increase in net sales. the promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased slightly from 18.7% for the year ended december 31, 2003 to 19.5% for the year ended december 31, 2004 as well as the actual amount of promotional and other allowances, which increased from $25.3 million to $43.8 million for the respective periods. 36 net sales. for the year ended december 31, 2004, net sales were $180.3 million, an increase of approximately $70.0 million or 63.4% higher than net sales of $110.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2003. the increase in gross and net sales in 2004 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of monster energy(r) drink, which was introduced in april 2002, including our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") monster energy(r) drink which was introduced in 2003 and sales by volume of lost energy drinks which were introduced at the beginning of 2004, as well as increased sales by volume of apple juice, juice blends, and energade(r) energy sports drinks. additionally, the increase in gross and net sales was attributable to the increased sales prices of and reduced allowances for smoothies in cans and natural sodas.

lemonades and cocktails. net sales case volumes increased from 20.4 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2003 to 29.8 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2004, an increase of 9.3 million cases or 45.7%. the overall average net sales price per case also increased to $6.06 per case for the year ended december 31, 2004 from $5.40 per case for the year ended december 31, 2003, an increase of 12.2%. the increase in the average net sales prices per case was due to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. net sales for the dsd segment were $113.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2004, an increase of approximately $63.6 million or 128.5% higher than net sales of $49.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2003. the increase in

a percentage of net sales of 39.7% for the year ended december 31, 2003. increases in gross sales volume contributed to an increase in gross profit while a change in the companys product and customer mix and the related increase in the percentage of sales of higher margin products increased both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales. this increase in profit margins was partially reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products. gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as selling, general and administrative expenses.

activities was $54.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2005 as compared to $20.1 million in the comparable period in 2004. for the year ended december 31, 2005, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned including adjustments for certain non-cash expenses. in 2005, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to increases in accounts receivable which was attributable to increased sales volumes as well as increased sales to certain classes of customers who have different payment terms, increases in inventories required to meet increased sales levels and the increases in prepaid income taxes. increases in inventory levels are the direct result of increases in purchasing, which contributed to the increased balances of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. cash flows from investing activities - net cash provided by investing activities was $3.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2005 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $18.8 million in the comparable period in 2004. for the year ended december 31, 2005, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments, and to a minor extent, the sale-leaseback of certain vans and promotional vehicles and the sale of certain property and equipment that was no longer operational. for both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of computer and office equipment used for sales and administrative activities, vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support the marketing and promotional activities of the company and also for additions to trademark. management expects that it will continue to use portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations, to purchase short-term investments and for other corporate purposes. management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, particularly, specific items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, merchandise display racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment and businesses compatible with the image of the companys brands, as well as the introduction of new product lines. cash flows from financing activities - net cash used in financing activities was $113,000 for the year ended december 31, 2005 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.3 million in the comparable period in 2004. for the year ended december 31, 2005, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the issuance of

============== ============= ============== ============== =============== in addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the company and rexam beverage can company ("rexam") dated as of january 1, 2006, the company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four year period commencing from january 1, 2006 through december 31, 2009. should the company fail to purchase the minimum volume, the company will be obligated to reimburse rexam for certain capital reimbursements on a pro rated basis. the company's maximum liability under this agreement is $4.3 million subject to compliance by rexam with a number of conditions under this agreement. 40 management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment for at least the next twelve months. based on the company's current plans, at this time the company estimates that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $5 million through december 2006. however, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. accounting policies and pronouncements critical accounting policies the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. the following summarize the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the company: trademarks - trademarks primarily represent the companys exclusive ownership of the hansen's(r) trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages and water and non-beverage products and the monster energy(r) trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. the company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the united states as well as in a number of countries around the world. the company also owns the blue sky(r) trademark, which was acquired in september 2000, and the junior juice(r) trademark, which was acquired in may 2001. during 2002, the company adopted sfas no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets. under the provisions on sfas no. 142, the company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 20 years. in accordance with sfas no. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. if there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. an impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. the fair value is calculated using the income approach. however, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. based on managements quarterly impairment analysis performed, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying value. long-lived assets - management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. this review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. if there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. the fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management's estimates of the business risks. no impairments were identified during 2005, however, during 2004, management recognized an impairment to property and equipment as discussed in note 1 of the attached financial statements. 41 management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a "critical accounting estimate" because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. managements assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. in estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. revenue recognition - the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or reasonably determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. management believes an adequate provision against net sales has been made for estimated returns, allowances and cash discounts based on the company's historical experience. net sales - net sales consist of sales recorded at the time the related products are shipped and the risk of ownership and title have passed, less allowances for returns, spoilage, discounts and promotional allowances recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force ("eitf") issue no. 01-9. cost of sales - cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of our products, co-packing fees, in-bound freight charges as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the company's finished products and certain quality control costs. raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. operating expenses - operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport our products to our customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, expenses including advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, material costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. operating expenses also include general and administrative costs such as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. distribution expenses, which include out-bound freight and warehousing expenses after manufacture, were $22.1 million, $12.4 million and $8.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. advertising and promotional allowances - the company accounts for advertising production costs by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. in addition, the company supports its customers with promotional allowances, a portion of which is utilized for marketing and indirect advertising by them. in certain instances, a portion of the promotional allowances payable to customers based on the levels of sales to such customers, promotion requirements or expected use of the allowances, are estimated by the company. if the level of sales, promotion requirements or use of the allowances are different from such estimates, the promotional allowances could, to the extent based on estimates, require adjustments. the company presents advertising and promotional allowances in accordance with the provisions of eitf no. 01-9. 42 accounts receivable - the company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. in circumstances where the company becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to the company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the company believes will ultimately be collected. in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the companys recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. inventories - inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. the company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the company's estimated forecast of product demand and/or its ability to sell the product(s) concerned and production requirements. demand for the company's products can fluctuate significantly. factors which could affect demand for the company's products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. additionally, management's estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. income taxes - current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. the company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. if the company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the company's judgment. if the company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. see note 9 in notes to consolidated financial statements. newly issued accounting pronouncements information regarding newly issued accounting pronouncements is contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2005, which note is incorporated herein by this reference. sales the table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. * sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. a "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage. unit case volume of the company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company. sales of food bars and cereals, which have been discontinued and are not material, are expressed in actual cases. the company's quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. it has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. because the primary historical market for hansens products is california, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of hansen's products expands outside of california. the companys experience with its energy drink products, suggests that they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. as the percentage of the companys sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

the private security litigation reform act of 1995 (the "act") provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of section 27.a of the securities act 1933, as amended, and section 21.e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things. all statements which address operating performance, events or developments that management expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future including statements related to new products, volume growth, revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations, and/or the company's existing credit facility, earnings per share growth, statements expressing general optimism about future operating results and non historical information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the act. without limiting the foregoing, the words "believes", "thinks", "anticipates", "plans", "expects", and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 44 management cautions that these statements are qualified by their terms and/or important factors, many of which are outside our control, involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made including, but not limited to, those described in "part i item 1a. - risk factors" and other risks detailed from time to time in the company's reports filed with the securities and exchange commission. such factors are not exhaustive. our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. we expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. item 7a. qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) which the company is exposed to are fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and changes in interest rates of the company's long term debt and the limited availability of certain raw materials such as sucralose. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we are also subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectibility of accounts receivable. at december 31, 2005, the majority of the company's debt consisted of fixed rather than variable rate debt. the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the company's cash requirements. if average interest rates were to increase one percent for the year ended december 31, 2005, the net impact on the company's pre-tax earnings would have been insignificant. there have been no significant changes to the company's exposure to market risks.risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as the coca-cola company, pepsico inc., cadbury schweppes plc, red bull gmbh, kraft foods inc., nestle beverage company, tree top and ocean spray. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores. our java monster&trade; line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks competes directly with starbucks frappuccino and other coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, caribou coffee, cinnabon coffee drinks and godiva dairy based drinks. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the &ldquo;energy drink&rdquo; category could adversely affect our operating results. a substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our monster energy&reg; brand energy drinks. our dsd segment which comprises primarily energy drinks, represented 89.5% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2007. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy&reg; brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category. our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, full throttle, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, 180, extreme energy shot, red devil, rip it, nos, boo koo, vitaminenergy and many other brands. a number of companies who market and distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in different packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass bottles, including sobe, snapple elements, arizona, fuse, and vitamin water, have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products as &ldquo;functional&rdquo; or &ldquo;energy&rdquo; beverages or as having functional benefits. in addition, certain large companies such as the coca-cola company and pepsico inc. market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as pepsi max, mountain dew, mountain dew mdx and vault. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues or we could experience price erosion or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results. change in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. there is increasing awareness and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could affect our profitability. 19 consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. additionally, many of our products are considered premium products and to maintain market share during recessionary periods we may have to reduce profit margins which would adversely affect our results of operations. product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers' preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we also may be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. we do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. although our production arrangements are generally of short duration or are terminable upon request, in the event of a disruption or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited packing facilities in the united states with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including hansen&rsquo;s&reg; brand energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, our pet tea line, hansens&reg; sparkling beverages in 10.5-ounce sleek cans, aseptic juice products, juices in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles, monster energy&reg;, lost&reg; energy&trade;, ace&trade;, unbound energy&reg;, rumba tm and joker mad energy tm energy drinks in 8.3-ounce, 16-ounce, 24-ounce and 32-ounce cans, our java monster tm line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks in 15-ounce cans and other products. a disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing facilities in the united states with adequate capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. consequently, a disruption in production of such products could adversely affect our revenues. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our dsd products. if we are unable to secure such bottlers and distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. we continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including energy drinks. in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our dsd brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market and promote our products above the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 20 our customers are material to our success. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, and/or convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of the our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. two customers accounted for approximately 16% and 12%, and 19% and 12% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. one customer accounted for approximately 18% of our net sales for the year ended december 31, 2005. a decision by either customer, or any other large customer, to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us comprise aluminum cans, glass bottles and pet plastic bottles as well as juices, sucrose, cane sugar, sucralose, milk and cream, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations. due to the consolidations that have taken place in the glass industry over the past few years, the prices of glass bottles continue to increase. the prices of pet plastic bottles and certain aluminum cans increased in 2007. the prices of glucose, high fructose corn syrup, milk, cream and certain juice concentrates, including apple, increased significantly in 2007. these increased costs, together with increased costs primarily of energy and gas and freight resulted in increases in certain product costs, which are ongoing and are expected to continue to exert pressure on our gross margins in 2008. in addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients will continue to rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. in addition, some of these raw materials, such as a sucralose and certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. sucralose, which is used in many of our products including our low-calorie products, is purchased by us from a single manufacturer. while we believe that our 2008 sucralose volume allocation will be sufficient to meet the demand for our products that contain sucralose, we may need to reformulate certain of those products that contain sucralose with alternative sweetener systems to avoid an interruption in supply of those products, should the need arise. due to significant cost increases mainly for apple juice concentrate and pet plastic bottles, we are currently negotiating a mutually acceptable early termination of the wic contracts with the state of california. we have been informed that future contracts will not be granted on an exclusive basis and that certain manufacturers (including hbc) will be eligible to sell certain qualifying products to wic participants. the company is informed and believes that the wic program intends reducing the total quantity of fruit juice products that will be available to wic participants. we anticipate that as a consequence of the above, our revenue from these products is likely to be lower in the future. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, pet plastic bottles, cans, glass, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain sweeteners, or packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be 21 experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. we do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supplies contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as resin for pet bottles, aluminum for cans, pulp for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. accordingly, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. if we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. if we have to replace a flavor supplier, we could experience temporary disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in and to portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such property with registered and common law trademarks and copyrights, restrictions on disclosure and other actions to prevent infringement. product packages, mechanical designs and artwork are important to our success and we take action to protect against imitation of our packaging and trade dress and to protect our trademarks and copyrights as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. significant changes in government regulation may hinder sales. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products is subject to the federal food, drug and cosmetic act; the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. new statutes and regulations may also be instituted in the future. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or packaging changed, thus adversely affecting our financial condition and operations. california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state of california as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. while none of our beverage products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether 22 an important component of any of our products might be added to the california list in the future. we also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. if we are unable to maintain brand image or product quality, or if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to maintain and build brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. we have no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products' brand image and on consumer preferences. product quality issues, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if fake or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches. product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. while we have to date not experienced any credible product liability litigation, there is no assurance that we will not experience such litigation in the future. in the event we were to experience product liability claims or a product recall, our financial condition and business operations could be materially adversely effected. if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, or if our retailer's inventory levels are too high, our operating results will be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels will not be appropriate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance for any members of our senior management. we currently have employment agreements with mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer and mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, which end on december 31, 2008. the loss of services of either of these persons or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. weather could adversely affect our supply chain and demand for our products. with regard to fruit juice, fruit juice concentrates and natural flavors, the beverage industry is subject to variability of weather conditions, which may result in higher prices and/or the nonavailability of any of such items. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate, particularly in areas outside of california. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 23 potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers) could affect our products' affordability and reduce our sales. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other persons and many other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we may be unable to achieve analysts&rsquo; earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others. there can be no assurance that the company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. during our fiscal year ended december 31, 2007, our stock price high was $68.40 and stock price low was $32.50. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, on february 7, 2008, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to control a maximum of 20.9% of our outstanding common stock. consequently, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg could exercise significant control on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2007, we had $12.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $290.2 million in short- and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. government agencies, municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by u.s. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. our long-term investments are comprised of municipal or educational related or other public body notes with an auction reset feature (&ldquo;auction rate securities&rdquo;). these notes carry a aaa credit rating and certain of the notes are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which 24 allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. in february 2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. the auction failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand. in the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security generally requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that is above market rates for similar instruments. the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. as a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. consequently, these securities have been classified as long-term investments in our consolidated financial statements. however, we anticipate that due to the higher interest rates now payable on certain of these securities and for other reasons, the issuers will take steps to refinance their notes to

in august 2006, hbc filed a lawsuit against national beverage company, shasta beverages, inc., newbevco inc. and freek&rsquo;n beverage corp. (collectively &ldquo;national&rdquo;) seeking an injunction and damages for trademark infringement, trademark dilution, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices based on national&rsquo;s unauthorized use of hbc&rsquo;s valuable and distinctive monster energy&reg; trade dress in connection with a line of energy drinks it launched under the &ldquo;freek&rdquo; brand name. in june 2007, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement resolving the parties&rsquo; disputes in the litigation. national subsequently repudiated the settlement agreement and hbc responded by filing a motion in the united states district court for the central district of california to enforce the terms of the confidential settlement agreement. on august 14, 2007, the united states district court entered an order enforcing the settlement agreement and permanently enjoining national from manufacturing, distributing, shipping, marketing, selling and offering to sell &ldquo;freek&rdquo; energy drinks in containers using the original &ldquo;freek&rdquo; trade dress that was subject to the district court&rsquo;s preliminary injunction. national filed a notice of appeal with the ninth circuit court of appeals of the united states. national requested the district court to stay this order pending its appeal to the court of appeals for the ninth circuit, which was subsequently denied by the district court. the ninth circuit court of appeals has not yet docketed national&rsquo;s appeal. in august 2006, hbc filed an action in the federal courts of australia, victoria district registry against bickfords australia (pty) limited and meak (pty) ltd. (collectively &ldquo;bickfords&rdquo;), in which hbc is seeking an injunction restraining bickfords from selling or offering for sale or promoting 26 for sale in australia any energy drink or beverage under the monster energy or monster marks or any similar marks and for damages and costs. the defendants cross-claimed seeking an order to restrain hbc from selling, or offering for sale, or promoting in australia any drink product under the monster energy&reg; or monster&reg; trademarks or any similar trademarks and for costs. the trial took place in february 2007 and closing oral submissions took place in june 2007. the judge has not rendered his decision in the case to date. in september 2006, christopher chavez purporting to act on behalf of himself and a class of consumers yet to be defined filed an action in the united states district court, northern district of california, against the company and its subsidiaries for unfair business practices, false advertising, violation of california consumers legal remedies act, fraud, deceit and/or misrepresentation alleging that the company misleadingly labels its blue sky beverages as originating in and/or being canned under the authority of a company located in santa fe, new mexico. on june 11, 2007, the united states district court, northern district of california granted the company&rsquo;s motion to dismiss chavez&rsquo;s complaint with prejudice. in late june, mr. chavez noticed an appeal in the united states court of appeal for the ninth circuit. mr. chavez, as the appellant, has filed his opening brief and hansen&rsquo;s response has also been filed. the appeal has not been scheduled for hearing. during 2007, gate city beverage company (&ldquo;gate city&rdquo;), notified the company of its intention to sell its business and requested that the company consent to the assignment of the distribution agreement with the company. the company declined its consent and exercised its contractual right to terminate the gate city distribution agreement in accordance with its terms. gate city has disputed the company&rsquo;s right to refuse consent and to terminate the agreement and on february 6, 2008, filed arbitration proceedings to be held in orange county, california against the company for damages. the company disputes liability and is defending the claim. we are subject to litigation from time to time in the normal course of business, including claims from terminated distributors. although it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to us and after consultation with counsel, management believes that such litigation in the aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. derivative litigation - from november 2006 through january 2007, purported derivative lawsuits relating to the company&rsquo;s past stock option grants were filed by parties identifying themselves as shareholders of hansen. these lawsuits name as defendants certain of hansen&rsquo;s current and former employees, officers and directors, and name hansen as a nominal defendant. three of these cases, chandler v. sacks, et al.

beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and &ldquo;functional drinks,&rdquo; non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, children&rsquo;s multi-vitamin juice drinks, junior juice&reg; juices and flavored sparkling beverages under the hansen&rsquo;s&reg; brand name. we also develop, market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the following brand names; monster energy&reg;, lost&reg;

products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. we review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. the labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. during 2007, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. in particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. during the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the off-premise agreements with ab. under the off-premise agreements, select ab distributors distribute and sell, in markets designated by hbc, hbc&rsquo;s monster energy&reg;

$ 3,753 &sup1; net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements as a result of the late filings of our form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2006, our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2006, and our form 10-q for the three-months ended march 31, 2007, we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s-3 for sale by us or resale by others until we have been current in our reporting obligations for a period of approximately one year. we expect to be eligible to register our securities on form s-3 after july 1, 2008. the inability to use form s-3 could adversely affect our ability to raise capital during this period. however, we are still eligible to register our securities on form s-1. if we fail to timely file a future periodic report with the sec and our stock were to be delisted, it could severely impact our ability to raise future capital and could have an adverse impact on our overall future liquidity. we again achieved record gross sales in 2007. the increase in gross sales in 2007 was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of certain of our existing products, particularly our monster energy&reg; brand energy drinks and to sales by volume or our java monster tm line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks. the percentage increase in gross sales was lower than the percentage increase in net sales, primarily due to a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, which decreased from 13.0% to 11.8%. the actual amount of promotional and other allowances increased to $121.3 million from $90.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2007 and december 31, 2006, respectively. a substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our monster energy&reg; brand energy drinks. any decrease in sales of our monster energy&reg; brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. competitive pressure in the &ldquo;energy drink&rdquo; category could adversely affect our operating results. (see &ldquo;part i, item 1a. - risk factors&rdquo;) during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase for our monster energy&reg; brand energy drinks and our java monster&trade; line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective january 1, 2008. we estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our gross sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. we did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. as a result, our future sales and operating results may be negatively impacted as a result of higher than normal distribution channel inventory levels. (see &ldquo;part i, item 1a. - risk factors&rdquo;) gross sales shipped outside of california represented 72.0%, 67.8% and 61.5% of our gross sales, for the years ended december 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. gross sales to customers outside the united states amounted to $41.0 million, $19.3 million and $5.6 million for the years ended 35 december 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. such sales were approximately 4.0%, 2.8% and 1.3% of gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. our customers are typically retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers. gross sales to our various customer types for 2007, 2006 and 2005 are reflected below. the allocations below reflect changes made by the company to the categories historically reported. 2007 2006 2005 retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 8% 12% 19% club stores, drug chains &amp; mass merchandisers 14% 14% 11% full service distributors 73% 69% 65% health food distributors 2% 2% 3% other 3% 3% 2% our customers include cadbury schweppes bottling group (formally known as dr. pepper bottling/7up bottling group), wal-mart, inc. (including sam&rsquo;s club), ab, kalil bottling group, trader joe&rsquo;s, john lenore &amp; company, pepsi canada, swire coca-cola, usa, costco, the kroger co., safeway inc. and albertsons. a decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the company or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. cadbury schweppes bottling group, a customer of the dsd division, accounted for approximately 16%, 19% and 18% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. wal-mart, inc. (including sam&rsquo;s club), a customer of both the dsd and warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 12% of the company&rsquo;s net sales for each of the years ended december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. in october 2006, we acquired the unbound energy&reg; trademark and assumed the production, marketing and sale of unbound energy &reg; energy drinks in 16-ounce cans. we subsequently introduced a lo-carb and juice version in 16-ounce cans. during 2004, we entered into exclusive wic contracts with the state of california to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles. the wic contracts commenced on july 12, 2004 and were due to expire in july 2007. the parties mutually agreed to extend the wic contracts until july 11, 2008. wic-approved items are stocked by the grocery trade and by wic-only stores. products are purchased by wic consumers with vouchers given by the dhs to qualified participants. due to significant cost increases mainly for apple juice concentrates and pet plastic bottles, we are currently negotiating a mutually acceptable earlier termination of the wic contracts with the state of california. we have been informed that future wic contracts will not be granted on an exclusive basis and that certain manufacturers (including hbc) will be eligible to sell certain qualifying products to wic participants. the company is informed and believes that the wic program intends reducing the total quantity of fruit juice products that will be available to wic participants. we anticipate that as a consequence of the above, our revenue from these products is likely to be lower in the future. however, we do not believe that such reduction in revenue will have a material impact on our future operations. (see &ldquo;part i, item 1. business &ndash; manufacture and distribution&rdquo;). we continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. value drivers of our business we believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: &bull; profitable growth &ndash; we believe functional, better for you brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. we 36 continue to broaden our family of brands. in particular, we are expanding and growing our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. we are focused on maintaining profit margins. we believe that tailored brand, package, price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. we are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. &bull; cost management &ndash; the principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction. one key area of focus, for example, is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. another key area of focus is the reduction in inventory levels. however, due to the expansion in the number of our products, increased sales levels in 2007, and the conclusion of the agreements with ab, overall inventory levels increased. during 2007, the costs of pet plastic bottles and certain aluminum cans, as well as the costs of glucose, high fructose corn syrup, certain juice concentrates, including apple, and certain packaging and freight costs also increased. &bull; efficient capital structure &ndash; our capital structure is intended to optimize our costs of capital. we believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost and overall low costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. we believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in (1) maintaining our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. the ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. in 2007, gross sales totaled $1,025.8 million, a 47.3% increase over 2006. net sales totaled $904.5 million in 2007, an increase of 49.3% over 2006. gross profit totaled $468.0 million in 2007, a 47.8% increase from 2006. operating income totaled $231.0 million in 2007, an increase of 45.7% from 2006. net income totaled $149.4 million in 2007, a 52.5% increase from 2006. net income per diluted share was $1.51 as compared to net income per diluted share of $0.99 in 2006. these measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2008 and beyond. see also &ldquo;results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2007 compared to the year ended december 31, 2006.&rdquo; in 2007, the company had working capital of $187.3 million compared to $212.3 million as of december 31, 2006. in 2007, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $135.5 million as compared to $76.4 million in 2006. principal uses of cash flows are purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and trademarks. payment of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. (see also &ldquo;part ii, item 7. - liquidity and capital resources&rdquo;). opportunities, challenges and risks looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our company. increase in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. we recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. we continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. 37 our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences. in addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our company&rsquo;s future financial results include, but are not limited to: &bull; the impact of the slowing economy in the united states and other countries in which we operate; &bull; maintenance of our brand images and product quality; &bull; profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (see also &ldquo;part i, item 1. - business - competition and sales and marketing&rdquo;); &bull; restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; &bull; protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; &bull; limitations on available quantities of sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener that is used in many of our beverage products, due to demand for such sweetener exceeding the supplier&rsquo;s production capacity, as well as limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap can, the 32-ounce can and copacking availability; &bull; the imposition of additional restrictions. (see also &ldquo;part i, item 1a. - risk factors&rdquo;) for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company. we believe that the following opportunities exist for us: &bull; growth potential for the alternative beverage category including energy drinks, sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water; &bull; new product introductions intended to contribute to higher profitability; &bull; premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; &bull; significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; &bull; proper positioning to capture industry growth; and &bull; broadening distribution/expansion opportunities. 38 results of operations percentage change 2007 2006 2005 07 vs. 06 06 vs. 05 gross sales, net of discounts &amp;

brand energy drinks, which include monster energy&reg; drinks (introduced in april 2002), lo-carb monster energy&reg; drinks (introduced in august 2003), monster energy&reg; assault tm energy drinks (introduced in september 2004) and monster energy&reg; khaos tm energy drinks (introduced in august 2005), as well as sales of certain new products such as the java monster&trade; line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in april 2007), monster m-80 tm energy drinks (introduced in march 2007), monster mixxd&trade; energy drinks (introduced in december 2007) and monster heavy metal&trade; energy drinks (introduced in november 2007). to a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, unbound energy &reg; energy drinks (introduced in october 2006) and junior juice&reg; aseptic juices. the increase in gross sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of lost energy&reg; drinks (introduced in january 2004), iced teas, joker mad energy&trade; drinks (introduced in january 2005) and hansen's&reg; fruit juice smoothies. changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales for the year ended december 31, 2007. however, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase for our monster energy&reg; brand energy drinks and our java monster&trade; line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective january 1, 2008. we estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our gross sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. promotional and other allowances were $121.3 million for 2007, an increase of $30.8 million or 34.0% higher than promotional and other allowances of $90.5 million for 2006. promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased to 11.8% in 2007 from 13.0% in 2006. as a result, the percentage increase in gross sales in 2007 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *gross sales &ndash; see definition above. net sales. net sales were $904.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $298.7 million or 49.3% higher than net sales of $605.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2006. the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our monster energy&reg;

brand energy drinks and our java monster&trade; line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective january 1, 2008. we estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 98.5 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2007, an increase of 25.7 million cases or 35.3% higher than case sales of 72.7 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2006. the overall average net sales price per case increased to $9.19 for 2007 or 10.3% higher than the average net sales price per case of $8.33 for 2006. the increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. 40 net sales for the dsd segment were $809.8 million for year ended december 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $295.5 million or 57.5% higher than net sales of $514.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2006. the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our monster energy&reg;

drinks. changes in pricing within the dsd segment did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended december 31, 2007. however, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase to our monster energy&reg; brand energy drinks and our java monster&trade; line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective january 1, 2008. we estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. net sales for the warehouse segment were $94.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $3.2 million or 3.5% higher than net sales of $91.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2006. the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, sodas and junior juice&reg; aseptic juices. the increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of iced teas, smoothies in cans and hansen&rsquo;s&reg; energy drinks. changes in pricing within the warehouse segment did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended december 31, 2007. gross profit.** * gross profit was $468.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $151.4 million or 47.8% higher than the gross profit of $316.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2006. gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 51.7% for 2007 as compared to 52.3% for 2006. increases in sales volumes contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of sales within the dsd segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. to a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners, certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates and increased reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory. such decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased sales of dsd segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the warehouse segment, a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales. ***gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. operating expenses . total operating expenses were $237.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $79.0 million or 50.0% higher than total operating expenses of $158.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2006. total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 26.2% for 2007, slightly higher than 26.1% for 2006. the increase in operating expenses in dollars was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $8.7 million primarily due to increased volume of shipments, increased expenditures of $18.4 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $10.3 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $4.9 million for sampling programs, increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased expenditures of $8.6 million for professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees, and increased expenditures of $2.5 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. included in legal and accounting fees are costs of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributor and exlcusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of 2.5 million in 41 insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 23.4% for both 2007 and 2006. contribution margin. contribution margin for the dsd segment was $281.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $93.8 million or 49.9% higher than contribution margin of $187.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2006. the increase in contribution margin for the dsd segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of monster energy&reg;

(&ldquo;sfas no. 123r&rdquo;) which was not expensed in the previous year including a cumulative adjustment of $1.3 million related to stock based compensation and related charges (see part ii, item 8, note 9, &ldquo;commitments and contingencies &ndash; other&rdquo;), an increase in payroll expenses of $5.3 million, and an increase of $5.2 million in professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees. included in legal and accounting fees are costs of $3.8 million relating to the company&rsquo;s special investigation of stock option grants. contribution margin. contribution margin represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can be directly attributed to segment net sales. contribution margin for the dsd segment was $187.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9 million or 72.4% higher than contribution margin of $109.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in contribution margin for the dsd segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of monster energy&reg; brand energy drinks. contribution margin for the warehouse segment was $6.1 million for 2006, a decrease of approximately $4.3 million or 41.0% lower than contribution margin of $10.4 million for 2005. the decrease in the contribution margin for the warehouse segment was primarily attributable to reduced sales of hansen&rsquo;s&reg; energy drinks and a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw materials and production. operating income. operating income was $158.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $55.2 million or 53.4% higher than operating income of $103.4 million for 44 the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in operating income was attributable to higher gross profit, which was offset by increased selling, distribution, general and administrative expenses. operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.2% for 2006 from 29.6% for 2005. the decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. interest and other income, net . net interest and other income was $3.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of $2.3 million from net interest income of $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in net interest and other income was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on the company&rsquo;s invested cash balances which have increased significantly over the year. provision for income taxes . provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2006 was $64.3 million as compared to provision for income taxes of $42.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2006 was 39.6%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 40.1% for 2005. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that are exempt from federal income taxes and certain federal tax credits relating to export sales, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in state taxes due to the apportionment of sales to various states outside of california which have lower state tax rates. this decrease was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive stock options for which we received no tax benefit. net income . net income was $97.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of $35.1 million or 56.0% higher than net income of $62.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in net income was attributable to the increase in gross profit of approximately $134.1 million and the increase in net interest income of approximately $2.3 million, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of approximately $22.3 million. liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities &ndash; net cash provided by operating activities was $135.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, as compared to $76.4 million in the comparable period in 2006. for 2007, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $149.4 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $10.2 million of share-based compensation and $2.1 million of depreciation and other amortization. in 2007, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $31.8 million increase in income taxes payable, a $22.4 million increase in accounts payable, a $19.1 million increase in deferred revenue and a $1.5 million increase in accrued compensation. in 2007, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $29.5 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options, a $26.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $21.1 million increase in inventories, a $14.2 million increase in deferred income taxes, a $0.1 million decrease in accrued liabilities and a $3.2 million decrease in customer deposit liabilities. the increase in accounts receivable was attributable to increased sales volumes as well as to increased sales to certain classes of customers who have longer payment terms. the increase in inventory is attributable to the addition of new copackers and warehouses, the introduction of new products and planned inventory levels to meet consumer demand. cash flows used in investing activities &ndash; net cash used in investing activities was $194.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, as compared to $95.2 million used in investing activities in the comparable period in 2006. for 2007, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short- and long-term investments, particularly available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments. cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments. for both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, computer and office furniture 45 and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as wells as certain leasehold improvements. management expects that it will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations, for purchasing short- and long-term investments and for other corporate purposes. management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of the company&rsquo;s brands. at december 31, 2007, we had $12.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $290.2 million in short- and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. government agencies, municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by u.s. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. our short-term investments include variable rate demand notes. although the underlying maturities of these securities are long-term in nature, the investments are classified as short-term because they contain a &lsquo;put&rsquo; feature which allows the holder to tender the securities at par on seven days notice. the &lsquo;put&rsquo; feature is supported by a letter of credit or standby purchase agreement provided by a highly-rated commercial bank. the notes are issued by municipalities and other tax-exempt entities and the interest rate payable on these investments resets on a weekly basis. all of our short-term investments are held by major financial institutions. our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities. these notes carry a aaa credit rating and certain of the notes are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. in february 2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. the auction failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand. in the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security generally requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that is above market rates for similar instruments. the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. as a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. consequently these securities have been classified as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements. however, we anticipate that due to the higher interest rates now payable on certain of these securities and for other reasons, the issuers will take steps to refinance their notes to enable them to call and repay the securities and therefore avoid the higher interest rates now payable on such securities. if the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. we may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments&rsquo; recorded value. (see also &ldquo;part i, item 1a. risk factors- our investments in marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments &rdquo; and &ldquo;part i, item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks&rdquo;). 46 cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities &ndash; net cash provided by financing activities was $36.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $7.7 million for the comparable period in 2006. for 2007, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $29.5 million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and proceeds of $8.2 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. debt and other obligations &ndash; hbc has entered into a credit facility with comerica bank (&ldquo;comerica&rdquo;) consisting of a revolving line of credit which was amended in may 2007. in accordance with the amended provisions of the credit facility, hbc increased its available borrowings under the revolving line of credit to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. the revolving line of credit is effective through june 1, 2008. interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on comerica&rsquo;s base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying libor rates up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by hbc. we had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at december 31, 2007. letters of credit issued on behalf of the company totaling $0.3 million under this credit facility were outstanding as of december 31, 2007. the terms of the company&rsquo;s line of credit contain certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. the company was in compliance with its covenants at december 31, 2007. if any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. (see also &ldquo;part ii, item 8 - note 9, commitments &amp; contingencies&rdquo;). purchase commitments include obligations made by the company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. these obligations vary in terms. the following represents a summary of the company&rsquo;s contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of december 31, 2007: payments due by period (in thousands) obligations total less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years more than 5 years noncancelable contracts $ 45,317 $ 26,052 $ 17,552 $ 1,713 $ - capital leases 663 663 - - - operating leases 23,482 3,338 8,024 4,533 7,587 purchase commitments 7,428 7,428 - - - $ 76,890 $ 37,481 $ 25,576 $ 6,246 $ 7,587 in addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the company and rexam beverage can company (&ldquo;rexam&rdquo;), dated as of january 1, 2006, the company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period commencing from january 1, 2006 through december 31, 2009. should the company fail to purchase the minimum volume, the company will be obligated to reimburse rexam for certain 47 capital reimbursements on a pro-rated basis. the company&rsquo;s maximum liability under this agreement is $6.0 million, subject to compliance by rexam with a number of conditions under this agreement. management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. based on the company&rsquo;s current plans, at this time the company estimates that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $10.0 million through december 2008. however, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. in september 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased offices in corona, california. in october 2006, we also entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in corona, california. this lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months, commencing march 2007, excluding renewal options. the monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. the new warehouse and distribution space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located in corona, california. in october 2006, we entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. the property is located adjacent to the newly leased warehouse and distribution space. we are reviewing the feasibility of constructing a new office building on such land, which will replace our existing office space. we have sublet in excess of 50% of our previous office, warehouse and distribution space for the remainder of that lease term which expires in october 2010. accounting policies and pronouncements critical accounting policies the company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements, including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks, as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. the following summarizes the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the company: accounts receivable &ndash; the company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. in circumstances where the company becomes aware of a specific customer&rsquo;s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the company believes will ultimately be collected. in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the company&rsquo;s recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. inventories &ndash; inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. the company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the company's estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or its ability to sell the product(s) concerned. demand for the company's products can fluctuate significantly. factors that could affect demand for the company's products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors that may result in 48 cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. additionally, management's estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. long-lived assets &ndash;management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. this review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. if there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. the fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management&rsquo;s estimates of the business risks. no impairments were identified as of december 31, 2007. management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a &ldquo;critical accounting estimate&rdquo; because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. management&rsquo;s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. intangibles &ndash; intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the company&rsquo;s exclusive ownership of the hansen&rsquo;s&reg; trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the monster energy&reg; trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. the company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the united states, as well as in a number of countries around the world. the company also owns the blue sky&reg; trademark, which was acquired in september 2000, and the junior juice&reg; trademark, which was acquired in may 2001. during 2002, the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard (&ldquo;sfas&rdquo;) no. 142, &ldquo;goodwill and other intangible assets&rdquo;. under the provisions on sfas no. 142, the company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 25 years. in accordance with sfas no. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. if there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. an impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. the fair value is calculated using the income approach. however, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. based on management&rsquo;s impairment analysis performed for the year ended december 31, 2007, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying value. in estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. foreign currency translation and transactions &ndash; the accounts of the company&rsquo;s foreign subsidiary are translated in accordance with sfas no. 52, &ldquo;foreign currency translation&rdquo;. the company has determined that the functional currency of its subsidiary should be its local 49 currency. the accounts of this foreign subsidiary have been translated into united states dollars using the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and at the average exchange rate for the period for revenues and expenses. cumulative translation gains or losses are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&rsquo; equity. foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in interest and other income, net, at the time they occur. gains and losses incurred during the year ended december 31, 2007 were insignificant. revenue recognition &ndash; the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. generally, ownership of and title to the company&rsquo;s products passes to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. certain of the company&rsquo;s distributors may also perform a separate function as a copacker on the company&rsquo;s behalf. in such cases, ownership of and title to the company&rsquo;s products that are copacked on the company&rsquo;s behalf by those copackers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when the company is notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of the company&rsquo;s finished goods. net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with emerging issues task force issue (&ldquo;eitf&rdquo;) no. 01-09, &ldquo;accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer (including a reseller of the vendor&rsquo;s products)&rdquo;. management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the company&rsquo;s historical experience. cost of sales &ndash; cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the company&rsquo;s finished products and certain quality control costs. raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. operating expenses &ndash; operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the company&rsquo;s prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. stock-based compensation &ndash; beginning in fiscal year 2006, the company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. the company uses the black-scholes-merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. the black-scholes-merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. the company&rsquo;s employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. for example, employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. in addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. the company uses historical data to estimate the expected price 50 volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. the risk-free rate is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. if actual results are not consistent with the company&rsquo;s assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to its results of operations. income taxes &ndash; current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. the company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. if the company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the company's judgment. if the company subsequently determines that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. newly issued accounting pronouncements in september 2006, the financial accounting standards board (&ldquo;fasb&rdquo;) issued sfas no. 157, &ldquo;fair value measurements&rdquo; , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. the provisions of sfas no. 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. the fasb has deferred the implementation of sfas no. 157 by one year for certain non-financial assets and liabilities such that this will be effective for the fiscal year beginning january 1, 2009. the company is currently evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no. 157 on its consolidated financial statements. in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 159, &ldquo;the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no. 115&rdquo; (sfas no. 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. the provisions of sfas no.159 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no. 159 on its consolidated financial statements. sales the table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. a &ldquo;unit case&rdquo; means a unit of measurement equal to 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage. unit case volume of the company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company. sales of food bars and cereals, which have been discontinued and are not material, are expressed in actual cases. the company&rsquo;s quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. it has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. because the primary historical market for hansen&rsquo;s products is california, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of hansen&rsquo;s products expands outside of california. the company&rsquo;s experience with its energy drink products, suggests that they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. as the percentage of the company&rsquo;s sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, 51 seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

risk factors,&rdquo; for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. we expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which the company is exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar, glucose, sucrose, milk and cream, and high fructose corn syrup, which are used in many of the company&rsquo;s products), changes in interest rates on the company&rsquo;s long-term debt and limited availability of certain raw materials such as sucralose. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. in addition, we are subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of accounts receivable. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. we do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, including, but not limited to, cans, pet plastic bottles, glass, labels, sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, glucose, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain sweeteners or packaging arrangements, or protecting against shortages of such ingredients or raw materials. we are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short term investments. certain of our short term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. as a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. 54 at december 31, 2007, we had $12.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $290.2 million in short- and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. government agencies, municipal securities or notes (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by u.s. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (see also &ldquo;part i, item 1a. risk factors &ndash; our investments in marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments&rdquo;

natural sodas. hansen natural sodas have been a leading natural soda brand in southern california for the past 25 years. in 2006, according to information resources, inc. analyzer reports for

grocery chains, club stores, specialty retail chains and mass merchandisers and to the health food sector through specialty and health food distributors (collectively referred to as our direct retail customers ). signature soda is available in 12-ounce glass bottles in four flavors: orange cr me, vanilla cr me, ginger beer and sarsaparilla. 4 in september 2000, we acquired the blue sky natural

2001, we introduced a new line of sparkling lemonades (regular and pink) and orangeades in unique proprietary 1-liter glass bottles and towards the end of 2002, we introduced diet versions of these products. in 2003, we extended this line into unique proprietary 12-ounce glass bottles in both regular and diet versions. this product line was marketed to our direct retail customers. the contract packer who produced these products on our behalf underwent a change of ownership, and experienced production difficulties in 2003, and as a result we discontinued this product line. we are currently evaluating alternative packages for this line. in 2006, we introduced a new line of hansen green tea sodas under the hansen brand name in 16-ounce aluminum cans that contain no preservatives, sodium, caffeine or artificial colors, in four flavors; ginger, lemon mint, tangerine and pomegranate. we also introduced a diet version that contains no carbohydrates or sugar in three flavors; tangerine, lemon mint, ginger and in 2007, introduced an additional diet flavor, pomegranate. hansen energy drinks. in 1997, we introduced a lightly carbonated citrus flavored hansen energy drink in 8.3-ounce cans in 4 packs. our energy drink competes in the functional beverage category, namely, beverages that provide a real or perceived benefit in addition to simply delivering refreshment. we also offered additional functional energy drinks as well as other functional drinks including a ginger flavored d-stress drink, an orange flavored b-well drink, a guarana berry flavored stamina drink, a grape

reintroduced our energy products through the warehouse segment and introduced hansen energy pro 8.3-ounce cans in four packs. in 2001, we introduced energade , a non-carbonated energy sports drink in 23.5-ounce cans in two flavors, citrus and orange, 5 and subsequently introduced a third flavor, red rocker, which we have since discontinued. in 2001 we also introduced e 2 o energy water , a non-carbonated lightly flavored water, in 24-ounce blue pet plastic bottles, in four flavors: tangerine, apple, berry and lemon. we subsequently discontinued the apple flavor and introduced a green tea flavor in its place. in 2002, we expanded our e 2 o energy water line with four additional flavors in clear pet plastic bottles: mango melon, kiwi strawberry, grapefruit and green tea. we have since discontinued the e 2 o energy water line in clear pet plastic bottles. our energade and e 2 o energy water drinks also contain different combinations and levels of supplements. at the end of 2002, we introduced a lightly carbonated diet energy drink in 8.3-ounce cans under the hansen diet red energy brand name. our diet red energy energy drink is sweetened with splenda and acesulfame-k. we market our energy and energade drinks primarily through our full service distributor network. we market our e 2 o energy water drinks in blue bottles to our direct retail customers and are currently in the process of revaluating this line. in 2003, we introduced a new carbonated energy drink under the hansen deuce brand name, in 16-ounce cans, but with a different flavor from our existing hansen energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans. we have since discontinued this product. monster energy drinks. in 2002, we launched a new carbonated energy drink under the monster energy brand name, in 16-ounce cans, which was almost double the size of our regular energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans and the vast majority of competitive energy drinks on the market at that time. our monster energy drink contains different types and levels of supplements than our hansen energy drinks and is marketed through our full service distributor network. in 2003, we introduced a low carbohydrate ( lo-carb

energy drinks in 8.3-ounce size cans. during the first quarter 2007 we introduced a new monster m-80 energy drink in 16-ounce size cans. monster m-80 energy drinks are lightly carbonated and contain 80% juice. we also introduced monster energy energy drinks in 8-packs. lost energy drinks. in 2004, we launched a new carbonated energy drink under the lost brand name, in 16-ounce cans. towards the end of 2005, we introduced a lo-carb version of lost under the perfect 10 brand name as well as a new lost five-o energy drink, all in 16-ounce cans. lost five-o contains 50% juice and is lightly carbonated. in december 2005, we introduced lost and lost five-o in 24-ounce size cans. the lost brand name is owned by lost international llc and the drinks are produced, sold and distributed by us under exclusive license from lost international llc. rumba energy juice. in december 2004, we launched a new non-carbonated energy juice under the rumba brand name in 15.5-ounce cans. rumba energy juice is a 100% juice product that targets male and female morning beverage consumers and is positioned as a substitute for coffee, caffeinated sodas and 100% orange or other juices. joker mad energy drinks. in the first quarter of 2005, we introduced joker mad energy energy drinks in 16-ounce cans. joker mad energy energy drinks come in regular, lo-carb and juice versions in 16-ounce cans. ace energy drinks. in august 2006, we introduced ace energy drinks in 16-ounce cans. ace energy drinks come in regular, lo-carb and juice versions in 16-ounce cans. 6 unbound energy drinks. in october 2006, we acquired the unbound energy trademark and assumed the production, marketing and sale of unbound energy energy drinks in 16-ounce cans. we subsequently introduced lo-carb and juice versions in 16-ounce cans. java monster coffee drinks . in may 2007, we launched a new non-carbonated dairy based coffee drink under the java monster brand name in 16-ounce cans. java monster comes in three versions, big black, loca moca and mean bean. juice products and smoothies . our fruit juice product line includes hansen natural apple juice, which is packaged in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles and 128-ounce polypropylene bottles and white grape, white grape peach, purple grape, orange, pomegranate, apple strawberry and apple grape juice blends, in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles. these hansen juice products contain 100% juice (except pomegranate which contains 27% juice) as well as vitamin c. hansen juice products compete in the shelf-stable juice category. we also offer light juices (light grape, cranberry and apple) and juice cocktails (apple medley, apple pear, apple berry and apple white grape) in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles, as well as juice cocktails (apple cranberry, apple white grape, apple berry and apple) in 32-ounce pet plastic bottles. in march 1995, we introduced a line of fruit juice smoothie drinks in 11.5-ounce aluminum cans. certain flavors were subsequently offered in glass and pet plastic bottles. we have since discontinued offering smoothies in glass and pet plastic bottle packages. hansen fruit juice smoothies have a smooth texture that is thick but lighter than a nectar. in 2006, we reformulated hansen smoothies by adding more fruit purees. hansen smoothies in 11.5-ounce aluminum cans now contain approximately 25% juice. our fruit juice smoothies provide 100% of the recommended daily intake for adults of vitamins a, c &amp; e and represented hansen entry into what is commonly referred to as the functional beverage category. hansen fruit juice smoothies are available in ten flavors: strawberry banana, peach berry, mango pineapple, guava strawberry, pineapple coconut, apricot nectar, tropical passion, whipped orange, as well as the blast line comprising island energy blast and colada energy blast. in 2004, we repositioned our cranberry raspberry lite smoothie as part of our new lo-carb line of smoothies. our lo-carb smoothie line currently consists of peach, mango and cran-raspberry flavors in 12-ounce cans. we market the above juice and smoothie products to our direct retail customers. sparkling apple cider . in 2002, we introduced a sparkling cider 100% juice drink in a 1.5- liter magnum glass bottle. however, due to reports of some bottles breaking, we promptly voluntarily recalled this product in the fourth quarter of 2003. we still intend to reevaluate relaunching this product once certain production issues are resolved and a suitable co-packer has been identified. iced teas, lemonades and juice cocktails. we introduced hansen ready-to-drink iced teas and lemonades in 1993 and juice cocktails in 1994 in 16-ounce glass bottles. at the end of 2002, we converted this line from 16-ounce glass bottles to 16-ounce polypropylene bottles. this line was discontinued in 2006. in 1999, we introduced a line of specialty teas in 20-ounce glass bottles, which we named our gold standard line. this line was discontinued in 2006. in 2006, we introduced a new line of iced teas in sleek 16-ounce wide mouth pet plastic bottles. this line is sweetened with cane sugar and includes green tea, peach green tea, lycee green tea and pomegranate green tea. in addition, we offer a sugar free peach green tea with sucralose and an unsweetened black tea. juices for children. in 1999, we introduced two new lines of children multi-vitamin juice drinks in 8.45-ounce aseptic boxes. each drink contains eleven essential vitamins and six essential minerals. we introduce new flavors in place of existing flavors from time to time. one of these two 7 lines is a dual-branded 100% juice line named juice blast that was launched in conjunction with costco wholesale corporation ( costco ) and is sold through costco stores. the other line was a 10% juice line named hansen natural multi-vitamin juice slam that was available to all of our customers. during 2000, we repositioned that line as a 100% juice line under the juice slam name and market that line to grocery store chain customers, the health food trade, and other customers. both the juice blast and juice slam lines are marketed in 6.75-ounce aseptic boxes. the juice slam line has four flavors and the juice blast line has three flavors. in 2003 we further extended our fruit juice product line by introducing a 100% apple juice in 6.75-ounce aseptic pouches under the apple blasters brand. in 2006 we discontinued our apple blasters product and repositioned our pouch line by introducing two juice slam organic pouches in organic apple and organic fruit punch flavors. in may 2001, we acquired the junior juice beverage business. the junior juice product line is comprised of seven flavors of 100% juice in 4.23-ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. six flavors of the junior juice line have calcium added and all flavors have vitamin c added. the current flavors in the junior juice line are apple, apple berry, orange twist, apple grape, mixed fruit, fruit punch and white grape. in 2006, we extended the junior juice line by adding organic apple and organic berry medley juice products in 4.23-ounce aseptic boxes. each of our organic junior juice products have 100% juice and contain 100% of the daily recommended allowance of vitamin c and 10% of the daily recommended allowance of calcium. bottled water. our still water products were introduced in 1993 and are primarily sold in 0.5-liter plastic bottles to the food service trade. sales of this product line are very limited. fizzit powdered drink mixes. in december 2005, we introduced a new line of vitamin and mineral drink mixes in powdered form under the fizzit brand name in both functional and vitamin and mineral formulas. the functional formulas are offered in raspberry (joint formula), orange (immune support formula), strawberry (immune support formula) and cranberry (women health formula). the vitamin and mineral formula is offered in lemon line and strawberry flavors. during 2006, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. in particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the alternative beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. other products we continue to evaluate and, where considered appropriate, introduce additional flavors and other types of beverages to complement our existing product lines. we will also evaluate, and may, where considered appropriate, introduce functional foods/snack foods that utilize similar channels of distribution and/or are complementary to our existing products and/or to which our brand names are able to add value. we also develop and supply, on a limited basis, selected beverages in different formats to a limited number of customers with the objective of solidifying our relationship with those customers. manufacture and distribution we do not directly manufacture our products but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third party bottlers and contract packers. 8 we purchase concentrates, juices, flavors, supplements, cans, bottles, aseptic boxes, aseptic pouches, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our beverage products which are delivered to our various third party bottlers and co-packers. depending on the product, the third party bottlers or packers add filtered water and/or high fructose corn syrup, or sucrose, or cane sugar or splenda brand sweetener, acesulfame-k and/or citric acid or other ingredients and supplements for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into approved containers in accordance with our formulas. in the case of sodas and other carbonated beverages, the bottler/packer adds carbonation to the products as part of the production process. we are generally responsible for arranging for the purchase of and delivery to our third party bottlers and co-packers of the containers in which our beverage products are packaged. all of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the united states and canada under separate arrangements with each of such parties. the majority of our co-packaging arrangements are on a month-to-month basis. however, certain of our material co-packing arrangements are described below: (a) our agreement with gluek brewing company ( gluek ) pursuant to which gluek packages certain of our energy drinks in 8.3-, 15.5-, 16- and 24-ounce cans. this contract continues until august 2008 and is automatically renewed for one year periods thereafter. either party is entitled at any time to terminate the agreement upon 180 days prior written notice to the other party. (b) our agreement with seven-up/rc bottling company of southern california, inc. ( seven-up ) pursuant to which seven-up packages certain of our monster tm and lost energy brand energy drinks and a portion of our hansen natural sodas . this contract continues until march 2009. upon termination prior to such time we are entitled to recover certain equipment we have purchased and installed at seven-up facility. (c) our agreement with city brewing company llc ( city brew ) pursuant to which city brew packages certain of our energade energy sports drinks and energy drinks in 16- and 24-ounce cans. this contract continues until july 31, 2007. either party is entitled, at any time, to terminate the agreement upon 90 days prior written notice to the other party. (d) our agreement with nor-cal beverage co., inc. ( nor-cal ) pursuant to which nor-cal packages certain of our hansen juices in pet plastic bottles. this contract continues until august 2007 and is renewable annually thereafter from year-to-year unless terminated by hansen not less than 60 days before the end of the then current term. (e) our agreement with whitlock packaging, inc. (wpi) pursuant to which wpi packages certain of our 4.23-ounce and 6.75-ounce aseptic juice beverages which include junior juice, juice slam and juice blast. this contract, which commenced on january 1, 2001, is renewable annually thereafter and may be terminated by either party with not less than 60 days notice. (f) our agreement with dr. pepper bottling co. ( dr. pepper ) pursuant to which dr. pepper packages certain of our energy drinks in 16-ounce cans. this contract continues until december 31, 2009 and is renewable annually thereafter, unless terminated by either party with not less than 30 days notice. (g) our agreement with lucerne foods, inc. ( safeway-norwalk ) pursuant to which safeway-norwalk packages certain of our energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and hansen natural sodas in 12- ounce cans. this contract continues until march 31, 2009 and is renewable annually thereafter unless terminated by either party not less than 6 months. (h) our agreement with pri-pak, inc. ( pri-pak ) pursuant to which pri-pak packages certain of our energy drinks. this contract continues indefinitely but may be terminated at any time by either party upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other. 9 (i) our agreement with carolina beer &amp; beverage pursuant to which carolina beer &amp; beverage packages certain of our energy drinks in 8-ounce, 16-ounce and 24-ounce cans. this contract continues until april 10, 2009 and is renewable annually thereafter, unless terminated by either party with not less than 180 days notice. (j) our agreement with southeast atlantic beverage corporation ( southeast ) pursuant to which southeast packages certain of our monster energy and lost energy brand energy drinks. this contract continues until july 2007 and is renewable annually thereafter, unless terminated by either party not less than 180 days prior to the end of the then current term. (k) our agreement with southwest canning and packaging, inc. ( southwest ) pursuant to which southwest packages certain of our hansen natural sodas . this contract continues indefinitely and is subject to termination upon 60 days written notice from either party. (l) our agreement with olympic foods, inc. ( ofi ) pursuant to which ofi packages certain of our 4.23-ounce and 6.75-ounce aseptic juice beverages which include junior juice, juice slam and juice blast. this contract continues until january 1, 2008 and is renewable annually thereafter, unless terminated by either party not less than 120 days. in certain instances, equipment is purchased by us and installed at the facilities of our co-packers to enable them to produce certain of our products. in general, such equipment remains our property and is to be returned to us upon termination of the packing arrangements with such co-packers or is amortized over a pre-determined number of cases that are to be produced at the facilities concerned. we pack certain products outside of the west coast region to enable us to produce products closer to the markets where they are sold and thereby reduce freight costs. as volumes in markets outside of california grow, we continue to secure additional packing arrangements closer to such markets to further reduce freight costs. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, glass, pet/plastic bottles, cans, labels, flavors or supplement ingredients or certain sweeteners, or packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. although our production arrangements are generally of short duration or are terminable upon request, we believe a short disruption or delay would not significantly affect our revenues since alternative packing facilities in the united states with adequate capacity can usually be obtained for many of our products at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. however, there are limited packing facilities in the united states with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our newer products, including hansen brand energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, aseptic juice products, energade in 24-ounce cans, teas in 16-ounce pet/plastic bottles, monster energy , lost energy , rumba tm , joker mad energy tm , ace , unbound energy energy drinks in 8.3-, 15.5-, 16-, and 24-ounce cans and java monster coffee drinks in 16-ounce cans. a disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing facilities in the united states with adequate capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. consequently, a disruption in production of such products could affect our revenues. we continue to seek alternative and/or additional co-packing facilities in the united states or canada with adequate capacity for the production of our various products to minimize the risk of any disruption in production. 10 on april 28, 2006, hbc entered into a distribution agreement with cadbury bebidas, s.a. de c.v. ( cadbury bebidas ), for exclusive distribution by cadbury bebidas throughout mexico, excluding baja california, of our monster energy and lost energy tm energy products. on may 8, 2006, hbc entered into the monster beverages off-premise distribution coordination agreement and the allied products distribution coordination agreement (jointly, the off-premise agreements ) with anheuser-busch, inc., a missouri corporation ( ab ). under the off-premise agreements, select anheuser-busch distributors (the ab distributors ) will distribute and sell, in markets designated by hbc, hbc monster energy and lost energy tm brands non-alcoholic energy drinks, rumba brand energy juice and unbound energy brand energy drinks, as well as additional products that may be agreed between the parties. we intend to continue building our national distributor network primarily with select ab distributors as well as with our sales force throughout 2007 to support and grow the sales of our products. pursuant to the anheuser-busch distribution agreements (the ab distribution agreements ) entered into with newly appointed ab distributors, non-refundable payments totaling $20.9 million were made to the company by such newly appointed ab distributors for the costs of terminating the company prior distributors through december, 31, 2006. such receipts have been accounted for as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2006 and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated 20 year life of the respective ab distribution agreements. as of december 31, 2006, amounts totaling $3.3 million had been paid to the company by certain other ab distributors in anticipation of executing ab distribution agreements with the company. such receipts have been accounted for as customer deposit liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2006. through december 31, 2006, the company incurred termination costs amounting to $12.7 million in aggregate to certain of its prior distributors. such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2006. certain amounts totaling $7.0 million included in such termination costs were not paid to our prior distributors before the end of our fiscal year and are therefore included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2006. on february 8, 2007, hbc entered into the on-premise distribution coordination agreement (the on-premise agreement ) with ab. under the on-premise agreement, ab will manage and coordinate the sales, distribution and merchandising of monster energy energy drinks to on-premise retailers including bars, nightclubs and restaurants in territories approved by hbc. on march 1, 2007, hbc entered into a distribution agreement with pepsi-qtg canada, a division of pepsico canada, ulc ( pepsi canada ), for the exclusive distribution by pepsi canada throughout canada of our monster energy , lost energy tm , hansen and joker mad energy energy products. distribution levels vary from state to state and from product to product. certain of our products are sold in canada and mexico. we also sell a limited range of our products to distributors outside of the united states, including in the caribbean, central and south america, japan, korea, and saudi arabia. we continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products. in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. we continue to endeavor to reduce our inventory levels. 11 during 2006, we continued to expand distribution of our natural sodas and smoothies outside of california. we expanded our national sales force to support and grow sales, primarily of monster energy drinks, lost energy tm , ace tm , unbound energy , and joker mad energy tm energy drinks, rumba tm energy juice and energade energy sports drinks and we intend to continue to build such sales force in 2007. our blue sky products are sold primarily to the health food trade, natural food chains and mainstream grocery store chains, through specialty health food distributors. during 2004, we entered into exclusive contracts with the state of california ( state ) department of health services, women, infant and children ( wic ) supplemental nutrition branch ( dhs ) to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles. the contracts commenced on july 12, 2004 and were due to expire in july 2007. the parties have mutually agreed to extend the contracts until july 11, 2008. under these contracts hansen is the exclusive supplier for both apple juice and for the blended juice category, a new wic category, initially with our 100% apple grape juice. during 2005, our apple strawberry juice was approved within the blended juice category and became eligible for redemption under the wic contract in addition to our 100% apple grape juice. the wic contracts have expanded the distribution of hansen juices, resulting in increased exposure for the hansen brand. wic-approved items are stocked by the grocery trade and by wic-only stores. products are purchased by wic consumers with vouchers given by the dhs to qualified participants. our principal warehouse and distribution center and corporate offices relocated to our current facility in october 2000. in january 2004, we leased an additional warehouse facility in corona, california to consolidate additional space that had been leased by us on short term leases from time to time to meet our increased warehousing needs due to increases in both sales volumes and products and terminated two short term leases concerned. this facility was subsequently sublet on april 1, 2007. in june 2006, the company leased additional warehouse and office space in corona, california for a one-year period. in october 2006, we entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space also located in corona, california. this lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months commencing march 2007, excluding renewal options. the monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. the new warehouse and distribution space will replace our existing warehouse and distribution space located in corona, california. we plan to sublet our existing office, warehouse and distribution space for the remainder of the lease term, unless we are able to find a tenant acceptable to the landlord and the landlord agrees to the early termination of the lease. in october 2006, we also entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million, located adjacent to the newly leased warehouse and distribution space in corona, california for the purpose of constructing a new office building which will replace our existing office space in corona, california. in the interim, we have leased additional office space located near our existing corporate offices. (see part i item 2 properties ). raw materials and suppliers the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, glass bottles and pet plastic bottles as well as juices, high fructose corn syrup, sucrose and sucralose, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations. due to the consolidations that have taken place in the glass industry over the past few years, the prices of glass bottles continue to increase. the prices of pet plastic bottles and aluminum cans increased significantly in 2006 and again in 2007. the prices of high fructose corn syrup, sucrose and certain juice concentrates, including apple, increased in 2006 and certain of these ingredients continued to increase in 2007. these increased costs, together with increased costs primarily of energy, 12 gas and freight, resulted in increases in certain product costs which are ongoing and are expected to continue to exert pressure on our gross margins in 2007. we are uncertain whether the prices of these or any other raw materials or ingredients will continue to rise in the future. generally, raw materials utilized by us in our business are readily available from numerous sources. however, certain raw materials are manufactured by only one company. sucralose, which is used alone or in combination with acesulfame-k in the company low-calorie products, is purchased by us from a single manufacturer. certain of our cans are only manufactured by a single company in the united states. with regard to fruit juice and juice-drink products, the industry is subject to variability of weather conditions, which may result in higher prices and/or lower consumer demand for juices. we purchase beverage flavors, concentrates, juices, supplements, high-fructose corn syrup, cane sugar, sucrose, sucralose and other sweeteners as well as other ingredients from independent suppliers located in the united states and abroad. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. we have identified alternative suppliers of many of the supplements contained in many of our beverages. however, industry-wide shortages of certain fruits and fruit juices, and supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. we continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of our flavors and concentrates from other suppliers as well as to conclude arrangements with suppliers which would enable us to obtain access to certain concentrates or flavor formulas in certain circumstances. we have been partially successful in these endeavors. additionally, in a limited number of cases, contractual restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals and licenses may limit our ability to enter into agreements with alternative suppliers and manufacturers and/or distributors. in connection with the development of new products and flavors, independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense of product development, thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively low cost. we have historically developed and successfully introduced new products and flavors and packaging for our products and intend to continue developing and introducing additional new beverages and flavors. competition the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. we also compete for distributors who will concentrate on marketing our products over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. competitive pressures in the alternative, energy and functional beverage categories could cause our products to be unable to gain or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results. 13 over the past five years we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category. a number of companies who market and distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in larger volume packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass bottles, including sobe, snapple elements, arizona and fuse, have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products as functional or energy beverages or as having functional benefits. we believe that many of those products contain lower levels of supplements and principally deliver refreshment. in addition, many competitive products are positioned differently than our energy or functional drinks. our smoothies and tea lines are positioned more closely against those products. we compete not only for consumer acceptance, but also for maximum marketing efforts by multi-brand licensed bottlers, brokers and distributors, many of which have a principal affiliation with competing companies and brands. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as the coca-cola company, pepsico, inc., cadbury schweppes plc, red bull gmbh, kraft foods, inc., nestle beverage company, tree top and ocean spray. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores. our natural sodas compete directly with traditional soda products including those marketed by the coca-cola company, pepsico, inc. and cadbury schweppes plc, as well as with carbonated beverages marketed by smaller or primarily local companies such as jones soda co., clearly canadian beverage company, crystal geyser, j.m. smucker company and with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores. our fruit juice smoothies compete directly with kern s, jumex, jugos del valle and libby nectars, v8 smoothies, as well as with single serve juice products produced by many competitors. such competitive products are packaged in glass and pet bottles ranging from 8- to 48-ounces in size and in 11.5-ounce aluminum cans. the juice content of such competitive products ranges from 1% to 100%. our apple and other juice products compete directly with tree top, mott s, martinelli s, welch s, ocean spray, tropicana, minute maid, langers, apple and eve, seneca, northland and also with other brands of apple juice and juice blends, especially store brands. our energy drinks, including hansen energy, diet red, monster energy , lost energy , joker mad energy , ace energy, unbound energy and rumba energy juice in 8.3-, 15.5-, 16- and 24-ounce cans, compete directly with red bull, rockstar, full throttle, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, 180, extreme energy shot, red devil, rip it, nos, boo koo, and many other brands. the coca-cola company and pepsico inc. also market and/or distribute additional products in that market segment such as mountain dew, mountain dew mdx and vault. our java monster coffee drinks compete directly with starbucks frappuccino and other coffee drinks, cinnabon coffee drinks and godiva dairy based drinks. our e 2 o energy water and still water products compete directly with vitamin water, propel, dasani, aquafina, fruit 2 o, evian, crystal geyser, naya, palomar mountain, sahara, arrowhead, dannon, and other brands of flavored water and still water, especially store brands. sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events in respect of all our beverages and drink mixes. we use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events at which we distribute our products to consumers for sampling. we utilize push-pull methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand from consumers for our products including advertising, 14 in store promotions and in store placement of point of sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes such as cancer research and spca as well as of extreme sports teams such as the pro circuit kawasaki motocross and supercross teams, kawasaki factory motocross and supercross teams, alan pflueger desert racing team, kenny bernstein drag racing team, extreme sports figures and athletes, sporting events such as the monster energy pipeline pro surfing competition, marathons, 10k runs, bicycle races, volleyball tournaments and other health and sports related activities, including extreme sports, particularly supercross, freestyle motocross, surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing, snowboarding, bmx, mountain biking, snowmobile racing, and also participate in product demonstrations, food tasting and other related events. posters, print, radio and television advertising together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. additionally, in 2003 we entered into a multi-year sponsorship agreement to advertise on the new las vegas monorail ( monorail agreement ) with the las vegas monorail company ( lvmc ) which includes the right to vend our monster energy drinks and natural sodas on all stations. the initial term of the monorail agreement commenced on january 1, 2005 and has been renewed annually thereafter. we have renewed the agreement for 2007 but at a lower annual rate. we believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation such as making hansen products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. we review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. the labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. where appropriate we partner with retailers to assist our marketing efforts. for example, while we retain responsibility for the marketing of the juice slam line of children multi-vitamin juice drinks, costco has undertaken partial responsibility for the marketing of the juice blast line. we increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by approximately 50 % in 2006 compared to 2005. as of december 31, 2006, we employed 591 employees in sales and marketing activities, of which 231 were employed on a full-time basis. customers our customers are typically retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers. sales to our various customer types for 2006 are reflected below. the allocations below reflect changes made by the company to the categories historically reported. retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 12 % club stores, drug chains &amp; mass merchandisers 14 % full service distributors 69 % health food distributors 2 % other 3 % our customers include cadbury schweppes bottling group (formally known as dr. pepper bottling/7up bottling group), wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), kalil bottling group, trader joe s, john lenore &amp; company, costco, kroger, safeway and albertsons. a decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the company or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. cadbury schweppes bottling group, a customer of the dsd division, accounted for approximately 19%,18% and 15 13% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), a customer of both the dsd and warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 12% of our net sales for the year ended december 31, 2006. seasonality sales of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. the volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions. sales of our beverage products may become increasingly subject to seasonal fluctuations as more sales occur outside of california with respect to our products. however, the energy drink category appears to be less seasonal than traditional beverages. as the percentage of our sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors, including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of sales of our finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising, marketing and promotional expenses. intellectual property we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed as long as the trademarks are in use. we also own the copyright in and to numerous statements made and content appearing on the packaging of our products. we own the hansen trademark. this trademark is crucial to our business and is registered in the u.s. patent and trademark office and in various countries throughout the world. we own a number of other trademark registrations including, but not limited to, a new kind a buzz ,unleash the beast! , hansen energy , blue energy , energade , hansen e 2 o energy water , hansen slim down , power formula , the real deal , liquidfruit , california natural choice , medicine man , hansen power , b well , anti-ox , d-stress , stamina , defense , immunejuice , hansen natural multi-vitamin juice slam , juice blast , red rocker , monster energy , m (stylized) , m monster energy and hansen natural soda in the united states and, the monster , monster energy , m(stylized) , hansen and smoothie trademarks in a number of countries around the world. we have applied to register a number of trademarks in the united states and elsewhere including, but not limited to, monster , monster energy , m(stylized) , assault , energy pro , khaos , monster m-80 , predator , m monster mutant , joker mad energy , ace , rumba , fizzit and fizz bomb , java monster , mean bean , java monster big black , loca moca and the juice is loose . in september 2000, in connection with the acquisition of the blue sky natural beverage business, we acquired the blue sky trademark which is registered in the united states and canada, through our wholly owned subsidiary blue sky. in may 2001, in connection with the acquisition of the junior juice beverage business, we acquired the junior juice trademark, which is registered in the united states, through our wholly owned subsidiary junior juice. in october 2006, we acquired the unbound energy trademark which is registered in the united sates. on april 4, 2000, the united states patent and trademark office issued a patent to us for an invention related to a shelf structure (rolling rack) and, more particularly, a shelf structure for a walk-in cooler. such shelf structure is utilized by us to secure shelf space for and to merchandise our energy and functional drinks in cans in refrigerated visi coolers and walk-in coolers in retail stores. 16 government regulation the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products is subject to the federal food, drug and cosmetic act; the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. the law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. while none of our beverage products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the california list in the future. we also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. the precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the united states and elsewhere. our facilities in the united states are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. employees as of december 31, 2006, we employed a total of 748 employees of which 377 were employed on a full-time basis. of our 748 employees, we employ 157 in administrative and operational capacities and 591 persons in sales and marketing capacities. we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider relations with our employees to be good. compliance with environmental laws in california, we are required to collect redemption values from our customers and to remit such redemption values to the state of california department of conservation based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. in certain other states and canada where hansen products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective state agencies based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states. 17 available information our internet address is www.hansens.com. information contained on our website is not part of this annual report on form 10-k. our annual report on form 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q will be made available free of charge on www.hansens.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the sec. in addition, you may request a copy of these filings (excluding exhibits) at no cost by writing or telephoning us at the following address or telephone number: hansen beverage company 1010 railroad street corona, ca 92882 (951) 739-6200 (800) hansens (800) 426-7367 18 item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a. if we fail to do so, our business, results of operations or financial condition and the value of our stock could be materially harmed. part ii, item 9a reports our changes in internal control over financial reporting relating to the documentation of stock option grants. we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful and we may face additional risks of errors or delays in preparing our consolidated financial statements and associated risks of potential late filings of periodic reports and increased expenses arising from such matters. legal proceedings related to our historical stock option grant practices and other issues may significantly harm our business. several lawsuits have been filed against us and current officers and members of the board of directors in connection with our prior stock option practices. these lawsuits are described more fully in part i, item 3. legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. defending these lawsuits will result in significant expenditures and the continued diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. from time to time, we may become involved in other litigation or other proceedings. matters arising out of or related to our review of historic stock option granting practices, including the outcome of the informal inquiry commenced by the sec, any other proceedings which may be brought against us by the sec or other governmental agencies, the outcome of our delisting proceedings and the outcome of litigation could possibly harm our future results of operations or financial condition due to expenses we may incur to defend ourselves or the ramifications of an adverse decision. increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as the coca-cola company, pepsico inc., cadbury schweppes plc, red bull gmbh, kraft foods inc., nestle beverage company, tree top and ocean spray. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. our products also compete with private label brands such as 19 those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results. a substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our monster energy brand energy drinks. our dsd segment which comprises primarily energy drinks, represented 85% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2006. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category. our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, full throttle, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, 180, extreme energy shot, red devil, rip it, nos, boo koo and many other brands. a number of companies who market and distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in different packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass bottles, including sobe, snapple elements, arizona, fuse, and vitamin water, have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products as functional or energy beverages or as having functional benefits. in addition, certain large companies such as the coca-cola company and pepsico inc. market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as mountain dew, mountain dew mdx, and vault. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues or we could experience price erosion or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results. change in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. there is increasing awareness and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could affect our profitability. consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. additionally, many of our products are considered premium products and to maintain market share during recessionary periods we may have to reduce profit margins which would adversely affect our results of operations. product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we also may be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. we do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. although our production arrangements are generally of short duration or are terminable upon request, in the event of a disruption or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited packing facilities in the united states with adequate capacity 20 and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including hansen brand energy drinks in 8.3-ounce and 16-ounce cans, our pet tea line, aseptic juice products, juices in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles, energade , monster energy , lost energy , ace , unbound energy , rumba tm and joker mad energy tm energy drinks in 8.3-, 15.5-, 16-, and 24-ounce cans, java monster tm coffee drinks in 16-ounce cans and other products. there are also limited shrink sleeve labeling facilities available to us in the united states with adequate capacity for our e 2 o energy water . a disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing facilities in the united states with adequate capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. consequently, a disruption in production of such products could adversely affect our revenues. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our dsd products. if we are unable to secure such bottlers and distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. we continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including energy drinks. in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our dsd brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market and promote our products above the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our customers are material to our success. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, and/or convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of the our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. two customers accounted for approximately 19% and 12% of the company net sales for the year ended december 31, 2006, respectively. one customer accounted for approximately 18% and 13% of the company net sales for the years ended december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. a decision by either customer, or any other large customer, to decrease the amount purchased from the company or to cease carrying the company products could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and consolidated results of operations. we have exclusive contracts with the state of california ( state ) department of health services, women, infant and children ( wic ) supplemental nutrition branch ( dhs ) to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice, in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles. the contracts are each for a period of three years with a further one-year extension option to be mutually agreed between hansen and the state of california. the parties have mutually agreed to extend the contracts until july 11, 2008. there is no certainty whether we will be successful in securing any new future wic contracts with the state. if we are unsuccessful in securing new future wic contracts with the state, our revenues from those products could be materially adversely affected. increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us comprise aluminum cans, glass bottles and pet plastic bottles as well as juices, high fructose corn syrup, sucrose and sucralose, the costs of which are subject to 21 fluctuations. due to the consolidations that have taken place in the glass industry over the past few years, the prices of glass bottles continue to increase. the prices of pet plastic bottles and aluminum cans increased in 2006 and again in 2007. the prices of high fructose corn syrup, sucrose and certain juice concentrates, including apple, increased in 2006 and certain of these ingredients continued to increase in early 2007. these increased costs, together with increased costs primarily of energy and gas and freight resulted in increases in certain product costs which are ongoing and are expected to continue to exert pressure on our gross margins in 2007. in addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients will continue to rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. in addition, some of these raw materials, such as a sucralose and certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. sucralose, which is used in many of the company products including the company low-calorie products, is purchased by us from a single manufacturer. while we believe that our 2007 sucralose volume allocation will be sufficient to meet the demand for our products that contain sucralose, we may need to reformulate certain of those products that contain sucralose with alternative sweetener systems to avoid an interruption in supply of those products, should the need arise. we may not correctly estimate demand for our products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, pet plastic bottles, cans, glass, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain sweeteners, or packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. we do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. the majority of our packaging supplies contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as resin for pet bottles, aluminum for cans, pulp for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. accordingly, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. if we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. if we have to replace a flavor supplier, we could experience temporary disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 22 our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in and to portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such property with registered and common law trademarks and copyrights, restrictions on disclosure and other actions to prevent infringement. product packages, mechanical designs and artwork are important to our success and we take action to protect against imitation of our packaging and trade dress and to protect our trademarks and copyrights as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. significant changes in government regulation may hinder sales. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products is subject to the federal food, drug and cosmetic act; the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. new statutes and regulations may also be instituted in the future. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or packaging changed, thus adversely affecting our financial condition and operations. california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. while none of our beverage products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the california list in the future. we also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. if we are unable to maintain brand image or product quality, or if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to maintain and build brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. we have no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preferences. product quality issues, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if fake or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches. product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. while we have to date not experienced any credible product liability litigation, there is no assurance that we will not experience such litigation in the future. in the event we were to experience product liability claims or a product recall, our financial condition and business operations could be materially adversely effected. if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, or if our retailer inventory levels are too high, our operating results will be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels will not be appropriate and our results of operations 23 may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance for any members of our senior management. we currently have employment agreements with mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg which end on december 31, 2008. the loss of services of either of these persons or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. weather could adversely affect our supply chain and demand for our products. with regard to fruit juice, fruit juice concentrates and natural flavors, the beverage industry is subject to variability of weather conditions, which may result in higher prices and/or the nonavailability of any of such items. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate, particularly in areas outside of california. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other persons and many other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we may be unable to achieve analysts earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others. there can be no assurance that the company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, on may 16, 2007, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to control a maximum of 21.8% of our outstanding common stock. consequently, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg could exercise significant control on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and approving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. 24 our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, which could adversely affect our financial results. - qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks ). review of historic stock option granting practices on october 26, 2006, we received a letter from the staff of the pacific regional office of the sec requesting that we voluntarily produce certain documents and information relating to the filing of sec forms 4 and our stock option granting practices from january 1, 1996 to the present. the sec subsequently agreed, in the absence of any further requests, to limit the voluntary production of certain documents and information from january 1, 2001 to the present. we have cooperated with the sec and believe that we have completed our production of the documents and information requested in the october 26, 2006 letter. in november 2006, we appointed a special committee of the board of directors (the special committee ) to undertake an independent investigation relating to our stock option grants and our stock option granting practices. the special committee retained independent counsel and accounting advisors to assist in conducting the investigation. the special committee reviewed all stock option grants from january 1, 2001 through november 13, 2006. in the course of its investigation, the special committee reviewed over one million documents and emails and extensively interviewed numerous officers and directors, as well as certain other personnel. the special committee has completed its independent investigation and found no willful or intentional misconduct in connection with the granting or dating of, or accounting for, stock options. the special committee also found that the late filing of certain form 4 reports, as identified in a report issued 32 last year by glass lewis &amp; co., did not indicate that option grants had been backdated. the special committee found no evidence raising concerns with the integrity of management and found that management and other company personnel interviewed in the course of the investigation were cooperative and credible. based on the special committee review of all stock option grants and our evaluation of applicable accounting rules, management concluded that the terms with respect to 10 new hire grants and two merit grants, had not been determined with finality as at the grant date, resulting in a decision to change the measurement dates for such grants. additionally, seven grants were identified where the stock option agreements mistakenly reflected the exercise price at either the closing price of our common stock on the date prior to the grant date or the opening price of our common stock on the grant date instead of the closing price on the grant date, resulting in minor pricing errors. the pre-tax compensation expense resulting from the above-described accounting errors is approximately $0.1 million, which should have been recorded within operating expenses over the period from january 1, 2001 through the second quarter ended june 30, 2006. additionally, we identified one grant where there was an error in the application of apb no. 25 related to a grant modification given to a non-executive employee in fiscal 2001 and a separate error in the application of sfas no. 123(r), related to the cancellation of a grant to a non-executive employee in 2006. the pre-tax compensation adjustment for these two grants is approximately $1.0 million which should have been recorded within operating expenses over the period january 1, 2001 through june 30, 2006. as a result of the issues discussed above regarding our past stock option practices, certain of our option grants that were previously characterized as incentive stock options in accordance with internal revenue code section 422 ( iso ) will be considered to be non-qualified stock options. the unintentional accounting errors arising from the items discussed above caused non-cash compensation expense together with related employment tax expenses to be understated by a cumulative amount of $1.3 million ($1.0 million net of income tax) over the period january 1, 2001 through june 30, 2006. we have concluded that the impact of these errors is not material to our historical consolidated financial statements for any previously reported period. a correcting entry to record the cumulative impact of these errors was recorded during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2006. the company also does not consider the adjustment to be material to the fiscal year ended december 31, 2006. the adjustments increased other operating expenses by $1.3 million and reduced provision for income taxes by $0.3 million, which resulted in a $1.0 million reduction in net income. the adjustment also had the effect of increasing non-current deferred tax assets by $0.05 million and reducing additional paid-in capital by $0.2 million at december 31, 2006. the special committee also found that during the time period covered by its review, internal accounting controls relating to our stock option granting process were inadequate, specifically control deficiencies related to the process of documenting the approval of stock option grants and the financial accounting in connection with certain option grants. in the summer of 2006, our internal audit department performed an analysis of certain aspects of our process for granting stock options. during that time, management implemented improvements relating to the documentation of stock option grants. these improvements included contemporaneous documentation of the approval of stock option grants and contemporaneous preparation of stock option agreements for the grants approved. such practices were implemented during the quarter ended september 30, 2006. additionally, beginning the second quarter of 2006, the accounting department implemented new procedures to review and verify the accuracy of grant prices. during the fourth quarter of 2006, the company also implemented additional procedures for the communication and recording of modifications and cancellations of stock option grants. 33 effective january 1, 2007, we implemented new written procedures regarding the granting of stock options. under these new procedures, the compensation committee of the board of directors ( compensation committee ) has sole and exclusive authority to grant stock option awards to all employees who are not new hires and to all new hires who are subject to section 16 of the exchange act. the compensation committee and the executive committee of the board of directors ( executive committee ) each independently has the authority to grant awards to new hires who are not section 16 employees. awards granted by the executive committee are not subject to approval or ratification by the board or the compensation committee. for purposes of these procedures, a new hire means: (i) an employee who is commencing employment with the company or its subsidiaries; or (ii) an employee who is receiving a promotion to a new position with the company or one of its subsidiaries. the grant date of any award to a new hire shall be the first day that the nasdaq stock market ( nasdaq ) is open in the calendar month following the employee commencement of employment or the date of the employee promotion (as the case may be). other than awards to new hires, awards may only be granted at a single meeting held during the last two weeks of may and november of each year. the grant date of any award granted at a may or november meeting shall be the first day that nasdaq is open in june following such may meeting, or december following such november meeting (as the case may be). the new procedures also require certain same day documentation. the special committee found that the above described procedures constitute best practices. the compensation committee will review and approve stock option awards to our named executive officers ( neos ) based upon a review of competitive compensation data, its assessment of individual performance, a review of each executive long term incentives and retention considerations. nasdaq proceedings on november 15, 2006, we received a nasdaq staff determination letter from nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2006, we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing under nasdaq marketplace rule 4310(c)(14), and that our securities are, therefore, subject to delisting from the nasdaq capital market. we made a request for a hearing before the nasdaq listing qualifications panel (the panel ). on january 4, 2007, we notified nasdaq of our inadvertent issuance of an out-of-plan stock option to purchase 12,000 shares of our common stock (pre stock splits) to an outside director on november 5, 2004, approximately four months after the period for granting options under the company stock option plan for outside directors (the 1994 plan ) had expired, in apparent violation of nasdaq marketplace rule 4350(i)(1)(a). on january 10, 2007, we received another nasdaq staff determination letter stating that because we had not yet regained compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule 4350(i)(1)(a), such violation served as an additional basis for delisting the company securities from the nasdaq capital market. the panel hearing was held on january 25, 2007. the panel granted our request for continued listing of our securities on the nasdaq stock market. our continued listing is subject to certain conditions, including: (1) on or about march 26, 2007, we were required to submit to nasdaq a copy of our final investigatory report or were required to respond to nasdaq questions regarding the special committee investigation of option grants; (2) on or before may 1, 2007, we were required to inform the panel that we had obtained stockholder approval for the granting of the out-of-plan option grant, or had unwound the option grant; and (3) on or before may 14, 2007, we were required to file our form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2006. on march 5, 2007, we received an additional nasdaq staff determination letter from nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2006, we are not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing under nasdaq marketplace rule 4310(c)(14), and that this filing delinquency serves as an additional basis for delisting us from nasdaq. on may 16, 2007, we received an additional nasdaq staff determination letter from nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our form 10-q for the quarter ended march 31, 2007, we are not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing under nasdaq marketplace rule 4310(c)(14), and that this filing delinquency serves as an additional basis for delisting us from nasdaq. 34 we have met conditions (1), (2) and (3) of the panel decision relating to our request for continued listing of our securities on the nasdaq capital market. we are still required to file our form 10-q for the three-months ended march 31, 2007 to achieve compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing under nasdaq marketplace rule 4310(c)(14). by filing this form 10-k, the company has complied with the panel deadline of june 14, 2007 for the filing of the form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2006. the company anticipates filing the form 10-q for the three-months ended march 31, 2007 as soon as practicable and within the time period required by nasdaq to continue to be listed on the nasdaq capital market. as a result of the late filing of the 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2006, the form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2006, and the 10-q for the three-months ended march 31, 2007 we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s-3 for sale by us or resale by others for one year. the inability to use form s-3 could adversely affect our ability to raise capital during this period. however, we are still eligible to register our securities on form s-1. if we fail to timely file a future periodic report with the sec and our stock were delisted, it could severely impact our ability to raise future capital and could have an adverse impact on our overall future liquidity. the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. our business overview we develop, market, sell and distribute alternative beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and functional drinks, non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, children multi-vitamin juice drinks, junior juice juices and non-carbonated lightly flavored energy waters under the hansen brand name. we also develop, market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the following brand names; monster energy , lost energy , joker mad energy , unbound energy and ace brand names as well as rumba brand energy juice. we also market, sell and distribute java monster non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks. we also market, sell and distribute natural sodas, premium natural sodas with supplements, organic natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy drinks under the blue sky brand name. our fruit juices for toddlers are marketed under the junior juice brand name. we also market, sell and distribute vitamin and mineral drink mixes in powdered form under the fizzit brand name. we have two reportable segments, namely dsd, whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. the dsd segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages and drink mixes is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events. we use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we sample our products to consumers. we utilize push-pull methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand from consumers for our products, including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes such as cancer research and spcas, as well as extreme sports teams such as the pro circuit kawasaki motocross and supercross teams, kawasaki factory motocross and supercross 35 teams, alan pflueger desert racing team, kenny bernstein drag racing team, extreme sports figures and athletes, sporting events such as the monster energy pro pipeline surfing competition, winter and summer x-games, marathons, 10k runs, bicycle races, volleyball tournaments and other health and sports related activities, including extreme sports, particularly supercross, freestyle motocross, surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing, snowboarding, bmx, mountain biking, snowmobile racing, etc., and we also participate in product demonstrations, food tasting and other related events. posters, print, radio and television advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. we believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, such as making hansen products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. we review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. the labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. during 2006, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. in particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the alternative beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. during the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the monster beverages off-premise distribution coordination agreement and the allied products distribution coordination agreement (jointly, the off-premise agreements ) with anheuser-busch, inc., a missouri corporation ( ab ). under the off-premise agreements, select anheuser-busch distributors (the ab distributors ) will distribute and sell, in markets designated by hbc, hbc monster energy and lost energy tm brands non-alcoholic energy drinks, rumba brand energy juice and unbound energy brand energy drinks, as well as additional products that may be agreed between the parties. we intend to continue building our national distributor network primarily with select ab distributors as well as with our sales force throughout 2007 to support and grow the sales of our products. pursuant to the anheuser-busch distribution agreements (the ab distribution agreements ) entered into with newly appointed ab distributors, non-refundable payments totaling $20.9 million were made to the company by such newly appointed ab distributors for the costs of terminating the company prior distributors through december 31, 2006. such receipts have been accounted for as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2006 and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated 20 year life of the respective ab distribution agreements. as of december 31, 2006, amounts totaling $3.3 million had been paid to the company by certain other ab distributors in anticipation of executing ab distribution agreements with the company. such receipts have been accounted for as customer deposit liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2006. through december 31, 2006, the company incurred termination costs amounting to $12.7 million in aggregate to certain of its prior distributors. such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2006. certain amounts totaling $7.0 million included in such termination costs were not paid to our prior distributors before our fiscal year end and are therefore included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2006. on april 28, 2006, hbc entered into a distribution agreement with cadbury bebidas, s.a. de c.v. ( cadbury bebidas ), for exclusive distribution by cadbury bebidas throughout mexico, excluding baja california, of our monster energy and lost energy energy products. 36 on february 8, 2007, hbc entered into the on-premise distribution coordination agreement (the on-premise agreement ) with ab. under the on-premise agreement, ab will manage and coordinate the sales, distribution and merchandising of monster energy energy drinks to on-premise retailers including bars, nightclubs and restaurants in territories approved by hbc. on march 1, 2007, hbc entered into a distribution agreement with pepsi-qtg canada, a division of pepsico canada, ulc ( pepsi canada ), for the exclusive distribution by pepsi canada throughout canada of our monster energy , lost energy , hansen and joker mad energy energy products. we again achieved record gross sales in 2006. the increase in gross sales in 2006 was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of certain of our existing products as well as certain new products, particularly monster energy khaos tm energy drinks, ace tm energy drinks and unbound energy drinks. the percentage increase in gross sales was lower than the percentage increase in net sales, primarily due to a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, which decreased from 16.0% to 13.0%. the actual amount of promotional and other allowances increased to $90.5 million from $66.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2006 and december 31, 2005, respectively. a substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our monster energy brand energy drinks. any decrease in sales of our monster energy brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results. (see part i, item 1a. - risk factors ) during the year ended december 31, 2006, gross sales shipped outside of california represented 67.8% of our gross sales, as compared to 61.5% for the comparable period in 2005. during the year ended december 31, 2006, gross sales to distributors outside the united states amounted to $19.3 million, as compared to $5.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. such sales were approximately 2.8% of gross sales for the year ended december 31, 2006 and approximately 1.3% of gross sales for the comparable period in 2005. our customers are typically retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers. gross sales to our various customer types for 2006 are reflected below. the allocations below reflect changes made by the company to the categories historically reported. 2006 2005 2004 retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 12 % 19 % 25 % club stores, drug chains &amp; mass merchandisers 14 % 11 % 13 % full service distributors 69 % 65 % 52 % health food distributors 2 % 3 % 6 % other 3 % 2 % 4 % our customers include cadbury schweppes bottling group (formally known as dr. pepper bottling/7up bottling group), wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), kalil bottling group, trader joe s, john lenore &amp; company, costco, kroger, safeway and albertsons. a decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the company or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. cadbury schweppes bottling group, a customer of the dsd division, accounted for approximately 19%, 18% and 13% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), a customer of both the dsd and warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 12% of the company net sales for the year ended december 31, 2006. 37 in september 2000, hbc, through its wholly owned subsidiary blue sky, acquired the blue sky natural soda business. the blue sky natural soda brand is the leading natural soda in the health food trade. blue sky offers natural sodas, premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as ginseng and anti-oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12-ounce cans and a blue sky blue energy drink in 8.3-ounce cans and in 2004 introduced a new line of blue sky natural tea sodas in 12-ounce cans. in 2005, we introduced a new line of blue sky lite natural sodas, a new line of blue sky natural sodas made with real sugar and a new line of non-carbonated blue sky isotonic sports drinks. in 2006, we introduced our blue sky blue energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and introduced a new blue sky juice based energy drink in both 8-ounce and 16-ounce cans. in may 2001, hbc, through its wholly owned subsidiary junior juice, acquired the junior juice beverage business. the junior juice product line is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23-ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. in october 2006, we acquired the unbound energy trademark and assumed the production, marketing and sale of unbound energy energy drinks in 16-ounce cans. we subsequently introduced a lo-carb and juice version in 16-ounce cans. during 2004, we concluded exclusive contracts with the state of california, department of health services women, infant and children supplemental nutrition branch, to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles. the contracts commenced on july 12, 2004 and will expire in july 2008. (see part i, item 1. business manufacture and distribution ). we continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. value drivers of our business we believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: profitable growth we believe natural, better for you brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. we continue to broaden our family of brands. in particular, we are expanding and growing our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. we are focused on maintaining or increasing profit margins. we believe that tailored brand, package, price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. we are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. cost management the principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction. one key area of focus, for example, is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. another key area of focus is the reduction in inventory levels. however, due to the expansion in the number of our products, increased sales levels in 2006, and the conclusion of the agreements with ab, overall inventory levels increased. during 2006, the costs of pet plastic bottles and aluminum cans, as well as the costs of high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, certain juice concentrates, including apple, and certain packaging and freight costs also increased. efficient capital structure our capital structure is intended to optimize our costs of capital. we believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost and overall low costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. 38 we believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in (1) maintaining and/or improving our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. the ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. in 2006, gross sales totaled $696.3 million, a 67.6% increase over 2005. net sales totaled $605.8 million in 2006, an increase of 73.6% over 2005. gross profit totaled $316.6 million in 2006, a 73.4% increase from 2005. operating income was $158.6 million compared to $103.4 million for 2005. net income was $97.9 million as compared to $62.8 million for 2005. net income per diluted share was $0.99 as compared to net income per diluted share of $0.65 in 2005. these measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2007 and beyond. see also results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2006 compared to the year ended december 31, 2005. in 2006, the company had working capital of $212.3 million compared to $107.3 million as of december 31, 2005. in 2006, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $76.4 million as compared to $54.6 million in 2005. principal uses of cash flows are purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and trademarks. payment of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. (see also part ii, item 7. - liquidity and capital resources ). opportunities, challenges and risks looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our company. increase in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. we recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. we continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences. in addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our company future financial results include, but are not limited to: maintenance of our brand images and product quality; profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (see also part i, item 1. - - business - competition and sales and marketing ); restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; 39 protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; limitations on available quantities of sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener that is used in many of our beverage products, due to demand for such sweetener exceeding the supplier production capacity, as well as limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap can and copacking availability; the imposition of additional restrictions; and (see also part i, item 1a. - risk factors ) for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company. we believe that the following opportunities exist for us: growth potential for non-alcoholic beverage categories including energy drinks, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water; new product introductions intended to contribute to higher gross profits; premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; proper positioning to capture industry growth; and broadening distribution/expansion opportunities 40 results of operations percentage change 2006

performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with gaap, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. however, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. the use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. ** although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with gaap and meet gaap requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with gaap presentation requirements. additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. the presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. 41 results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2006 compared to the year ended december 31, 2005 segment reclassification. rumba tm brand energy juice, which was previously reported in the warehouse segment, is now reported in the dsd segment. similarly, hansen energy drinks, which were previously reported in the dsd segment, are now reported in the warehouse segment. for presentation purposes, these changes are assumed to have commenced january 1, 2006 and are reflected as such in the figures for the year ended december 31, 2006. the comparable figures for such products for the years ended december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as previously reported, have been recast to reflect the above reclassification. gross sales.* gross sales were $696.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $280.9 million or 67.6% higher than the $415.4 million gross sales for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in gross sales for 2006 was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes of certain of our existing products, including the full year sales of monster energy khaos tm energy drinks which were introduced in august 2005. promotional and other allowances were $90.5 million for 2006 an increase of 24.0 million or 36.1% higher than promotional and other allowances of $66.5 million for 2005. promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased from 16.0% in 2005 to 13.0% in 2006. as a result the percentage increase in gross sales in 2006 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *gross sales see definition above. net sales . net sales were $605.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $256.9 million or 73.6% higher than net sales of $348.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our monster energy brand energy drinks, which include monster energy drinks (introduced in april 2002), lo-carb monster energy drinks (introduced in 2003), monster energy assault tm energy drinks (introduced in september 2004), as well as sales of monster energy khaos tm energy drinks (introduced in august 2005). to a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, lost energy drinks (introduced in january 2004), sports drinks, rumba brand energy juice (introduced december 2004), junior juice , ace energy drinks (introduced in august 2006) and unbound energy energy drinks. the increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of hansen energy drinks, smoothies in cans and energade energy sports drinks. case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents were 72.7 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of 24.5 million cases or 50.9% higher than case sales of 48.2 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2005. the overall average net sales price per case increased to $8.33 for 2006 or 15% higher than the net sales price per case of $7.24 for 2005. the increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. net sales for the dsd segment were $514.3 million for year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $251.4 million or 95.6% higher than net sales of $262.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our monster energy brand energy drinks, which include monster energy drinks, lo-carb monster energy drinks, monster energy assault tm energy drinks, as well as sales of monster energy khaos tm energy drinks. to a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of lost energy drinks, rumba tm brand energy juice, ace tm energy drinks and unbound energy energy drinks. the increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of energade energy sports drinks. net sales for the warehouse segment were $91.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $5.5 million or 6.4% higher than net sales of $86.0 million for the year 42 ended december 31, 2005. the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, junior juice and sports drinks. the increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of hansen energy drinks and smoothies in cans. gross profit.*** gross profit was $316.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $134.1 million or 73.4% higher than the gross profit of $182.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.3% for both 2006 and 2005. increases in sales volumes contributed to an increase in gross profit dollars. gross profit as a percentage of net sales was affected by an increase in the percentage of sales within the dsd segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. in addition, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also affected by a significant increase in certain freight-in costs due to the addition of new co-packers and warehouses and an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including sucrose, pet and aluminum cans and apple juice concentrate. these factors were offset by increased sales of dsd segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the warehouse segment. ***gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. operating expenses . total operating expenses were $158.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9 million or 99.8% higher than total operating expenses of $79.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 26.1% for 2006 from 22.6% for 2005. the increase in total operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased selling and distribution, and general and administrative expenses. selling and distribution expenses were $95.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $44.5 million or 87.8% higher than selling and distribution expenses of $50.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006 were 15.7%, which was higher than selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales of 14.6% for 2005. the increase in selling and distribution expenses was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $18.9 million primarily due to increased volumes of shipments and increased freight rates and fuel prices, as well as increased expenditures of $6.9 million for merchandise displays primarily in anticipation of the changeover to select ab distributors, $4.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements, $4.3 million for trade development activities with distributors and customers, $2.7 million for commissions and royalties , and $1.8 million for sampling programs. general and administrative expenses were $62.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $34.4 million or 121.6% higher than general and administrative expenses of

percentage of net sales of 8.1% for 2005. the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors of $12.7 million, stock compensation expense of $8.3 million as a result of our adoption of sfas 123r which was not expensed in the previous year (see part ii, item 8, note 12, stock-based compensation ) including a cumulative adjustment of $1.3 million relating to stock based compensation and related charges (see part ii, item 8, note 13, review of historic stock option granting practices ), an increase in payroll expenses of $5.3 million, and an increase of $5.2 million in professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees. included in legal and accounting fees are costs of $3.8 million relating to the company special investigation of stock option grants. contribution margin. contribution margin represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can be directly attributed to segment net sales. contribution margin for the 43 dsd segment was $187.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9 million or 72.4% higher than contribution margin of $109.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in contribution margin for the dsd segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of monster energy brand energy drinks. contribution margin for the warehouse segment was $6.1 million for 2006, a decrease of approximately $4.3 million or 41.0% lower than contribution margin of $10.4 million for 2005. the decrease in the contribution margin for the warehouse segment was primarily attributable to reduced sales of hansen energy drinks and a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw materials and production. operating income. operating income was $158.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $55.2 million or 53.4% higher than operating income of $103.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in operating income was attributable to higher gross profit, which was offset by increased selling, distribution, general and administrative expenses. operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.2% for 2006 from 29.6% for 2005. the decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. interest income, net . net interest income was $3.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of $2.3 million from net interest income of $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on the company invested cash balances which have increased significantly over the year. provision for income taxes . provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2006 was $64.3 million as compared to provision for income taxes of $42.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the effective combined federal and state tax rate for was 39.6%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 40.1% for 2005. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that are exempt from federal income taxes and, certain federal tax credits relating to export sales, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in state taxes due to the apportionment of sales to various states outside of california which have lower state tax rates. this decrease was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive stock options for which we received no tax benefit. net income . net income was $97.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of $35.1 million or 56.0% higher than net income of $62.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in net income was attributable to the increase in gross profit of approximately $134.1 million and the increase in net interest income of approximately $2.3 million, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of approximately $22.3 million. results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2005 compared to the year ended december 31, 2004 segment reclassification . rumba tm brand energy juice, which was previously reported in the warehouse segment, is now reported in the dsd segment. similarly, hansen energy drinks, which were previously reported in the dsd segment, are now reported in the warehouse segment. for presentation purposes, these changes are assumed to have commenced january 1, 2006 and are reflected as such in the figures for the year ended december 31, 2006. the comparable figures for such products for the years ended december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as previously reported, have been restated to reflect the above reclassification. gross sales. for the year ended december 31, 2005, gross sales were $415.4 million, an increase of $191.3 million or 85.4% higher than gross sales of $224.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products and the introduction of new products as discussed below in net sales. the percentage increase in gross sales was lower than the percentage increase in net sales due to a decrease in 44 the promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, which decreased from 19.5% for the year ended december 31, 2004 to 16.0% for the year ended december 31, 2005, although the actual amount of promotional and other allowances increased from $43.8 million to $66.5 million for the respective periods. *gross sales see definition above net sales. for the year ended december 31, 2005, net sales were $ 348.9 million, an increase of $168.5 million or 93.5% higher than net sales of $180.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. we again achieved record sales in 2005. the increase in gross and net sales in 2005 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our monster energy drinks, which were introduced in april 2002, including our lo-carb monster energy drinks, which were introduced in 2003, our monster energy assault tm energy drinks, which were introduced in september 2004, sales of monster energy khaos tm energy drinks, which were introduced in august 2005, increased sales by volume of lost energy tm energy drinks which were introduced in january 2004, and to a lesser extent, to sales of joker mad energy tm drinks which were introduced in january 2005, as well as increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, and children multi-vitamin juice drinks and rumba which was introduced in december 2004. the increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of hansen natural sodas , hansen energy drinks, energade and smoothies in cans. net sales case volumes (calculated on 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage equivalent basis) increased from 29.8 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2004 to 48.2 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of 18.4 million cases or 62.0%. the overall average net sales price per case also increased to $7.24 per case for the year ended december 31, 2005 from $6.06 for the year ended december 31, 2004, an increase of 19.5%. the increase in the average net sales prices per case was due to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products as described below. net sales for the dsd segment were $262.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $163.5 million or 164.4% higher than net sales of $99.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in net sales for the dsd segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our monster energy drinks, including our lo-carb monster energy drinks, our monster energy assault tm energy drinks, sales of monster energy khaos tm energy drinks, increased sales by volume of lost energy tm energy drinks. the increase in net sales was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to sales of joker mad energy tm drinks and rumba tm energy juice. the increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of energade . net sales for the warehouse segment were $86.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $5.1 million or 6.3% higher than net sales of $80.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in net sales for the warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of hansen apple juice and juice blends, children multi-vitamin juice drinks. the increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of smoothies in cans, hansen energy drinks and hansen natural sodas . gross profit . gross profit was $182.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of $99.1 million or 118.7% over the $83.5 million gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2004. gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.3% for the year ended december 31, 2005 which was higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 46.3% for the year ended december 31, 2004, due primarily to higher gross profit margins achieved on the increased sales of monster energy and lost energy tm energy drinks. although a greater percentage of our sales comprised products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit margins was partially reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products. *** gross profit see definition above 45 total operating expenses. total operating expenses were $79.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of $29.5 million or 59.6% over total operating expenses of $49.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 22.6% for the year ended december 31, 2005, from 27.4% for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. the decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the comparatively lower increase in selling, general and administrative expenses than the increase in net sales. distribution expenses, which include out-bound freight and warehousing expenses after manufacture, were $22.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2005 and $12.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2004 and have been included in operating expenses. selling . selling expenses were $50.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of $21.5 million or 73.7% over selling expenses of $29.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 14.6% for the year ended december 31, 2005 from 16.2% for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses which increased by $9.7 million, increased expenditures for trade development activities and cooperative arrangements with our customers and distributors, which increased by $4.2 million, increased expenditures for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials, and premiums, which increased by $3.0 million, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements which increased $1.7 million, increased expenditures for advertising which increased by $1.3 million, and increased expenditures for samples, which increased by $1.2 million. general and administrative. general and administrative expenses were $28.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of $8.0 million or 39.4% over general and administrative expenses of $20.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 8.1% for the year ended december 31, 2005 from 11.3% for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to payroll expenses which increased by $3.6 million, distributor termination payments which increased by $1.2 million and travel and entertainment expenses which increased by $0.7 million. amortization of trademarks . amortization of trademarks was $0.07 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, a decrease of $0.003 million from amortization of trademarks of $0.073 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the decrease in amortization of trademarks was due to a reduction in the balance of definite life trademarks. contribution margin. contribution margin represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can be directly attributed to segment net sales. contribution margin for the dsd segment was $109.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $73.9 million or 210.5% higher than contribution margin of $35.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in contribution margin for the dsd segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of monster energy brand energy drinks and lost energy tm energy drinks. contribution margin for the warehouse segment was $10.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $0.8 million or 8.3% higher than contribution margin of $9.6 million for year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in the contribution margin for the warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales of apple juice and juice blends which was offset by the reduced contribution from lower sales of hansen energy drinks. operating income. operating income was $103.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, compared to $33.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the $69.6 million increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profits, which was partially offset by increased operating expenses. 46 interest income, net . net interest income was $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, as compared to net interest income of $52,000 for the year ended december 31, 2004. net interest income consists of interest income and interest and financing expense. the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the cash balances in interest bearing accounts during the year ended december 31, 2005. interest income for the year ended december 31, 2005 was $1.4 million compared to interest income of $0.09 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. interest and financing expense for the year ended december 31, 2005 was $0.08 million compared to $0.04 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to an increase in capital leases entered into during 2005. provision for income taxes. provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2005 was $42.0 million which was an increase of $28.4 million as compared to the provision for income taxes of $13.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income. the effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2005 was 40.1%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 39.9% for 2004. net income. net income was $62.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, which was an increase of $42.4 million as compared to net income of $20.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in net income was primarily attributable to the $99.1 million increase in gross profit and an increase of net interest income of $1.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2005 which was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $29.5 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $28.4 million. liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $76.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, as compared to $54.6 million in the comparable period in 2005. for 2006, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $97.9 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $8.3 million of share-based compensation and $1.5 million of depreciation and other amortization. in 2006, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $20.4 million increase in deferred revenue, a $14.0 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $7.7 million increase in accounts payable, a $21.1 million increase in income taxes payable, a $1.0 million increase in accrued compensation and a $3.3 million increase in customer deposit liabilities. in 2006, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $45.6 million increase in inventories, a $25.9 million increase in accounts receivable, a $17.3 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options and a $10.9 million increase in deferred income taxes. the increase in accounts receivable was attributable to increased sales volumes as well as to increased sales to certain classes of customers who have longer payment terms. the increase in inventory is attributable to the addition of new copackers and warehouses, the introduction of new products and planned inventory levels to meet consumer demand. purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $95.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, as compared to $3.2 million provided by investing activities in the comparable period in 2005. for 2006, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short-term investments, particularly available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments. cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments. for both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support the marketing and promotional activities of the company, production equipment, computer and office furniture and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as wells as certain leasehold improvements. management expects that it will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess 47 of its requirements for operations, for purchasing short-term investments and for other corporate purposes. management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of the company brands. cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $7.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $0.1 million for the comparable period in 2005. for 2006, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of $27.7 million of the company common stock and principal payments of long-term debt of $1.2 million in relation to lease payments made on vehicle leases entered into over the past year. in 2006, cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a $17.3 million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and by proceeds of $3.9 million received from the issuance of common stock. debt and other obligations hbc has a credit facility from comerica bank ( comerica ) consisting of a revolving line of credit which was amended in may 2007. in accordance with the amended provisions of the credit facility, hbc increased its available borrowing under the revolving line of credit from $7.5 million collateralized to $10.0 million non-collateralized. the revolving line of credit remains in full force and effect through june 1, 2008. interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on comerica base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying libor rates up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by hbc. the company had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at december 31, 2006. the terms of the company line of credit contain certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. the company was in compliance with its covenants at december 31, 2006. if any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations under our agreement with the las vegas monorail company and other commitments. (see also part ii, item 8 - note 10, commitments &amp; contingencies ). purchase commitments include obligations made by the company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. these obligations vary in terms. the following represents a summary of the company contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of december 31, 2006: payments due by period (in thousands) obligations total less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years more than 5 years noncancelable contracts $ 26,459 $ 13,197 $ 13,142 $ 120 $ capital leases 303 299 4 operating leases 26,198 3,079 6,033 4,966 12,120 purchase commitments 25,385 21,554 3,831 $ 78,345 $ 38,129 $ 23,010 $ 5,086 $ 12,120 48 in addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the company and rexam beverage can company ( rexam ), dated as of january 1, 2006, the company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period commencing from january 1, 2006 through december 31, 2009. should the company fail to purchase the minimum volume, the company will be obligated to reimburse rexam for certain capital reimbursements on a pro-rated basis. the company maximum liability under this agreement is $8.6 million, subject to compliance by rexam with a number of conditions under this agreement. management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. based on the company current plans, at this time the company estimates that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $10.0 million through december 2007. however, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. in october 2006, the company entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which the company leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in corona, california. this lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months commencing march 2007, excluding renewal options. the monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. the new warehouse and distribution space will replace the company existing warehouse and distribution space located in corona, california. we plan to sublet our existing office, warehouse and distribution space for the remainder of the lease term, unless we are able to find a tenant acceptable to the landlord and the landlord agrees to the early termination of the lease. in october 2006, the company also entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million, located adjacent to the new leased warehouse and distribution facility located in corona, california for the purpose of constructing a new office building thereon which will replace the company existing office space in corona, california. in the interim, the company has leased additional office space located near our existing corporate offices. accounting policies and pronouncements critical accounting policies the company consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements, including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks, as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. the following summarizes the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the company: accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. in circumstances where the company becomes aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to the company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the company believes will ultimately be collected. in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the company recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. 49 inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. the company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the company estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or its ability to sell the product(s) concerned. demand for the company products can fluctuate significantly. factors that could affect demand for the company products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. additionally, management estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. long-lived assets management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. this review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. if there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. the fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management estimates of the business risks. no impairments were identified as of december 31, 2006. management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. management assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. intangibles intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the company exclusive ownership of the hansen trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the monster energy trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. the company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the united states, as well as in a number of countries around the world. the company also owns the blue sky trademark, which was acquired in september 2000, and the junior juice trademark, which was acquired in may 2001. during 2002, the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard ( sfas ) no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets. under the provisions on sfas no. 142, the company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 25 years. in accordance with sfas no. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. if there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. an impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. the fair value is calculated using the income approach. however, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. based on management impairment analysis performed for the year ended december 31, 2006, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying value. 50 in estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the company historical experience. amounts paid to the company by newly appointed ab distributors for the costs of terminating certain of the company prior distributors are accounted for as deferred revenue which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated 20 year life of the respective ab distribution agreements. net sales net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with emerging issues task force issue ( eitf ) no. 01-09. cost of sales cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of our products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the company finished products and certain quality control costs. raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. operating expenses operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport our products to our customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the company prior distributors, depreciation, and other general and administrative costs. stock-based compensation beginning in fiscal year 2006, the company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. the company uses the black-scholes-merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. the black-scholes-merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. the company employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. for example, employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. in addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. the company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. the risk-free rate is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. if actual results are not consistent with the company assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to its results of operations. 51 income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. the company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. if the company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the company judgment. if the company subsequently determines that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. newly issued accounting pronouncements information regarding newly issued accounting pronouncements is contained in part ii, item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2006. sales the table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. a unit case means a unit of measurement equal to 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage. unit case volume of the company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company. sales of food bars and cereals, which have been discontinued and are not material, are expressed in actual cases. the company quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. it has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. because the primary historical market for hansen products is california, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of hansen products expands outside of california. the company experience with its energy drink products, suggests that they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. as the percentage of the company sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in the company reports filed with the securities and exchange commission is not exhaustive. see part i, item 1a. risk factors, for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. we expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which the company is exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, as well as sucrose and high fructose corn syrup, which are used in many of the company products), changes in interest rates on the company long-term debt and limited availability of certain raw materials such as sucralose. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. in addition, we are subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectibility of accounts receivable. at december 31, 2006, the company debt consisted of amounts owed in connection with certain fixed-rate capital leases. there have been no significant changes to the company exposure to market risks.risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. current global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. the global credit and financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruptions in recent months, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions. these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. the current adverse global economic conditions and tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions, and if the current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as the coca-cola company, pepsico inc., cadbury schweppes plc, red bull gmbh, kraft foods inc., nestle beverage company, tree top and ocean spray. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores. our java monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks competes directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, caribou coffee, cinnabon coffee drinks, godiva dairy based drinks and full throttle coffee. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 18 we derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results. a substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our monster energy brand energy drinks. our dsd segment which comprises primarily energy drinks, represented 90.7% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2008. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category. our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, full throttle, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, nos, redline, 180, red devil, rip it, vitaminenergy, 5-hour energy shot, redline energy shot, nos energy shot, rockstar energy shot, full throttle quick shot, amp energy shot and many other brands. a number of companies who market and distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in different packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass bottles, including sobe, snapple, arizona, fuse, and vitamin water, have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products as functional or energy beverages or as having functional benefits. in addition, certain large companies such as tccc and pepsico inc., market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as pepsi max, mountain dew, mountain dew mdx and vault. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues or we could experience price erosion or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results. change in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. there is increasing awareness and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could affect our profitability. consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. additionally, many of our products are considered premium products and to maintain market share during recessionary periods we may have to reduce profit margins which would adversely affect our results of operations. product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we also may be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. we do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. in the event of a disruption or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in the united states with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including hansen brand energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, our pet tea line, hansen sparkling beverages in 10.5-ounce sleek cans, aseptic juice products, juices in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles, monster energy , lost energy , rumba , samba, tango and joker mad energy tm energy drinks in 8.3-ounce and/or 16-ounce and/or 24-ounce 19 and/or 32-ounce and/or 500ml aluminum cans and/or 500ml glass bottles, our java monster tm line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks in 15-ounce cans, monster hitman energy shooter tm and other products. a disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing facilities in the united states with adequate capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. consequently, a disruption in production of such products could adversely affect our revenues. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our dsd products. if we are unable to secure such bottlers and distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. we continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including energy drinks. in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our dsd brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. the tccc north american bottlers and ab distributors are our primary domestic and international distributors of our monster energy beverages. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers and ab distributors, or if the tccc north american bottlers and/or ab distributors do not market and promote our products above the products of our competitors, sales of our monster energy beverages could be adversely affected. our customers are material to our success. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. the dr. pepper snapple group, inc., a former customer of the dsd division, accounted for approximately 13%, 16% and 19% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. our distribution agreement with the dr. pepper snapple group, inc. was terminated by us effective november 9, 2008. the related terminated distributor territories are now serviced by a combination of the tccc north american bottlers and ab distributors. if the tccc north american bottlers and/or ab distributors are generally not as successful in selling our products as the dr. pepper snapple group, inc. was, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), a customer of both the dsd and warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 12% of our net sales for each of the years ended december 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. a decision by wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), or any other large customer, to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. 20 increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, glass bottles and pet plastic bottles as well as juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, milk and cream, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations. overall, the prices of aluminum cans, pet plastic bottles, certain juice concentrates and sugar increased in 2008 as compared to 2007. in addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. we do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. in addition, some of these raw materials, such as sucralose and certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. sucralose, which is used in many of our products including our low-calorie products, is purchased by us from a single manufacturer. while we believe that our 2009 sucralose volume allocation will be sufficient to meet the demand for our products that contain sucralose, we may need to reformulate certain of those products that contain sucralose with alternative sweetener systems to avoid an interruption in supply of those products, should the need arise. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, pet plastic bottles, cans, glass, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain sweeteners, or packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supplies contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as resin for pet bottles, aluminum for cans, pulp for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we fix the prices of certain packaging supplies for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. if we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to 21 us and we may be unable to obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been, and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. if we have to replace a flavor supplier, we could experience temporary disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in and to a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such property with registered and common law trademarks and copyrights, restrictions on disclosure and other actions to prevent infringement. product packages, mechanical designs and artwork are important to our success and we take action to protect against imitation of our packaging and trade dress and to protect our trademarks and copyrights as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. significant changes in government regulation may hinder sales. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products is subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the federal food, drug and cosmetic act; the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. new statutes and regulations may also be instituted in the future. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or packaging changed, thus adversely affecting our financial condition and operations. california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state of california as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. while none of our beverage products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the california list in the future. we also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. if we are unable to maintain brand image or product quality, or if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to maintain and build brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. we have no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preferences. product quality issues, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches. product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. while we have to date not experienced any credible product liability litigation, there is no assurance that we will not experience such litigation in the future. in the event we were to experience product liability claims or a product recall, our financial condition and business operations could be materially adversely effected. 22 if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, or if our retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results will be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels will not be appropriate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance for any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. weather could adversely affect our supply chain and demand for our products. with regard to fruit juice, fruit juice concentrates and natural flavors, the beverage industry is subject to variability of weather conditions, which may result in higher prices and/or the nonavailability of any of such items. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate, particularly in areas outside of california. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other persons and many other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we may be unable to achieve analysts earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others. there can be no assurance that the company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. 23 during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2008, our stock price high was $45.63 and stock price low was $20.52. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 6, 2009, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to control a maximum of 22.1% of our outstanding common stock. consequently, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg could exercise significant control on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2008, we had $256.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $118.7 million in short- and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by u.s. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. certain of our short-term investments and all of our long-term investments are comprised of municipal or educational related or other public body notes with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities ). the majority of these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. the applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. at december 31, 2008, we held auction rate securities with a face value of $112.5 million. subsequent to december 31, 2008, we redeemed $8.1 million of auction rate securities at par, which are included in short-term investments in our consolidated financial statements. during the year ended december 31, 2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. we determined that there was an impairment of our auction rate securities of $14.9 million, resulting in a fair value of $89.6 million, which is included in long-term investments in our consolidated financial statements. we determined that of the $14.9 million impairment of our auction rate securities, $14.4 million was deemed temporary. this amount has been recorded, net of a tax benefit of $5.7 million, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2008. in addition, we determined that $0.5 million of the impairment was other-than-temporary and recorded a charge to interest and other income, net in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2008. there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. the auction failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors. in the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a 24 default rate that is above market rates for similar instruments. the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. as a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. consequently, certain of these securities have been classified as long-term investments in our consolidated financial statements. we anticipate that due to the higher interest rates now payable on certain of these securities and for other reasons, certain issuers are likely to take steps to refinance their notes to enable them to call and repay the securities and therefore avoid the higher interest rates now payable on such securities. if the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record additional impairment charges on these investments. if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. we may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments recorded value. (see part ii, item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks and part ii, item 8, note 3 investments in our consolidated financial statements). if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to do so, our business, results of operations, financial condition or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices and false advertising, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in part i, item 3 legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. defending these proceedings will result in significant ongoing expenditures and the continued diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any of these litigations or legal proceedings could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. operations outside the united states expose us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 8.2% of consolidated gross sales for the year ended december 31, 2008 and our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including 25 possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and the imposition of tariffs or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we have not used instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks and are not protected against foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. we must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems. we rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations. during the fourth quarter of 2008, we resolved to commence the implementation of the sap enterprise resource planning system to replace our legacy systems. the implementation is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2010. this implementation subjects us to take on inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of the internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to a new system. the implementation of this system may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. any information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have an adverse effect on our business and operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar, glucose, sucrose and milk and cream, which are used in many of our products) and limited availability of certain raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. in addition, we are subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of accounts receivable. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. we do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, including, but not limited to, cans, pet plastic bottles, glass, labels, sucrose, glucose, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain sweeteners or packaging arrangements, or protecting against shortages of such ingredients or raw materials. 60 our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 8.2% of consolidated gross sales for the year ended december 31, 2008. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates, as of december 31, 2008, to be significant. for the year ended december 31, 2008 we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. we are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short term investments. certain of our short term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. as a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. at december 31, 2008, we had $256.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $118.7 million in short- and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. government agencies, municipal securities or notes (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by u.s. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. the applicable interest rate on auction rate securities is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. liquidity for auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes. during the year ended december 31, 2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. based on an assessment of fair value as of december 31, 2008, we determined that there was a decline in fair value of our auction rate securities of $14.9 million. we determined that of the $14.9 million decline in fair value of our auction rate securities, $14.4 million was deemed temporary. this amount has been recorded, net of a tax benefit of $5.7 million, as a component of other comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2008. in addition, we determined that the remaining $0.5 million was other than temporary and recorded a charge in other income and expense, net, for the year ended december 31, 2008. there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (see part i, item 1a risk factors our investments in marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments and part i, item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources ).risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. there is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could affect our profitability. consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. additionally, many of our products are considered premium products and to maintain market share during recessionary periods we may have to reduce profit margins, which would adversely affect our results of operations. product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we also may be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. significant changes in government regulation may hinder sales. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the federal food, drug and cosmetic act; the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. new statutes and regulations may also be instituted in the future. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, thus adversely affecting our financial condition and operations. in particular, california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state of california as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. while we do not believe that any of our beverage products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the california list in the future. we also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. public health officials and health advocates are focusing on obesity, especially among children, and are encouraging consumers to reduce consumption of sweetened beverages. possible new local and/or county and/or state and/or federal taxes, increased regulation on labeling and negative publicity may reduce sales of our products and may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 18 additionally, the u.s. food and drug administration has recently proposed revising regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products. if definitive regulation is promulgated, we may incur significant costs to alter our existing packaging materials to comply with such regulations. additionally, revised serving size information may impact and/or reduce and/or otherwise affect the purchase and consumption of our products by our consumers. the ongoing economic downturn and continued uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. the global credit and financial markets have continued to experience extreme disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions. these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. the current adverse global economic conditions and tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions, and if the current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. operations outside the united states expose us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 12.8%, 8.0% and 5.2% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. if we are unable to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have relatively little or no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and promote our brands internationally. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and the imposition of tariffs or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we have not used instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks and are not protected against foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. 19 increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh, the dps group, kraft foods inc., and nestle beverage company. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations such as tree top and ocean spray. our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores. our java monster tm product line competes directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, caribou coffee, cinnabon coffee drinks, godiva dairy based drinks and full throttle coffee. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results. a substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our monster energy brand energy drinks. our dsd segment, which comprises primarily energy drinks, represented 91.9% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2009. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category. our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, full throttle, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, nos, venom, redline, 180, red devil, rip it, vitaminenergy, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee, rockstar roasted, full throttle coffee, 5-hour energy shot, stacker 2, red bull energy shot, redline energy shot, nos energy shot, rockstar energy shot, full throttle quick shot, amp energy shot and many other brands. a number of companies who market and distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in different packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass and plastic bottles, including sobe, snapple, arizona, fuse, and vitamin water, have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products as functional or energy beverages or as having functional benefits. in addition, certain large companies such as tccc and pepsico, market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as pepsi max, mountain dew, mountain dew mdx and vault. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues or we could experience price erosion or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. we do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. in the event of a disruption or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in the united states, canada, australia, brazil, the united kingdom and europe with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of 20 our products, including hansen brand energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, our pet tea line, hansen sparkling beverages in 10.5-ounce sleek cans, aseptic juice products, juices in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles, monster energy , nitrous tm monster energy , x-presso monster tm -hammer, lost energy tm and rumba , samba, tango energy drinks in 6.75-ounce and/or 8.3-ounce and/or 12-ounce and/or 15.5-ounce and/or 16-ounce and/or 24-ounce and/or 32-ounce and/or 500ml aluminum cans and/or 550ml bre aluminum cans and/or 500ml glass bottles and/or 12-ounce, 15-ounce and 24-ounce aluminum cap cans, our java monster tm product line in 15-ounce aluminum cans, monster hitman energy shooter tm s, our peace tea tm product line in 23-ounce aluminum cans and other products. a disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. consequently, a disruption in production of such products could adversely affect our revenues. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our dsd products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. we continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including energy drinks. in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. the tccc north american bottlers and ab distributors are our primary domestic and international distributors of our monster energy beverages. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers and ab distributors, or if the tccc north american bottlers and/or ab distributors do not market and promote our products above the products of our competitors, sales of our monster energy beverages could be adversely affected. the recently announced proposed transactions between cce and tccc could affect our existing distribution arrangements. detailed deal terms have not yet been fully disclosed. we are in the process of evaluating the potential impact the proposed transactions could have on the distribution of our products. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our dsd brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our customers are material to our success. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. the dps group, a former customer of the dsd division, accounted for approximately 13% and 16% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. our distribution agreement with the dps group was terminated by us effective november 9, 2008. the related terminated distributor territories are now serviced by a combination of the tccc north american bottlers and ab distributors. if the tccc north american bottlers and/or ab distributors are generally not as successful in selling our products as the dps group was, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. 21 cce, a customer of the dsd segment with sales in specific markets in the united states, canada, the united kingdom and certain countries in europe, accounted for approximately 27% of our net sales for the year ended december 31, 2009. wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), a customer of both the dsd and warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 9%, 11% and 12% of our net sales for each of the years ended december 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. a decision by cce, wal-mart, inc. (including sam club) or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, pet plastic bottles, as well as juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, milk and cream, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations. in addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. we do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. in addition, some of these raw materials, such as certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, pet plastic bottles, cans, glass, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplements, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, or packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supplies contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as resin for pet bottles, aluminum for cans and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we fix the prices of certain packaging supplies for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 22 we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. if we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. if we must replace a flavor supplier, we could experience temporary disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in and to a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property with registered and common law trademarks and copyrights, restrictions on disclosure and other actions to prevent infringement. however, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to maintain brand image or product quality, or if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to build and maintain brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. we have no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preferences. product quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches. product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. while we have to date not experienced any credible product liability litigation, there is no assurance that we will not experience such litigation in the future. in the event we were to experience product liability claims or a product recall, our financial condition and business operations could be materially adversely effected. if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, or if our retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results will be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels will not be appropriate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. 23 our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance for any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, mr. hall, president of the monster beverage division, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. climate change may negatively affect our business. there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability or increase the cost of certain key ingredients used in our products. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain including, without limitation, the availability of and/or result in higher prices for juice concentrates and natural flavors, or impact demand for our products. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other persons and many other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we may be unable to achieve analysts earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others. there can be no assurance that the company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2009, our stock price high was $44.02 and stock price low was $27.91. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 12, 2010, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to control approximately 24.8% of our outstanding common stock. consequently, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. 24 our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2009, we had $328.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $99.3 million in short- and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by u.s. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. at the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities nor investing in corporate bonds. certain of our short-term investments and all of our long-term investments are comprised of municipal or educational related or other public body notes with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities ). the majority of these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. the applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. at december 31, 2009, we held auction rate securities with a face value of $96.4 million (amortized cost basis of $92.0 million). during the year ended december 31, 2009, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. we determined that there was an impairment of our auction rate securities of $12.1 million, resulting in a fair value of $84.3 million, which is included in short and long-term investments in our consolidated financial statements. we determined that of the $12.1 million impairment of our auction rate securities, $7.7 million was deemed temporary. this amount has been recorded, net of a tax benefit of $3.1 million, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2009. in addition, we determined that $3.9 million of the impairment was an other-than-temporary impairment and recorded a charge in other income (expense) in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2009 ($0.5 million had been previously deemed other-than-temporary and was charged to other income (expense) for the year ended december 31, 2008.) there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. the auction failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors. in the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that is above market rates for similar instruments. the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. as a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. consequently, these securities, except those that were redeemed at par after december 31, 2009 and 2008, are classified as long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. if the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on these investments in the future. if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be 25 required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. we may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments recorded value (see part ii, item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks and part ii, item 8, note 2 and 3 in our consolidated financial statements). if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to do so, our business, results of operations, financial condition or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices and false advertising, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in part i, item 3 legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. defending these proceedings will result in significant ongoing expenditures and the continued diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any of these litigations or legal proceedings could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. we must continually maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems. we rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations. during 2009, we commenced the implementation of the sap enterprise resource planning system to replace our legacy systems in north america. this implementation subjects us to take on inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of the internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to a new system. the implementation of this system may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. any information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have an adverse effect on our business and operations. as of january 2010, we had completed our north american transition to the sap enterprise resource planning system. it is our intention to complete the transition for our international operations within fiscal 2010. we estimate the remaining costs for implementation of the initiative will be approximately $0.8 million. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar, glucose, sucrose and milk and cream, which are used in many of our products) and limited availability of certain raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. in addition, we are subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of accounts receivable. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. we do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 12.8% and 8.0% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign exchange rates. these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2009 to be significant. for the year ended december 31, 2009 we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. we are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short-term and long-term investments. certain of our short-term and long-term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. as a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. at december 31, 2009, we had $328.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $99.3 million in short- and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. government agencies, municipal securities or notes (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by u.s. sub-prime mortgage defaults, which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. at the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities nor investing in corporate bonds. the applicable interest rate on auction rate securities is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. liquidity for auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes. during the years ended december 31, 2009 and 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. based on an assessment of fair value as of december 31, 2009, we determined that there was a decline in fair value of our auction rate securities of $12.1 million. we determined that of the $12.1 million decline in fair value of our auction rate securities at december 31, 2009, $7.7 million was deemed temporary. this amount has been recorded less a tax benefit of $3.1 million, as a component of other comprehensive loss at december 31, 2009. in addition, we determined that the remaining $3.9 million was an other-than-temporary credit loss and recorded a charge in other income (expense) for the year ended december 31, 2009 ($0.5 million had been previously deemed 61 other-than-temporary and was charged to interest and other income, net for the year ended december 31, 2008). there is no assurance that future auctions of any auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (see part i, item 1a risk factors our investments in marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments and part i, item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources ).risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. there is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could affect our profitability. consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. additionally, many of our products are considered premium products and to maintain market share during recessionary periods we may have to reduce profit margins, which would adversely affect our results of operations. product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences chan ge. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we also may be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. significant changes in government regulation may hinder sales. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the federal food, drug and cosmetic act; the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. new statutes and regulations may also be instituted in the future. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, thus adversely affecting our financial condit ion and operations. in particular, california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state of california as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. while we do not believe that any of our beverage products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the california list in the future. we also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. proposals to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or restrict the venues in which energy drinks can be sold, are currently pending before certain state and/or county legislatures. should these current or any future proposals to enact legislation to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or the venues in which energy dr inks can be sold, succeed and/or be enacted by additional states or counties, such legislation could result in a reduction in demand for our energy drinks and adversely affect our results of operations. 20 public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as the disease affects children, and are encouraging consumers to reduce consumption of sweetened beverages. increasing public concern about these issues could result in the implementation of governmental regulations concerning the marketing, labeling or availability of our beverages. the u.s. food and drug administration has recently proposed revising regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products. if definitive regulation is promulgated, we may incur significant costs to alter our existing packaging materials to comply with such regulations. additionally, revised serving size information may impact and/or reduce and/or otherwise affect the purchase and co nsumption of our products by our consumers. the u.s. congress and several state legislatures have considered proposals for excise tax on sweetened beverages. the imposition of such taxes on our products would increase the cost of products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make our products less affordable, both of which could reduce demand for our beverages and adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, the mexican legislature has recently imposed a 25% excise tax on energy drinks, effective as of january 1, 2011. we have adjusted the caffeine levels in our monster energy products that are sold in mexico to address this legislation. however, such actions, or actions by retailers to line price energy drinks generally, could decrease consumer demand for our products and adversely affect our results of operations. furthermore, if similar taxes are imposed in other jurisdictions where we distribute our products, such taxes could adversely affect our results of operations. we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our energy drinks and criticism of our energy drink products and/or the energy drink market generally could adversely affect our operating results. our energy drink products currently generate a substantial portion of our revenues. criticism of our energy drink products, including criticism by healthcare professionals of the nutritional benefits of our energy drink products and other criticism for a variety of reasons, could affect consumer opinions of our energy drink products and result in decreased demand, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and business. the economic downturn and continued uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. during the past few years, the global credit and financial markets experienced extreme disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions. these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. the current adverse global economic conditions and tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. in addition, financial difficulties experien ced by our suppliers or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions, and if the current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 21 operations outside the united states expose us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 16%, 13% and 8% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have relatively little or no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the u.s. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, includ ing: economic or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. such events could impact the production and distribution of our products. in addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. if we are unable to grow our business internationally as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we have not used instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks and are not protected against foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as 22 tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh, the dps group, kraft foods inc., and nestle beverage company. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations such as tree top and ocean spray. our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores. our java monster product line competes directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, seattle best, illy issimo coffee drinks and full throttle coffee. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results. a substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our monster energy brand energy drinks. our dsd segment, which comprises primarily energy drinks, represented 93.0% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2010. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category. domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, full throttle, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, nos, venom, redline, 180, red devil, rip it, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee, rockstar roasted, full throttle coffee, 5-hour energy shot, stacker 2, red bull energy shot, redline energy shot, nos ener gy shot, rockstar energy shot, full throttle quick shot, amp energy shot and many other brands. a number of companies who market and distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in different packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass and plastic bottles, including sobe, snapple, arizona, fuse, and vitamin water, have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products as functional or energy beverages or as having functional benefits. in addition, certain large companies such as tccc and pepsico, market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as pepsi max, mountain dew, mountain dew mdx and vault. internationally, our energy drinks compete with red bull, rockstar, burn, v-energy, lucozade, relentless and numerous local and private label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as play, mother, hell, shock, tiger and a host of other international brands. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues o r we could experience price erosion or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. we do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. in the event of a disruption or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including hansen brand energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, our pet tea line, hansen sparkling beverages in 10.5-ounce sleek cans, aseptic juice products, juices in 64-ounce pet plastic bottles, monster energy , monster energy extra strength nitrous technology tm , x-presso monster , monster energy import and import light, monster energy dub edition, monster rehab , and rumba , samba, tango energy drinks in 6.75-ounce and/or 8.3-ounce and/or 9.6-ounce and/or 12-ounce and/or 15.5-ounce and/or 16-ounce and/or 23.5-ounce and/or 24-ounce and/or 32-ounce and/or 500ml aluminum cans and/or 18.6-ounce bre aluminum cans and/or 5-ounce and/or 500ml glass bottles and/or 12-ounce, 15-ounce and 24-ounce aluminum cap-cans, our java monster tm product line in 15-ounce aluminum cans, worx energy tm 23 energy shots, our peace tea tm product line in 23-ounce aluminum cans and other products. a disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. consequently, a disruption in production of such products could adversely affect our revenues. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our dsd products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. we continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including energy drinks. in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. the tccc north american bottlers, ab distributors, new cce and coca-cola hellenic are our primary domestic and international distributors of our monster energy beverages. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers and/or the ab distributors and/or new cce and/or coca-cola hellenic, or if the tccc north american bottlers and/or ab distributors and/or new cce and/or coca-cola hellenic do not focus on marketing and promoting our products in preference to the products of our competitors, sales of our monster energy beverages could be adversely affected. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our dsd brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our customers are material to our success. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. the dps group, a former customer of the dsd segment, accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales for the year ended december 31, 2008. our distribution agreement with the dps group was terminated by us effective november 9, 2008. the related terminated distributor territories are now serviced by a combination of the tccc north american bottlers and ab distributors. if the tccc north american bottlers and/or ab distributors are generally not as successful in selling our products as the dps group was, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. cce (including ccbc up to september 30, 2010) (cce replaced by new cce from october 1, 2010), accounted for approximately 28% and 27% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), a customer of both the dsd and warehouse segments, accounted for less than 10% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2010 and 2009 and approximately 11% of our net sales for the year ended december 31, 2008. a decision by ccr, ccrc, new cce, wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), coca-cola hellenic, or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. 24 increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, pet plastic bottles, as well as juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, milk and cream, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations. in addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have risen recently, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. we are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. in addition, some of these raw materials, such as certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, pet plastic bottles, cans, glass, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplements, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea or packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse e ffect on our business and financial results. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supplies contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as resin for pet plastic bottles, aluminum for cans and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we fix the prices of certain packaging supplies for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to ou r customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. if we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. if we must replace a flavor supplier, we could experience temporary disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 25 our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in and to a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property with registered and common law trademarks and copyrights, restrictions on disclosure and other actions to prevent infringement. however, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to maintain brand image or product quality, or if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to build and maintain brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. we have no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preference and demand. product quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches. product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. while we have to date not experienced any credible product liability litigation, there is no assurance that we will not experience such litigation in the future. in the event we were to experience product liability claims or a product recall, our financial condition and business operations could be materially adversely affected. if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, or if our retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results will be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels will not be appropriate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance for any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. 26 climate change may negatively affect our business. there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability or increase the cost of certain key ingredients and juice concentrates used in our products. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain including, without limitation, the availability of and/or result in higher prices for juice concentrates and natural flavors, or impact demand for our products. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other persons and many other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we may be unable to achieve analysts earnings forecasts, which may be based on their own projected volumes and sales of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. there can be no assurance that the company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales and/or revenues and/or gross margins and/or operating profits and/or net income. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volati lity and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2010, our stock price high was $54.75 and stock price low was $24.01. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 22, 2011, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own approximately 20% of our outstanding common stock. consequently, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. 27 our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2010, we had $354.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $288.8 million in short- and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by the u.s. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. certain of our short-term investments and all of our long-term investments are comprised of municipal or educational related or other public body notes with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities ). a large portion of these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. the applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. during the years ended december 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed, and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed. the auction failures have been attributable to inadequate buye rs and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors. in the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that may be above market rates for similar instruments. the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their pre-determined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. as a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. at december 31, 2010, we held auction rate securities with a face value of $79.6 million (amortized cost basis of $70.7 million). a level 3 valuation was performed on our auction rate securities as of december 31, 2010 resulting in a fair value of $25.4 million for our available-for-sale auction rate securities (after a $7.4 million impairment) and $42.9 million for our trading auction rate securities, which are included in short- and long-term investments. in march 2010, we entered into an agreement (the ars agreement ), related to $54.2 million in par value auction rate securities ( ars securities ). under the ars agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell these ars securities including all accrued but unpaid interest (the put option ) as follows: (i) on or after march 22, 2011, up to $1 3.6 million aggregate par value; and (ii) semi-annual or annual installments thereafter with full sale rights available on or after march 22, 2013. the ars securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the put option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the respective ars securities when the auction process fails. during the year ended december 31, 2010, $7.4 million of par value ars securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels. 28 if the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on these investments in the future. if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. we may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments recorded value (see part ii, item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks and part ii, item 8, notes 2 and 3 in our consolidated financial stat ements ). if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to do so, our business, results of operations, financial condition or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices and false advertising, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in part i, item 3 legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 9 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. defending these proceedings will result in significant ongoing expenditures and the continued diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. we must continually maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems. information technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. if our data management systems, including our sap enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulati ons will be impaired, perhaps materially. any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose and milk and cream, all of which are used in some or many of our products) and limited availability of certain raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. in addition, we ar e subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of accounts receivable and inventory realization. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. we do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 16% and 13% of consolidated gross sales for both the years ended december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2010 to be significant. for the year ended december 31, 2010 we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. we are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short-term and long-term investments. certain of our short-term and long-term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. as a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. at december 31, 2010, we had $354.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $288.8 million in short- and long-term investments including u.s. treasuries, certificates of deposit, municipal securities, u.s. government agency securities, variable rate demand notes and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature). certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by u.s. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. at the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities nor investing in corporate bonds. 62 in march 2010, we entered into the ars agreement, related to $54.2 million in par value auction rate securities. under the ars agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell the ars securities including all accrued but unpaid interest as follows: (i) on or after march 22, 2011, up to $13.6 million aggregate par value; and (ii) semi-annual or annual installments thereafter with full sale rights available on or after march 22, 2013. the ars securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the put option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the ars securities when the auction process fails. as of december 31, 2010, we recorded $3.8 million as the fair market value of the put option ($3.0 million current portion included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $0 .8 million long-term portion included in other assets) in the consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding gain of $3.8 million recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2010. in connection with the ars agreement, during the first fiscal quarter of 2010, we reclassified $54.2 million of auction rate securities from available-for-sale to trading, as we have the ability and intent to exercise the related put option beginning march 22, 2011. we recognized a loss on trading securities of $3.9 million through earnings during the year ended december 31, 2010. during the year ended december 31, 2010, $7.4 million of par value ars securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels. the applicable interest rate on our auction rate securities is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. liquidity for auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes. during the years ended december 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. based on an assessment of fair value as of december 31, 2010, we determined that there was a decline in fair value of our available for sale auction rate securities of $7.4 million. we determined that of the $7.4 million decline in fair value of our auction rate securities at december 31, 2010, $2.4 million was deemed temporary and $5.0 million was deemed other-than-temporary. at december 31, 2010, $2.4 million of temporary impairment has been recorded, less a tax benefit of $1.0 million, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). we recorded a net charge through earnings of $0.6 million of other-than-temporary impairment that was deemed credit loss related during the year ended december 31, 2010 ($3.9 million and $0.5 million had been previously deemed other-than-temporary credit loss related and were charged through earnings for the years ended december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively). there is no assurance that future auctions of any auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (see part i, item 1a risk factors our investments are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments and part i, item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources ).risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. significant changes in government regulation may hinder sales. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the federal food, drug and cosmetic act; the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. outside the united states, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations. new statutes and regulations may also be instituted in the future. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, thus adversely affecting our financial condition and operations. in particular, california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state of california as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects above certain levels. while we do not believe that any of our beverage products are currently required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the california list in the future. we also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. proposals to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or restrict the venues in which energy drinks can be sold and/or to impose taxation on the sale of energy drinks, continue to emerge and are currently pending before certain state and/or county and/or other foreign country legislatures. should these current or any future proposals to enact legislation to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or the venues in which energy drinks can be sold and/or to impose taxation of the sale of energy drinks, succeed and/or be enacted by additional states, counties and/or other jurisdictions, such legislation could result in a reduction in demand for our energy drinks and adversely affect our results of operations. public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as the disease affects children, and are encouraging consumers to reduce consumption of sweetened beverages. increasing public concern about these issues could result in the implementation of governmental regulations concerning the marketing, labeling or availability of our beverages. the u.s. food and drug administration has proposed revising regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products. if such definitive regulation is promulgated, we may incur significant costs to alter our existing packaging materials to comply with such regulations. additionally, revised serving size information may impact and/or reduce and/or otherwise affect the purchase and consumption of our products by our consumers. the u.s. congress and several state legislatures have considered proposals to impose an excise tax on sweetened beverages. the imposition of such taxes on our products would increase the cost of products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make our products less affordable, both of which could reduce demand for our beverages and adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, on january 1, 2011, the mexican legislature imposed a 25% excise tax on energy drinks. we have adjusted the caffeine levels in our monster energy products that are sold in mexico to address this legislation. in 2011, hungary implemented a tax on energy drinks. in light of this tax, we are adjusting the formulation of our energy drinks in hungary. however, such actions, or other actions by retailers to line price energy 17 table of contents drinks generally irrespective of tax treatment, could decrease consumer demand for our products and adversely affect our results of operations. furthermore, if similar taxes are imposed in other jurisdictions where we distribute our products, such taxes could result in a reduction in demand for our energy drinks and adversely affect our results of operations. we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our energy drinks and criticism of our energy drink products and/or of the energy drink market generally could adversely affect our operating results. our energy drink products currently generate the vast majority of our revenues. criticism of our energy drink products, including criticism by healthcare professionals of the nutritional benefits of our energy drink products and other criticism for a variety of reasons, could affect consumer opinions of our energy drink products and result in decreased demand, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and business. increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and promotion and marketing strategies. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in many cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh, the dps group, kraft foods inc., glaxosmithkline plc, and nestle beverage company. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. continued uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. in 2011, the global economy improved as compared to 2010, however uncertainty continues to exist as to the overall rate and stability of the recovery. more recently, turmoil in the european credit markets and the sovereign debt crisis in the euro-zone have posed potential threats to global growth and market stability, and european growth and stability in particular, and thereby increased global macroeconomic uncertainties. these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. the current global economic conditions may lead consumers to decrease spending, or change their existing and future purchasing habits for cheaper alternatives. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or customers could result in product delays, possible accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. there can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad-based and sustainable, or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. in addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of the current disruptions in europe or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the united states has increased our exposure to any 18 table of contents crisis in european and other international markets. additionally, many of our products are considered premium products and to maintain market share during recessionary periods we may have to reduce profit margins, which could adversely affect our results of operations. if the improved economic conditions are slower than anticipated or if conditions worsen, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. there is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we also may be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. operations outside the united states expose us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 20%, 16% and 13% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business. if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some areas we have no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the u.s. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. such events 19 table of contents could impact the production and distribution of our products. in addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. if we are unable to grow our business internationally as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we have not used instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks and are not protected against foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. we derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results. a substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our monster energy brand energy drinks. our dsd segment, which is comprised primarily of energy drinks, represented 94.4% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2011. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the more recently emerging energy shot category. domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, full throttle, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, nos, venom, redline, 180, red devil, rip it, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee, rockstar roasted, full throttle coffee, 5-hour energy shots, stacker 2, vpx redline energy shots and many other brands. a number of companies who market and distribute iced teas, juice cocktails and enhanced waters in different packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass and plastic bottles, including sobe, sobe life water, snapple, arizona, fuse, ocean spray, honest tea, gold peak tea, activate, neuro and vitamin water, have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products as functional or energy beverages or as having functional benefits. in addition, certain large companies such as tccc and pepsico, market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as pepsi max, mountain dew, mountain dew mdx and vault. internationally, our energy drinks compete with red bull, rockstar, burn, v-energy, lucozade, relentless and numerous local and private label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as power play, mother, hell, shock, tiger and a host of other international brands. our java monster product line competes directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, seattle best, illy issimo coffee drinks and full throttle coffee. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues and/or we could experience price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. we do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. in the event of a disruption and/or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including monster energy , monster rehab , monster energy extra strength nitrous technology , x-presso monster , monster energy import and import light, monster energy dub edition energy drinks and monster 20 table of contents energy m3 super concentrate in 6.75-ounce and/or 8.3-ounce and/or 9.6-ounce and/or 12-ounce and/or 15.5-ounce and/or 16-ounce and/or 23.5-ounce and/or 24-ounce and/or 32-ounce and/or 500ml aluminum cans and/or 18.6-ounce bre aluminum cans and/or 5-ounce glass bottles and/or 12-ounce, 15-ounce and 24-ounce aluminum cap cans, our java monster product line in 15-ounce aluminum cans, worx energy energy shots in 2-ounce wide-mouth pet plastic bottles, our peace tea product line in 23-ounce aluminum cans, our hansen brand energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, aseptic juice products in 4.23-ounce and 6.75-ounce aseptic boxes, our hubert lemonades in 16-ounce glass bottles, our hubert half &amp; half in 16-ounce aluminum cans and other products. a disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. consequently, a disruption in production of such products could adversely affect our revenues. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our dsd segment products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including energy drinks. in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. the tccc north american bottlers, ab distributors, new cce and coca-cola hellenic are our primary domestic and international distributors of our monster energy beverages. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers and/or the ab distributors and/or new cce and/or coca-cola hellenic, or if the tccc north american bottlers and/or ab distributors and/or new cce and/or coca-cola hellenic do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our monster energy beverages could be adversely affected. we continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers and/or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our dsd segment brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our customers are material to our success. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. ccr accounted for approximately 29% of our net sales for the year ended december 31, 2011. cce accounted for approximately 28% and 27% our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. a decision by ccr, ccrc, new cce, wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), coca-cola hellenic, or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. 21 table of contents increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, pet plastic bottles, as well as juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, supplements, milk and cream, the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. in addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have risen, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. we are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials although we do, from time to time, enter into purchase agreements for a significant portion of our annual anticipated requirements for certain raw materials such as aluminum cans, apple juice and sugar. in addition, some of these raw materials, such as certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, pet plastic bottles, glass, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplements, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea or packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. if we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. if we must replace a flavor supplier, we could experience temporary disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 22 table of contents our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in and to a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property with registered and common law trademarks and copyrights, restrictions on disclosure and other actions to prevent infringement. however, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to maintain brand image or product quality, or if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to build and maintain brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. we have no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preference and demand. product quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches. product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. while we have to date not experienced any credible product liability litigation, there is no assurance that we will not experience such litigation in the future. in the event we were to experience product liability claims or a product recall, our financial condition and business operations could be materially adversely affected. if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels and/or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if our retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results could be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. 23 table of contents climate change may negatively affect our business. there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates and supplements used in our products. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for, juice concentrates, natural flavors and supplements or impact demand for our products. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties and many other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we may be unable to achieve analysts earnings forecasts, which may be based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of sales revenues, gross margin and operating expenses. there can be no assurance that we will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales and/or revenues and/or gross margins and/or operating profits and/or net income. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2011, our stock price high was $49.18 and stock price low was $25.84, as adjusted for the stock split. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 9, 2012, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock. consequently, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. 24 table of contents our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals. although we currently have sufficient cash to support our planned operating activities in the current year, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities in the future. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2011, we had $359.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $434.5 million in short- and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by the u.s. sub-prime mortgage defaults that continue to affect various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. certain of our short-term investments and all of our long-term investments are comprised of municipal or educational related or other public body notes with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities ). liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. since 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed, and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed. at december 31, 2011, we held auction rate securities with a face value of $44.8 million (amortized cost basis of $35.9 million). in june 2011, we entered into an agreement (the 2011 ars agreement ), related to $24.5 million of par value auction rate securities (the 2011 ars securities ). under the 2011 ars agreement, we have the right to sell the 2011 ars securities including all accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the 2011 put option ) as follows: (i) on or after july 1, 2013, up to $1.0 million aggregate par value; (ii) on or after october 1, 2013, up to an additional $1.0 million aggregate par value; and (iii) in quarterly installments thereafter based on a formula of the then outstanding 2011 ars securities, as adjusted for normal market redemptions, with full sale rights available on or after april 1, 2016. during the year ended december 31, 2011, $3.7 million of par value 2011 ars securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels. in march 2010, we entered into an agreement (the 2010 ars agreement ), related to $54.2 million of par value auction rate securities (the 2010 ars securities ). under the 2010 ars agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell the 2010 ars securities including all accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the 2010 put option ) as follows: (i) on or after march 22, 2011, up to $13.6 million aggregate par value; and (ii) equal semi-annual or annual installments thereafter with full sale rights available on or after march 22, 2013. during the year ended december 31, 2011, $27.1 million of par value 2010 ars securities were redeemed at par through the exercise of the 2010 put option and $4.0 million of par value 2010 ars securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels ($7.4 million of par value 2010 ars securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels during the year ended december 31, 2010). 25 table of contents if the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on these investments in the future. if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. we may be required to wait until market stability is restored to redeem these instruments, for the related put options to be exercisable, or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments recorded value (see part ii, item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks and part ii, item 8, notes 2 and 3 in our consolidated financial statements ). if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to do so, our business, results of operations, financial condition or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices and false advertising, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in part i, item 3 legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 9 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. defending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. we must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems. information technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including cybersecurity attacks. cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. moreover, if our data management systems, including our sap enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack, or human error, our 26 table of contents ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose and milk and cream, all of which are used in some or many of our products) and limited availability of certain raw materials. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 20% and 16% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2011 to be significant. for the year ended december 31, 2011 we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. we are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short-term and long-term investments. certain of our short-term and long-term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. as a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. at december 31, 2011, we had $359.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $434.5 million in short-term and long-term investments including u.s. treasuries, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds, municipal securities, u.s. government agency securities, variable rate demand notes and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature). certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. at the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities. 57 table of contents in june 2011, we entered into the 2011 ars agreement, related to $24.5 million of par value auction rate securities. under the 2011 ars agreement, we have the right to sell the 2011 ars securities including all accrued but unpaid interest as follows: (i) on or after july 1, 2013, up to $1.0 million aggregate par value; (ii) on or after october 1, 2013, up to an additional $1.0 million aggregate par value; and (iii) in quarterly installments thereafter based on a formula of the then outstanding 2011 ars securities, as adjusted for normal market redemptions, with full sale rights available on or after april 1, 2016. the 2011 ars securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the 2011 put option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the respective 2011 ars securities when the auction process fails. under the 2011 ars agreement, we have the obligation, should we receive written notification from the put issuer, to sell the 2011 ars securities at par including all accrued but unpaid interest. in march 2010, we entered into the 2010 ars agreement, related to $54.2 million of par value auction rate securities. under the 2010 ars agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell the 2010 ars securities including all accrued but unpaid interest as follows: (i) on or after march 22, 2011, up to $13.6 million aggregate par value; and (ii) equal semi-annual or annual installments thereafter with full sale rights available on or after march 22, 2013. the 2010 ars securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the 2010 put option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the 2010 ars securities when the auction process fails. during the year ended december 31, 2011, $4.0 million of par value 2010 ars securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels ($7.4 million of par value 2010 ars securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels during the year ended december 31, 2010). during the year ended december 31, 2011, $27.1 million of par value 2010 ars securities were redeemed at par through the exercise of the 2010 put option. during the year ended december 31, 2011, $3.7 million of par value 2011 ars securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels. the applicable interest rate on our auction rate securities is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. liquidity for auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes. since 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. there is no assurance that future auctions of any auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. if the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on these investments in the future. we may be required to wait until market stability is restored to redeem these instruments, the related put options become exercisable, or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments recorded value.risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. legislation has been proposed at the u.s. federal, state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size, or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. for a discussion of certain of such legislation, see part i, item 1 business government regulation. furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the united states and other countries at the federal, state and municipal level in respect of each of the foregoing subject areas. public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as the disease affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. there also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages. to the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are sold individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for our energy drinks and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are also currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the federal food, drug and cosmetic act, including as amended by the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. outside the united states, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we cannot predict the effect of inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general and/or other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products. we are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks. in july 2012, we received a subpoena from a state attorney general in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our monster energy brand energy drinks. as the investigation is in an early stage, we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what, if any, effect it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 18 table of contents litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products. in 2012, we were named as a defendant in a product liability lawsuit, which alleged that the consumption of two 24-ounce cans of monster energy over the course of two days, caused the wrongful death of a fourteen year old girl (anais fournier) in december 2011. we do not believe that our products are responsible for the death of ms. fournier and intend to continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit. in addition, another product liability lawsuit was filed against us in 2012, which we believe to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend. in october 2012, we received a letter from the city attorney of san francisco, dennis j. herrera, requesting support for our promotional slogans and citing a california state law that makes it illegal to make false or misleading advertising claims that purport to be based on fact or clinical data. while mr. herrera has not alleged any wrong-doing, there can be no assurance that he or other parties will not seek to take action against us alleging that the advertising of certain of our products was not in compliance with california law. we have provided a written response to this letter. in 2012, several lawsuits were filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading in nature and/or that our products are not safe. putative class action lawsuits have also recently been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their advertisements amount to false advertising. we do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or that our products are in any way unsafe and intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits. any of the foregoing matters or other product-related litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation, could consume significant financial and managerial resources, and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards against us and injury to our reputation. criticism of our energy drink products, and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally, could adversely affect us. an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content in our products or energy drinks generally, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and/or indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have recently been published. we believe that the softness in the energy drink market in the u.s. over the past few months may be due in part to the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continued to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine) and/or the levels thereof and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. if reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, they could adversely affect the demand for our products. increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and promotion and marketing strategies. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in many cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known 19 table of contents producers such as tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh, the dps group, kraft foods inc., glaxosmithkline plc, nestle beverage company, tree top and ocean spray. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. continued uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. in 2012, the global economy improved as compared to 2011, however uncertainty continues to exist as to the overall rate and stability of the recovery. global economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. there can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be sustainable, or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. in addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of the recent disruptions in europe or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the united states has increased our exposure to any crisis in european and other international markets. if the improved economic conditions are slower than anticipated or if conditions worsen, our industry, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. there is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we also may be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. operations outside the united states expose us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 22%, 20% and 16% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business. if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some areas we have no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international 20 table of contents operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the u.s. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. such events could impact the production and distribution of our products. in addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. if we are unable to grow our business internationally as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we have not used instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks and are not protected against foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. we derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results. a substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our monster energy brand energy drinks. our dsd segment, which is comprised primarily of energy drinks, represented 95.4% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2012. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the more recently emerging energy shot category. domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, full throttle, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, nos, venom, redline, 180, red devil, xenergy, mio energy, rip it, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee, rockstar roasted, full throttle coffee, 5-hour energy shots, stacker 2, vpx redline energy shots and many other brands. a number of companies who market and distribute iced teas, juice cocktails and enhanced waters in different packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass and plastic bottles, including sobe, sobe life water, snapple, arizona, fuse, ocean spray, honest tea, gold peak tea, activate, neuro and vitamin water, have added dietary ingredients to their products with a view to marketing their products as functional or energy beverages or as having functional benefits. in addition, certain large companies such as tccc and pepsico, market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as pepsi max, mountain dew, mountain 21 table of contents dew mdx and vault. internationally, our energy drinks compete with red bull, rockstar, burn, v-energy, lucozade, adrenaline rush, relentless and numerous local and private label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as power play, mother, hell, shock, tiger, boost, gladiator, speed, tnt, shark, hot 6, shark energy, nalu, battery, bullit, flash up, black, non-stop, bomba, semtex and a host of other international brands. our java monster product line competes directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, seattle best, illy issimo coffee drinks and full throttle coffee. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues and/or we could experience price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. we do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. in the event of a disruption and/or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including our monster energy brand energy drinks, our worx energy energy shots, our peace tea product line, our hansen brand energy drinks, our aseptic juice products, our hubert lemonades and other products. while we believe a short-term disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenue, a lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any of such products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products because alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our dsd segment products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including energy drinks. in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. the tccc north american bottlers, ab distributors, new cce and coca-cola hellenic are our primary domestic and international distributors of our monster energy products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers and/or the ab distributors and/or new cce and/or coca-cola hellenic, or if the tccc north american bottlers and/or ab distributors and/or new cce and/or coca-cola hellenic do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our monster energy products could be adversely affected. we continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers and/or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our dsd segment brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 22 table of contents we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. if we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of flavor ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. if we must replace a flavor supplier, we could experience a temporary disruption in our ability to deliver products to our customers and/or a reduction in demand for our products containing replacement flavors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our customers are material to our success. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. ccr accounted for approximately 28% and 29% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. a decision by ccr, ccrc, new cce, wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), coca-cola hellenic, or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, pet plastic bottles, as well as juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, dietary ingredients, milk and cream, the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. in addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. we are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials although we do, from time to time, enter into purchase agreements for a significant portion of our annual anticipated requirements for certain raw materials such as aluminum cans, apple juice and sugar. in addition, some of these raw materials, including certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, pet plastic bottles, glass bottles, labels, sucralose, flavors, dietary ingredients, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, packaging materials or co-packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 23 table of contents the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in and to a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. however, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to maintain our brand image or product quality, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to build and maintain brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. there can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preference and demand. product quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports, studies and articles and regulatory or other governmental inquiries, in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors, as well as proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer and we may incur material losses. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise materially not compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. 24 table of contents if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels and/or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if our retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results could be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. climate change may negatively affect our business. there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates and dietary ingredients used in our products. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for, juice concentrates, natural flavors and dietary ingredients or impact demand for our products. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. 25 table of contents volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties and many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. we do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. we may be unable to achieve analysts earnings forecasts, which may be based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of sales revenues, gross margin and operating expenses. there can be no assurance that we will achieve any projected levels or mixes of product sales and/or revenues and/or gross margins and/or operating profits and/or net income. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012, our stock price high was $83.96 and stock price low was $39.99, as adjusted for the 2-for-1 split of our common stock that occurred on february 15, 2012. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 25, 2013, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 18% of our outstanding common stock. consequently, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals. although we currently have sufficient cash to support our planned operating activities in the current year, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities in the future. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2012, we had $222.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $118.4 million in short- and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. these risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to do so, our business, results of operations, financial condition or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. 26 table of contents litigation, legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices and false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in part i, item 3 legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 9 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. defending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. we must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems. information technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including cybersecurity attacks. cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. moreover, if our data management systems, including our sap enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose and milk and cream, all of which are used in some or many of our products) and limited availability of certain raw materials. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. 58 table of contents our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 22% and 20% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2012 to be significant. for the year ended december 31, 2012, we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. we are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short-term and long-term investments. certain of our short-term and long-term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. as a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates as of december 31, 2012 to be significant. as of december 31, 2012, we had $222.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $118.4 million in short-term and long-term investments including u.s. treasuries, certificates of deposit and municipal securities which may have an auction reset feature. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. at the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities.risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the u.s. federal, state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size, or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. for a discussion of certain of such legislation, see part i, item 1 business government regulation. furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the united states and other countries at the federal, state, local and municipal level in respect of each of the foregoing subject areas. public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as the disease affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. there also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages. to the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are sold individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for our energy drinks and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are also currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the ffdc act, including as amended by the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. outside the united states, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we cannot predict the effect of inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general and/or other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products. we are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks. in july 2012, we received a subpoena from a state attorney general in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our monster energy brand energy drinks. we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what, if any, effect it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 19 table of contents litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products. in 2012, we were named as a defendant in a product liability lawsuit, which alleged that the consumption of two 24-ounce cans of monster energy over the course of two days, caused the wrongful death of a fourteen year old girl (anais fournier) in december 2011. we do not believe that our products are responsible for the death of ms. fournier and intend to continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit. in addition, another product liability lawsuit was filed against us in 2012, which we believe to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend. we have also been named as a defendant in certain other complaints containing similar allegations to those presented in the fournier lawsuit, each of which we believe is also without merit and would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in the event any damages were awarded. in october 2012, we received a written request for information from the city attorney for the city and county of san francisco (the city attorney ) concerning our advertising and marketing of our monster energy brand of energy drinks and specifically concerning the safety of our products for consumption by adolescents. in a subsequent letter, the city attorney threatened to bring suit against us if we did not agree to take certain steps immediately and, on may 6, 2013, the city attorney filed a complaint against us for declaratory and injunctive relief, civil penalties and restitution for an alleged violation of california unfair competition law. we deny that we have violated the unfair competition law or any other law and believe that the city attorney claims and demands are preempted and unconstitutional. we intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. at this time, no evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or range of potential loss can be expressed. several other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading in nature and/or that our products are not safe. putative class action lawsuits have also recently been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their advertisements amount to false advertising. we do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or that our products are in any way unsafe and intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits. any of the foregoing matters or other product-related litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation, could consume significant financial and managerial resources, and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards against us and injury to our reputation. criticism of our energy drink products, and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally, could adversely affect us. an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content in our products or energy drinks generally, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and/or indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published in recent years. we believe that the softness in the overall energy drink market in the u.s. that has been experienced may be due in part to the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine) and/or the levels thereof and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. if reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, they could adversely affect the demand for our products. 20 table of contents increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning as well as promotion and marketing strategies. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in many cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh, the dps group, kraft foods inc., suntory holding, ltd., nestle beverage company, tree top and ocean spray. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. in 2013, the global economy improved as compared to 2012, however uncertainty continues to exist as to the overall rate and stability of the recovery. global economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. there can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be sustainable, or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. in addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets, or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the united states has increased our exposure to any crisis in european and other international markets. if the improved economic conditions are slower than anticipated or if conditions worsen, our industry, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. there is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. recently, concerns have emerged regarding diet sodas and in particular, aspartame, which we do not use in our products. consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we 21 table of contents currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we also may be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. operations outside the united states expose us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 23%, 22% and 20% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business. if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some areas we have no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the u.s. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. such events could impact the production and distribution of our products. in addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. if we are unable to grow our business internationally as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we have not used instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks and are not protected against foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. we derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results. a substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our monster energy brand energy drinks. our dsd segment, which is comprised primarily of energy 22 table of contents drinks, represented 95.6% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2013. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the more recently emerging energy shot category. domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, full throttle, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, nos, venom, redline, red devil, xenergy, mio energy, rip it, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee, rockstar roasted, 5-hour energy shots, stacker 2, vpx redline energy shots and many other brands. a number of companies who market and distribute iced teas, juice cocktails and enhanced waters in different packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass and plastic bottles, including sobe, sobe life water, snapple, arizona, fuse, ocean spray, honest tea, gold peak tea, activate, neuro and vitamin water, have added dietary ingredients to their products with a view to marketing their products as functional or energy beverages or as having functional benefits. in addition, certain large companies such as tccc and pepsico, market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as pepsi max, mountain dew, mountain dew mdx, mountain dew kickstart and vault. internationally, our energy drinks compete with red bull, rockstar, burn, v-energy, lucozade, adrenaline rush, relentless and numerous local and private label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as power play, mother, hell, shock, tiger, boost, speed, tnt, shark, hot 6, shark energy, nalu, battery, bullit, flash up, black, non-stop, bomba, semtex, vive 100, dark dog, speed, guaran , ultra and a host of other international brands. our java monster product line competes directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, seattle best and illy issimo coffee drinks. our muscle monster product line competes directly with muscle milk, core power, abb pure pro and gatorade recover protein shake. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues and/or we could experience price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. we do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. in the event of a disruption and/or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including our monster energy brand energy drinks, our worx energy energy shots, our peace tea product line, our hansen brand energy drinks, our aseptic juice products, our hubert lemonades, our muscle monster product line, our java monster product line and certain of our other products. while we believe a short-term disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenue, a lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any of such products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products because alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our dsd segment products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including energy drinks. in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. 23 table of contents the tccc north american bottlers, ab distributors, new cce and coca-cola hellenic are our primary domestic and international distributors of our monster energy products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers and/or the ab distributors and/or new cce and/or coca-cola hellenic, or if the tccc north american bottlers and/or ab distributors and/or new cce and/or coca-cola hellenic do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our monster energy products could be adversely affected. we continually seek to expand and/or improve the distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers and/or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our dsd segment brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. if we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of flavor ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. if we must replace a flavor supplier, we could experience a temporary disruption in our ability to deliver products to our customers and/or a reduction in demand for our products containing replacement flavors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our customers are material to our success. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. ccr accounted for approximately 29% and 28% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. a decision by ccr, ccrc, new cce, the ab distributors, wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), coca-cola hellenic, or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, pet plastic bottles, as well as flavors, juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, dietary ingredients and other packaging materials; the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. in addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. we are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials although we do, from time to time, enter into purchase agreements for a significant portion of our annual anticipated requirements for certain raw materials such as aluminum cans, apple juice, sugar and sucralose. 24 table of contents in addition, some of these raw materials, including certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, pet plastic bottles, glass bottles, labels, sucralose, flavors, dietary ingredients, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, protein, packaging materials or co-packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels and/or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if our customers or retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results could be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. 25 table of contents we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in and to a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. however, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to maintain our brand image or product quality, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. there can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preference and demand. product quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media, internet or elsewhere, studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries, in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors, as well as proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer and we may incur material losses. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise materially not compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. climate change may negatively affect our business. there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates and dietary ingredients used in our products. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for juice concentrates, natural flavors and dietary ingredients or impact demand for our products. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a 26 table of contents long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. we do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. we may be unable to achieve analysts net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which may be based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. there can be no assurance that we will achieve any projected levels or mixes of product sales and/or revenues and/or gross margins and/or operating profits and/or net income. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013, our stock price high was $68.33 and our stock price low was $45.38. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 24, 2014, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 13% of our outstanding common stock. consequently, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals. although we currently have sufficient cash to support our planned operating activities in the current year, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities in the future. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our debtors and/or creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. 27 table of contents our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2013, we had $211.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $402.2 million in short-term investments and $9.8 million of long-term investments (comprised entirely of auction rate securities). we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. these risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to do so, our business, results of operations, financial condition or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. litigation, legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in part i, item 3 legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 9 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. defending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. we must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems. information technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including cybersecurity attacks. cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. moreover, if our data management systems, including our sap enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively 28 table of contents collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream and protein, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 23% and 22% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2013 to be significant. for the year ended december 31, 2013, we did not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. we are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short-term and long-term investments. certain of our short-term and long-term investments are subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. as a result, the market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates as of december 31, 2013 to be significant. as of december 31, 2013, we had $211.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $412.0 million in short-term and long-term investments including u.s. treasuries, certificates of deposit and municipal securities which may have an auction reset feature. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. at the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities.risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. following the tccc transaction, newco and tccc will have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, newco future performance is expected to substantially depend on the success of its relationship with tccc. in connection with the tccc transaction, the amended distribution coordination agreements to be entered into with tccc will provide for the transition of third parties rights to distribute the company products in most territories in the u.s. to members of tccc distribution network, which consists of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottling/distribution partners. on february 9, 2015 in accordance with its existing agreements with the applicable third-party distributors, the company sent notices of termination to certain affected third-party distributors, including the majority of the ab distributors in the u.s., providing for the termination of their respective distribution agreements, to be effective at various dates beginning in march 2015. the associated distribution rights will be transferred to tccc distribution network in each applicable territory as of the effective date of the termination of the applicable third party rights in such territory. in addition, it is expected that tccc will become our preferred distribution partner globally. as a result, we will be reducing our distributor diversification and will be substantially dependent on tccc international distribution platform. also in connection with the tccc transaction, tccc will make a substantial equity investment in newco and has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete in the energy drink category. while we believe that this will incentivize tccc to take steps to assure that our products receive the appropriate attention in the tccc distribution system, there can be no assurance of this as tccc is a much larger company with many strategic priorities. in addition, tccc does not control all members of its distribution system, many of which are independent companies that make their own business decisions that may not always align with tccc interests. moreover, it is also possible that we may fail to recognize the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements regardless of tccc priorities or the priorities of the members of tccc distribution system. in any such case, our operating results could suffer and the value of newco common shares could be adversely affected. under the terms of the tccc transaction, we have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete with tccc in the non-energy drink category following the closing. as a result, our sole focus will be in the energy drink category and our business will become more vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the energy drink category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock. the failure to transition the distribution of our products to tccc distribution network in a timely manner could reduce and/or delay the expected benefits of the tccc transaction. if the expected transition of the u.s. distribution rights to tccc distribution network described above is not completed in a full, timely and/or efficient manner, the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements could be reduced and/or delayed. in this regard, we have been informed that approximately 64 ab distributors are challenging our right to terminate their distribution agreements in accordance with the express terms of such distribution agreements. we have filed separate arbitration demands against each of these parties seeking declarations of our rights, including our right to terminate the applicable distribution agreements in accordance with their terms. we have also filed an action in the united states district court, central district of california, against these parties to enforce each of their respective obligations to arbitrate any disputes arising under such distribution agreements. we believe the independent distributors allegations are without merit. 21 table of contents we expect to incur costs associated with transition of distribution which we currently estimate at $280.0 million. the final amount of those costs could be different and such differences could be material. in addition, under the tccc transaction agreements, up to $625.0 million of the net $2.15 billion cash payment to be paid to us by tccc will be held in escrow, subject to release upon achievement of milestones relating to the transition of distribution rights to tccc distribution network. a failure to meet those milestones would result in a decrease in, and/or delay of, the cash payment. following the tccc transaction, tccc will be a significant shareholder of newco and may have interests that are different from newco other shareholders (including current shareholders of the company). in connection with the tccc transaction, each outstanding share of the company common stock will be converted into one share of newco common stock. immediately following the consummation of the tccc transaction, tccc will own newco common shares representing approximately 16.7% of the total number of newco outstanding common shares. tccc will also have the right to nominate two directors to the newco board of directors, subject to reduction in certain circumstances. following the completion of the tccc transaction, tccc ownership could also have an effect on newco ability to engage in a change in control transaction. tccc will be obligated for a period of time to vote all of its newco common shares in excess of 20% of the outstanding newco common shares in the same proportion as all newco common shares not owned by tccc with respect to a proposal for a newco change of control. however, if tccc were to oppose such a change in control transaction, a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders of 62.5% of newco common shares not owned by tccc (assuming that tccc increased its ownership from approximately 16.7% to 20% of newco common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of newco outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. in addition, assuming the completion of the tccc transaction, tccc would have a bidding advantage if the newco board of directors were to seek to sell newco in the future because tccc would not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time, including the shares it acquires in the tccc transaction. tccc and newco would also be permitted to terminate tccc distribution coordination agreements with newco after a change in control of newco. in such event, tccc would receive a termination fee if tccc terminated the distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of newco involving certain tccc competitors, or if newco terminated following a change in control of newco, involving any third party. the interests of tccc may be different from or conflict with the interests of newco other shareholders (including current shareholders of the company, who will receive newco common shares in the tccc transaction) and, as a result, tccc influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential actions or transactions, including a potential change of management or control of newco, even if such action or transaction may be beneficial to newco other shareholders. moreover, tccc ownership of a significant amount of newco outstanding common shares could result in downward pressure on the trading price of newco common shares if tccc were to sell a large portion of its shares or as a result of the perception that such a sale might occur. the tccc transaction may not be completed or may be delayed, and even if the tccc transaction is successfully completed, the anticipated benefits to the company stockholders may not be realized. the completion of the tccc transaction is subject to certain customary conditions. the company or tccc may be unable to satisfy the conditions required to complete the transaction, and there is no assurance that the tccc transaction will be completed on a timely basis or at all. if the tccc transaction is not completed, we will nonetheless bear significant transaction costs. in addition, the current market price of our stock may reflect an assumption that the tccc transaction will occur, and failure to complete the tccc transaction could result in a decline in our stock price. the failure of the tccc transaction to be completed may also result in negative publicity and/or a negative impression of the company in the investment community and may affect our relationship with customers and other partners. 22 table of contents changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the u.s. federal, state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size, or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. for a discussion of certain of such legislation, see part i, item 1 business government regulation. furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the united states and other countries at the federal, state, local and municipal level in respect of each of the foregoing subject areas. public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as the disease affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. there also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages. to the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are sold individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for or availability of our energy drinks and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are also currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the ffdc act, including as amended by the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. outside the united states, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we cannot predict the effect of inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general and/or other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products. we are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks. in july 2012, we received a subpoena from a state attorney general in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our monster energy brand energy drinks. we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what, if any, effect it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 23 table of contents litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products. in 2012, we were named as a defendant in a product liability lawsuit, which alleged that the consumption of two 24-ounce cans of monster energy over the course of two days, caused the wrongful death of a fourteen year old girl (anais fournier) in december 2011. we do not believe that our products are responsible for the death of ms. fournier and intend to continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit. in addition, additional product liability lawsuits have since been filed against us, containing similar allegations to those presented in the fournier lawsuit, each of which we believe is also without merit and would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in the event any damages were awarded. in october 2012, we received a written request for information from the city attorney for the city and county of san francisco (the city attorney ) concerning our advertising and marketing of our monster energy brand of energy drinks and specifically concerning the safety of our products for consumption by adolescents. in a subsequent letter, the city attorney threatened to bring suit against us if we did not agree to take certain steps immediately and, on may 6, 2013, the city attorney filed a complaint against us for declaratory and injunctive relief, civil penalties and restitution for an alleged violation of california unfair competition law. we deny that we have violated the unfair competition law or any other law and believe that the city attorney claims and demands are preempted and unconstitutional. we intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. at this time, no evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or range of potential loss can be expressed. several other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading in nature and/or that our products are not safe. putative class action lawsuits have also recently been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their advertisements amount to false advertising. we do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or that our products are in any way unsafe and intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits. any of the foregoing matters or other product-related litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation, could consume significant financial and managerial resources, and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards against us and injury to our reputation. criticism of our energy drink products, and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally, could adversely affect us. an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content in our products or energy drinks generally, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and/or indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published in recent years. we believe the overall growth of the energy drink market in the u.s. may have been negatively impacted by the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine) and/or the levels thereof and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. if reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, they could adversely affect the demand for our products. 24 table of contents increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning as well as promotion and marketing strategies. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in some cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh, the dps group, kraft foods inc., suntory holdings, ltd., nestle beverage company, tree top and ocean spray. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. global economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. there can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. in addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets, or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the united states has increased our exposure to any developments or crisis in european and other international markets. if economic conditions deteriorate, our industry, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. there is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. recently, concerns have emerged regarding diet sodas and in particular, aspartame, which we do not use in our beverages. consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we may also be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 25 table of contents operations outside the united states expose us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 23%, 23% and 22% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business. if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some areas we have no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the u.s. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. such events could impact the production and distribution of our products. in addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. if we are unable to grow our business internationally as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we enter into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. we have not used instruments to hedge against all foreign currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. 26 table of contents we derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results. a substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our monster energy brand energy drinks. our dsd segment, which is comprised primarily of energy drinks, represented 96.1% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the energy shot category. domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, full throttle, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, nos, venom, redline, red devil, xenergy, mio energy, rip it, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee, rockstar roasted, 5-hour energy shots, stacker 2, vpx redline energy shots and many other brands. a number of companies who market and distribute iced teas, juice cocktails and enhanced waters in different packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass and plastic bottles, including sobe, sobe life water, snapple, arizona, fuse, ocean spray, honest tea, gold peak tea, activate, neuro and vitamin water, have added dietary ingredients to their products with a view to marketing their products as functional or energy beverages or as having functional benefits. in addition, certain large companies such as tccc and pepsico, market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as pepsi max, mountain dew, mountain dew mdx, mountain dew kickstart and vault. internationally, our energy drinks compete with red bull, rockstar, burn, v-energy, lucozade, adrenaline rush, relentless and numerous local and private label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as play, power play, mother, hell, shock, tiger, boost, speed, tnt, shark, hot 6, shark energy, nalu, battery, bullit, flash up, black, non-stop, bomba, semtex, vive 100, dark dog, speed, guaran , ultra, sting and a host of other international brands. our java monster product line competes directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, seattle best and illy issimo coffee drinks. our muscle monster product line competes directly with muscle milk, core power, abb pure pro and gatorade recover protein shake. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues and/or we could experience price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. we do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. in the event of a disruption and/or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including our monster energy brand energy drinks, our peace tea product line, our hansen brand energy drinks, our aseptic juice products, our hubert lemonades, our muscle monster product line, our java monster product line and certain of our other products. while we believe a short-term disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenue, a lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any of such products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products because alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our dsd segment products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including energy drinks. in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. 27 table of contents the tccc north american bottlers, new cce, coca-cola hellenic and the ab distributors are our primary domestic and international distributors of our monster energy products. however, in february 2015, in accordance with its existing agreements with the applicable third-party distributors, the company sent notices of termination to the majority of the ab distributors in the u.s. for the termination of their respective distribution agreements, to be effective at various dates beginning in march 2015. the associated distribution rights will be transitioned to tccc network of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottling and distribution partners as of the effective date of termination of the ab distributors rights in the applicable territories (see note 8 distribution agreements in the notes to consolidated financial statements). as a result, if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers and/or new cce and/or coca-cola hellenic, or if the tccc north american bottlers and/or new cce and/or coca-cola hellenic do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our monster energy products could be adversely affected. we continually seek to expand and/or improve the distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers and/or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our dsd segment brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. if we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of flavor ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. if we must replace a flavor supplier, we could experience a temporary disruption in our ability to deliver products to our customers and/or a reduction in demand for our products containing replacement flavors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our customers are material to our success. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. ccr accounted for approximately 29% of our net sales for both the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. a decision by ccr, ccrc, new cce, wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), coca-cola hellenic, or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. 28 table of contents increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, pet plastic bottles, as well as flavors, juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, dietary ingredients and other packaging materials; the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. in addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. we are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials although we do, from time to time, enter into purchase agreements for a significant portion of our annual anticipated requirements for certain raw materials such as aluminum cans, apple juice, sugar and sucralose. in addition, some of these raw materials, including certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, pet plastic bottles, glass bottles, labels, sucralose, flavors, dietary ingredients, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, protein, packaging materials or co-packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels and/or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if our customers or retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results could be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 29 table of contents our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in and to a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. however, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to maintain our brand image or product quality, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. there can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preference and demand. product quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media, internet or elsewhere, studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries, in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors, as well as proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer and we may incur material losses. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise materially not compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. climate change may negatively affect our business. there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates and dietary ingredients used in our products. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could 30 table of contents also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for juice concentrates, natural flavors and dietary ingredients or impact demand for our products. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. we do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. we may be unable to achieve analysts net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. there can be no assurance that we will achieve any projected levels or mixes of product sales and/or revenues and/or gross margins and/or operating profits and/or net income. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2014, our stock price high was $113.50 and our stock price low was $63.00. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 17, 2015, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 12% of our outstanding common stock. consequently, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. 31 table of contents our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals. although we currently have sufficient cash to support our planned operating activities in the current year, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities in the future. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our debtors and/or creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2014, we had $370.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $781.1 million in short-term investments and $42.9 million of long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. these risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to do so, our business, results of operations, financial condition or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. litigation, legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in part i, item 3 legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. defending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. we must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems. information technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including cybersecurity attacks. cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. however, 32 table of contents given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. moreover, if our data management systems, including our sap enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for pet plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream and protein, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 23% of consolidated gross sales for both the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. all foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of december 31, 2014 have terms of one month or less. we do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. we have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under asc 815. therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in interest and other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2014 to be significant. as of december 31, 2014, we had $370.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $824.1 million in short-term and long-term investments including u.s. treasuries, certificates of deposit and municipal securities which may have an auction reset feature. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. at the current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities.risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. following the tccc transaction, the company and tccc have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, the company future performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with tccc. in connection with the tccc transaction, the amended distribution coordination agreements entered into with tccc provided for the transition of third parties rights to distribute the company products in most territories in the u.s. to members of tccc distribution network, which consists of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottlers/distributors. on february 9, 2015, in accordance with its existing agreements with the applicable third-party distributors, the company sent notices of termination to certain affected third-party distributors, including the majority of the ab distributors in the u.s., providing for the termination of their respective distribution agreements, to be effective at various dates beginning in march 2015. the associated distribution rights were transferred to tccc distribution network in each applicable territory as of the effective date of the termination of the applicable third party rights in such territory. in addition, it is expected that tccc will become our preferred distribution partner globally. as a result, we will be reducing our distributor diversification and will be substantially dependent on tccc international distribution platform. also in connection with the tccc transaction, tccc made a substantial equity investment in the company and has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete in the energy drink category. while we believe that this will incentivize tccc to take steps to assure that our products receive the appropriate attention in the tccc distribution system, there can be no assurance of this as tccc is a much larger company with many strategic priorities. in addition, tccc does not control all members of its distribution system, many of which are independent companies that make their own business decisions that may not always align with tccc interests. moreover, it is also possible that we may fail to recognize the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements regardless of tccc priorities or the priorities of the members of tccc distribution system. in any such case, our operating results could suffer and the value of the company common shares could be adversely affected. following the tccc transaction, the company no longer competes with tccc in the non-energy drink category. as a result, we now derive virtually all of our revenues from energy drinks, and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results. under the terms of the tccc transaction, we have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete with tccc in the non-energy drink category. as a result, our sole focus is in the energy drink category and our business has become more vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the energy drink category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock. following the tccc transaction, virtually all of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our monster energy brand energy drinks. our monster energy brand energy drinks represented 92.5% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2015. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the energy shot category. domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, venom, redline, xenergy, mio energy, rip it, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee, rockstar roasted, 5-hour energy shots, stacker 2, vpx redline energy shots and many other brands. in addition, certain large companies such as pepsico market and/or distribute products in that market segment, such as pepsi max, mountain dew, mountain dew mdx and mountain dew kickstart. internationally, our energy drinks compete with red bull, rockstar, v-energy, lucozade, adrenaline rush and numerous local and private label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as hell, shock, tiger, boost, speed, tnt, shark, hot 6, shark energy, battery, bullit, flash up, black, non-stop, bomba, semtex, vive 100, dark dog, speed, guaran , sting, m-150, lipovitan, bacchus, bolt, mr. big and a host of other international brands. our java monster product line competes directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, seattle best and illy issimo coffee drinks. our muscle monster product line competes directly with muscle milk, core power, abb pure pro and gatorade recover protein shake. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues and/or we could experience price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 20 table of contents following the tccc transaction, in certain markets the company owns multiple potentially competing brands in the energy drink category. as a result of the tccc transaction, in certain markets we have acquired additional brands in the energy drink category. we may encounter difficulties managing different and potentially competing brands in such shared markets, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock. tccc is a significant shareholder of the company and may have interests that are different from the company other shareholders (including current shareholders of the company). immediately following the consummation of the tccc transaction, tccc owned common shares of the company representing approximately 16.7% of the total number of the company outstanding common shares. tccc also nominated two directors to the company board of directors. the number of directors that tccc is entitled to nominate is subject to reduction in certain circumstances. tccc ownership could also have an effect on the company ability to engage in a change in control transaction. tccc is obligated for a period of time to vote all of its common shares of the company in excess of 20% of the outstanding common shares in the same proportion as all common shares not owned by tccc with respect to a proposal for a change of control. however, if tccc were to oppose such a change in control transaction, a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders of 62.5% of the company common shares not owned by tccc (assuming that tccc increased its ownership from approximately 16.7% to 20% of the company common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of the company outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. in addition, tccc would have a bidding advantage if the company board of directors were to seek to sell the company in the future because tccc would not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time. tccc and the company would also be permitted to terminate tccc distribution coordination agreements with the company after a change in control of the company. in such event, tccc would receive a termination fee if tccc terminated the distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of the company involving certain tccc competitors, or if the company terminated following a change in control of the company involving any third party. the interests of tccc may be different from or conflict with the interests of the company other shareholders and, as a result, tccc influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential actions or transactions, including a potential change of management or control of the company, even if such action or transaction may be beneficial to the company other shareholders. moreover, tccc ownership of a significant amount of the company outstanding common shares could result in downward pressure on the trading price of the company common shares if tccc were to sell a large portion of its shares or as a result of the perception that such a sale might occur. 21 table of contents changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the u.s. federal, state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size, or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. for a discussion of certain of such legislation, see part i, item 1 business government regulation. furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the united states and other countries at the federal, state, local and municipal level in respect of each of the foregoing subject areas. public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as the disease affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. there also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages. to the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are sold individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for or availability of our energy drinks and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are also currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the fd&amp;c act, including as amended by the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. outside the united states, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we cannot predict the effect of inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general and/or other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products. we are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks. in july 2012, we received a subpoena from a state attorney general in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our monster energy brand energy drinks. we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what, if any, effect it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 22 table of contents litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products. we have been named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which allege that consumption of our products has been responsible for wrongful deaths and/or injuries. we do not believe that our products are responsible for such wrongful deaths and/or injuries, and intend to vigorously defend each such lawsuit. we believe that each of these lawsuits is without merit and would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in the event any damages were awarded. in october 2012, we received a written request for information from the city attorney for the city and county of san francisco (the city attorney ) concerning our advertising and marketing of our monster energy brand of energy drinks and specifically concerning the safety of our products for consumption by adolescents. in a subsequent letter, the city attorney threatened to bring suit against us if we did not agree to take certain steps immediately and, on may 6, 2013, the city attorney filed a complaint against us for declaratory and injunctive relief, civil penalties and restitution for an alleged violation of california unfair competition law. we deny that we have violated the unfair competition law or any other law and believe that the city attorney claims and demands are preempted and unconstitutional. we intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. at this time, no evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or range of potential loss can be expressed. several other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading in nature and/or that our products are not safe. putative class action lawsuits have also recently been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their advertisements amount to false advertising. we do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or that our products are in any way unsafe and intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits. any of the foregoing matters or other product-related litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation, could consume significant financial and managerial resources, and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards against us and injury to our reputation. criticism of our energy drink products, and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally, could adversely affect us. an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content and/or any other ingredients in our products or energy drinks generally, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. articles critical of the caffeine content and/or other ingredients in energy drinks and/or articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published in recent years. we believe the overall growth of the energy drink market in the u.s. may have been negatively impacted by the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine) and/or the levels thereof and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. if reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, they could adversely affect the demand for our products. 23 table of contents increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning as well as promotion and marketing strategies. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in some cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh and the dps group. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. global economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. there can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. in addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets, or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the united states has increased our exposure to any developments or crisis in european and other international markets. if economic conditions deteriorate, our industry, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. there is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. recently, concerns have emerged regarding diet sodas and in particular, aspartame, which is contained in certain of our strategic brands energy drinks. consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we may also be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 24 table of contents operations outside the united states expose us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 23% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, and our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business. if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some areas we have no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the u.s. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. such events could impact the production and/or distribution of our products. in addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. if we are unable to grow our business internationally as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. w e may enter into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. we have not used instruments to hedge against all foreign currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. 25 table of contents we do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. in the event of a disruption and/or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including our monster energy brand energy drinks, our muscle monster product line, our java monster product line and certain of our other products. while we believe a short-term disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenue, a lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any of such products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products because alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. many of our bottlers/distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. unilateral decisions could be taken by our bottlers/distributors, convenience and gas chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers, to discontinue carrying certain or all of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. the tccc north american bottlers, cce and coca-cola hellenic are our primary domestic and international distributors of our products. as a result, if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers and/or cce and/or coca-cola hellenic, or if the tccc north american bottlers and/or cce and/or coca-cola hellenic do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our products could be adversely affected. tccc, through the tccc subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 42%, 29% and 29% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. a decision by ccr, ccbc, cce, wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), coca-cola hellenic, or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. if we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business. generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. consequently, we do not have the list of flavor ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. if we must replace a flavor supplier, we could experience a temporary disruption in our ability to deliver products to our customers and/or a reduction in demand for our products containing replacement flavors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 26 table of contents increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, aluminum cans with resealable ends, flavors, juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, dietary ingredients and other packaging materials; the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. in addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. we are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials although we do, from time to time, enter into purchase agreements for a significant portion of our annual anticipated requirements for certain raw materials such as aluminum cans, apple juice, sugar and sucralose. in addition, some of these raw materials, including certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with resealable ends, pet plastic bottles, glass bottles, labels, sucralose, flavors, dietary ingredients, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, protein, packaging materials or co-packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels and/or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if our customers or retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results could be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans, and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 27 table of contents our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in and to a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. however, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to maintain our brand image or product quality, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. there can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preference and demand. product quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media, internet or elsewhere, studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries, in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors, as well as proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer and we may incur material losses. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise materially not compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. material product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. climate change may negatively affect our business. there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates and dietary ingredients used in our products. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for juice concentrates, natural flavors and dietary ingredients or impact demand for our products. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 28 table of contents potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. we do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. we may be unable to achieve analysts net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. there can be no assurance that we will achieve any projected levels or mixes of product sales and/or revenues and/or gross margins and/or operating profits and/or net income. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2015, our stock price high was $160.50 and our stock price low was $106.77. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 4, 2016, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 10% of our outstanding common stock. immediately following the consummation of the tccc transaction, tccc owned approximately 16.7% of our common stock. consequently, mr. sacks, mr. schlosberg and tccc could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals. although we currently have sufficient cash to support our planned operating activities in the current year, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities in the future. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our debtors and/or creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. 29 table of contents our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2015, we had $2,175.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $744.6 million in short-term investments and $15.4 million of long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. these risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. under gaap, we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. any such charge would adversely impact our results of operations. as of december 31, 2015, our goodwill totaled approximately $1,279.7 million and our intangible assets totaled approximately $428.0 million. if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to do so, our business, results of operations, financial condition or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. litigation, legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in part i, item 3 legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. 30 table of contents defending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. we must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems. information technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including cybersecurity attacks. cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. moreover, if our data management systems, including our sap enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, as well as cane sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream and protein, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 23% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. all foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of december 31, 2015 have terms of one month or less. we do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. 63 table of contents we have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under asc 815. therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2015 to be significant. as of december 31, 2015, we had $2,175.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $760.0 million in short-term and long-term investments including u.s. treasuries, certificates of deposit and municipal securities which may have an auction reset feature. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. following the tccc transaction, the company and tccc have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, the company future performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with tccc. in connection with the tccc transaction and the accompanying amended distribution coordination agreements entered into with tccc, we have transitioned third parties rights to distribute the company products in most territories in the u.s. to members of tccc distribution network, which consists of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottlers/distributors. in addition, tccc has become our preferred distribution partner globally with members of tccc network distributing our products internationally in countries throughout, but not limited to, africa, asia, central and south america, europe, mexico and the middle east. as we continue our international expansion, tccc distribution network will continue its role as our preferred distribution partner globally. as a result, we will be reducing our distributor diversification and will be substantially dependent on tccc domestic and international distribution platforms. also in connection with the tccc transaction, tccc made a substantial equity investment in the company and has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete in the energy drink category. while we believe that this will incentivize tccc to take steps to assure that our products receive the appropriate attention in the tccc distribution system, there can be no assurance of this as tccc is a much larger company with many strategic priorities. in addition, tccc does not control all members of its distribution system, many of which are independent companies that make their own business decisions that may not always align with tccc interests. moreover, it is also possible that we may fail to recognize the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements regardless of tccc priorities or the priorities of the members of tccc distribution system. in any such case, our operating results could suffer and the value of the company common shares could be adversely affected. following the tccc transaction, the company no longer competes with tccc in the non-energy drink category. as a result, we now derive virtually all of our revenues from energy drinks, and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results. under the terms of the tccc transaction, we have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete with tccc in the non-energy drink category. as a result, our focus is in the energy drink category, and our business has become more vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the energy drink category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock. following the tccc transaction, virtually all of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including, in particular, our monster energy brand energy drinks. our monster energy brand energy drinks represented 90.1% of net sales for the year ended december 31, 2016. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the energy shot category. domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, no fear, amp, adrenaline rush, venom, vpx redline, xenergy, mio energy, rip it, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee, rockstar roasted, 5-hour energy shots, stacker 2, vpx redline energy shots and many other brands. 19 table of contents in addition, certain large companies, such as pepsico, market and/or distribute products in that market segment, such as pepsi max, mountain dew, mountain dew mdx and mountain dew kickstart. internationally, our energy drinks compete with red bull, rockstar, v-energy, lucozade, adrenaline rush and numerous local and private-label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as hell, shock, tiger, boost, speed, tnt, shark, hot 6, shark energy, dragon, score, sting, battery, bullit, flash up, black, non-stop, bomba, semtex, vive 100, dark dog, speed, guaran , m-150, lipovitan, bacchus, bolt, mr. big and a host of other international brands. our java monster product line competes directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, seattle best and illy issimo coffee drinks. our muscle monster product line competes directly with muscle milk, core power, abb pure pro and gatorade recover protein shake. in addition, our mutant super soda product line competes directly with mountain dew, mountain dew mdx and mountain dew kickstart. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues, cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. following the tccc transaction, in certain markets the company owns multiple potentially competing brands in the energy drink category. as a result of the tccc transaction, we have acquired additional brands in the energy drink category in certain markets. these brands comprise the strategic brands segment which represents 8.9% of consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2016. although we continue to integrate these brands with our broader energy drink portfolio, we may encounter difficulties managing different and potentially competing brands in such shared markets, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock. tccc is a significant shareholder of the company and may have interests that are different from the company other shareholders (including current shareholders of the company). as of february 10, 2017, tccc owned common shares of the company representing approximately 18.0% of the total number of the company outstanding common shares. tccc also nominated two directors to the company board of directors. the number of directors that tccc is entitled to nominate is subject to reduction in certain circumstances. tccc ownership could also have an effect on the company ability to engage in a change in control transaction. tccc is obligated for a period of time to vote all of its common shares of the company in excess of 20% of the outstanding common shares in the same proportion as all common shares not owned by tccc with respect to a proposal for a change of control. however, if tccc were to oppose such a change-in-control transaction, a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders of 62.5% of the company common shares not owned by tccc (assuming that tccc increased its ownership to 20% of the company common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of the company outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. in addition, tccc would have a bidding advantage if the company board of directors were to seek to sell the company in the future because tccc would not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time. tccc and the company would also be permitted to terminate tccc distribution coordination agreements with the company after a change in control of the company. in such event, tccc would receive a termination fee if tccc terminated the distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of the company involving certain tccc competitors, or if the company terminated following a change in control of the company involving any third-party. the interests of tccc may be different from or conflict with the interests of the company other shareholders and, as a result, tccc influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential actions or transactions, including a potential change of management or control of the company, even if such action or transaction may be beneficial to the company other shareholders. moreover, tccc ownership of a significant amount of the company outstanding common shares could result in downward pressure on the trading price of the company common shares if tccc were to sell a large portion of its shares (when permitted to sell) or as a result of the perception that such a sale might occur. 20 table of contents changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the u.s. federal, state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including, prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. for a discussion of certain of such legislation, see part i, item 1 business government regulation. furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the united states and other countries at the federal, state, local and municipal level in respect of each of the foregoing subject areas. public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. there also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages. to the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are sold individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for, or availability of, our energy drinks, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are also currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the fd&amp;c act, as amended by the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; california proposition 65; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. outside the united states, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled, reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we cannot predict the effect of inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general, other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the production, advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products. we are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks. in july 2012, we received a subpoena from a state attorney general in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our monster energy brand energy drinks. we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what, if any, effect it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. from time to time, government and/or quasi-governmental agencies may investigate the safety of caffeine and energy drinks. for instance, in january 2013, the fda announced that it would be investigating the safety of caffeine in food products, particularly its effects on children and adolescents. 21 table of contents also in january 2013, we received a letter from representative edward j. markey, senator richard j. durbin and senator richard blumenthal requesting information from us to enable them to better understand a number of issues relating, in part, to an investigation they said had been launched by the fda examining energy drinks and potential health risks, particularly for groups of vulnerable individuals, including young people and those with pre-existing cardiac conditions. we provided a response to their letter. the congressmen issued a report and recommendations in april 2013, most of which we had already implemented. the congressmen released a follow-up report in january 2015, recommending, inter alia, that the energy drink industry not market to consumers under the age of 18 and not market their products for hydration, and that the fda develop and release definitions and guidance for this market sector. in addition, other organizations, such as the european food safety authority, have also published reports, studies, articles and opinions on caffeine and energy drinks. litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products. we have been named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which allege that consumption of our products has been responsible for wrongful deaths and/or injuries. we do not believe that our products are responsible for such wrongful deaths and/or injuries, and intend to vigorously defend any such lawsuits. we believe that each of these lawsuits is without merit and would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in the event any damages were to be awarded. in july 2012, the company received a subpoena from the attorney general for the state of new york in connection with its investigation concerning the company advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of its monster energy brand energy drinks. production of documents pursuant to that subpoena was completed in approximately may 2014. on august 6, 2014, the attorney general for the state of new york issued a second subpoena seeking additional documents and the deposition of a company employee. on september 8, 2014, the company moved to quash the second subpoena in the supreme court, new york county. the motion was fully briefed and was argued on march 17, 2015. on january 13, 2017, the court issued an opinion in which it agreed with certain company arguments regarding the scope of the subpoena and the attorney general investigation, but denied the motion to quash and granted the attorney general cross-motion to compel compliance. it is unknown what, if any, action the state attorney general may take against the company, the relief which may be sought in the event of any such proceeding or whether such proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the company business, financial condition or results of operations. several other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading in nature and/or that our products are not safe. putative class action lawsuits have also recently been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their advertisements amount to false advertising. we do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or that our products are in any way unsafe and intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits. any of the foregoing matters or other product-related litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation could consume significant financial and managerial resources and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards against us and injury to our reputation. 22 table of contents criticism of our energy drink products and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally, could adversely affect us. an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content and/or any other ingredients in our products or energy drinks generally, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. articles critical of the caffeine content and/or other ingredients in energy drinks and/or articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published in recent years. we believe the overall growth of the energy drink market in the u.s. may have been negatively impacted by the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine), and/or the levels thereof, and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. if reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, they could adversely affect the demand for our products. increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning as well as promotion and marketing strategies. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in some cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh and the dps group. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. our products also compete with private-label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores. due to competition in the beverage industry, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting edge products could adversely affect our business and financial results. our ability to compete in the highly competitive beverage industry and to achieve our business growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. the success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. if we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. global economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. there can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. in addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the united states has increased our exposure to any developments or crisis in african, asian, european and other international markets. if economic conditions deteriorate, our industry, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. there is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. recently, concerns have emerged regarding diet sodas and in particular, aspartame, which is contained in certain of our strategic brands energy drinks. 23 table of contents consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and price, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. product lifecycles for some beverage brands, products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we may also be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our continued expansion outside of the united states exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. we have continued expanding our operations internationally into a variety of new markets, including launches in china and various african and middle eastern countries. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 25%, 23% and 23% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some areas we have no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the united states. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. such events could impact the production and/or distribution of our products. in addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. if we are unable to grow our business internationally as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline. 24 table of contents fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. w e may enter into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. we have not used instruments to hedge against all foreign currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. foreign currency transaction losses were $9.7 million and $5.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. our acquisition of aff brought our primary flavor supplier in-house for the majority of our monster energy brand energy drinks. we also procure flavors from other flavor suppliers. we outsource manufacturing of our finished goods to bottlers and other contract packers. as a result, in the event of a disruption and/or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including our monster energy brand energy drinks, our muscle monster product line, our java monster product line and certain of our other products. for example, sales of our java monster and muscle monster product lines have been impacted by production capacity constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with certain of our co-packers. while we believe a short-term disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenue, a lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any of such products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products because alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates and/or costs and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. many of our bottlers/distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. unilateral decisions could be taken by our bottlers/distributors, convenience and gas chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers, to discontinue carrying certain or all of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic and coca-cola femsa are our primary domestic and international distributors of our products. as a result, if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic and/or coca-cola femsa, or if the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic and/or coca-cola femsa do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our products could be adversely affected. 25 table of contents tccc, through the tccc subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 41%, 43% and 29% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. a decision by the tccc subsidiaries, coca-cola european refreshments, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors, if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, pet plastic bottles, flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, dietary ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. in addition, certain of our co-packing arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. we are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, although we do, from time to time, enter into purchase agreements for a significant portion of our annual anticipated requirements for certain raw materials such as aluminum cans, apple juice, glucose, sugar and sucralose. in addition, some of these raw materials, including certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, pet plastic bottles, glass bottles, labels, sucralose, flavors, dietary ingredients, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, protein and packaging materials or experience difficulties with our co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, resulting in production fluctuations and/or shortages. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels, if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if our customers or retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results could be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships 26 table of contents with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time, and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in, and to, a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. however, there can be no assurance that other parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to maintain our brand image or product quality, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. there can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preference and demand. product quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof, (real or imagined), or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries, (in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer and we may incur material losses. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise materially non-compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. material product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. 27 table of contents if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. climate change may negatively affect our business. there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates and dietary ingredients used in our products. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain (including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for, juice concentrates, natural flavors and dietary ingredients) and/or impact demand for our products. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. potential changes in accounting standards or practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. fluctuations in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations . we are subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. therefore, we may be subjected to audits for multiple tax years in various jurisdictions at once. at any given time, events may occur which change our expectation about how the audit will be resolved and thus, there could be variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates because these events may change our plans for uncertain tax positions. future tax legislation, particularly within the u.s., may affect our effective tax rate. the current u.s. administration has indicated that tax reform is among its top priorities and the u.s. congress is currently reviewing and/or may in the future review tax legislation proposals. we do not know how such legislation, if enacted, will affect our business. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. we do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. we may be unable to achieve analysts net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. there can be no assurance that we will achieve any such projected levels or mixes of product sales, revenues, gross margins, operating profits and/or net income. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility, and stockholders may 28 table of contents not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016, our stock price high was $55.50 and our stock price low was $37.69. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 10, 2017, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 9.1% of our outstanding common stock. as of february 10, 2017, tccc owned approximately 18.0% of our common stock. consequently, mr. sacks, mr. schlosberg and tccc could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long-term goals. although we currently have sufficient cash to support our planned operating activities in the current year, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities in the future. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our debtors and/or creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2016, we had $377.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, $220.6 million in short-term investments and $2.4 million of long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. these risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. under gaap, we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, declining or slower than anticipated growth rates for certain of our existing products, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. any such charge would adversely impact our results of operations. as of december 31, 2016, our goodwill totaled approximately $1,331.6 million and our intangible assets totaled approximately $1,032.6 million. 29 table of contents if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in the company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls,and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to do so, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. litigation, legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in, part i, item 3 legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. defending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. we must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems. information technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including cybersecurity attacks. cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures including a cybersecurity risk assessment to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. moreover, if our data management systems, including our sap enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business (whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack and/or human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, as well as sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream and protein, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 25% and 23% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. all foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of december 31, 2016 have terms of one month or less. we do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. we have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under fasb asc 815. therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2016 to be significant. as of december 31, 2016, we had $377.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $222.9 million in short-term and long-term investments including u.s. treasuries, certificates of deposit and municipal securities which may have an auction reset feature. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. 64 table of contentsrisk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. the company and tccc have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, the company future performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with tccc. in connection with the tccc transaction and the accompanying amended distribution coordination agreements entered into with tccc, we have transitioned third parties rights to distribute the company products in most territories in the u.s. to members of tccc distribution network, which largely consists of independent bottlers/distributors. in addition, tccc has become our preferred distribution partner globally with members of tccc network distributing our products internationally in countries throughout, but not limited to, africa, asia, canada, central and south america, europe, mexico and the middle east. as we continue our international expansion, tccc distribution network will continue its role as our preferred distribution partner globally. as a result, we have reduced our distributor diversification and are now substantially dependent on tccc domestic and international distribution platforms. also in connection with the tccc transaction, tccc made a substantial equity investment in the company and has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete in the energy drink category in europe through june 2018 and in certain other territories through june 2020. while we believe that this will incentivize tccc to take steps to assure that our products receive the appropriate attention in the tccc distribution system, there can be no assurance of this as tccc is a much larger company with many strategic priorities. in addition, tccc does not control all members of its distribution system, many of which are independent companies that make their own business decisions that may not always align with tccc interests. moreover, it is also possible that we may fail to recognize the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements regardless of tccc priorities or the priorities of the members of tccc distribution system. in any such case, our operating results could suffer and the value of the company common shares could be adversely affected. we derive virtually all of our revenues from energy drinks, and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results. our focus is in the energy drink category, and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the energy drink category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock. virtually all of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including our monster energy brand energy drinks and our strategic brands acquired from tccc in 2015. our monster energy brand energy drinks and strategic brands represented 90.1% and 8.9% of net sales, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2017. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the energy shot category. domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, amp, venom, vpx redline, xenergy, mio energy, rip it, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee, rockstar roasted, 5-hour energy shots, stacker 2, vpx bang, v8+ energy, uptime, hi*ball and many other brands. in addition, certain large companies, such as pepsico, market and/or distribute products in that market segment, such as pepsi max, mountain dew and mountain dew kickstart. internationally, our energy drinks compete with red bull, rockstar, v-energy, lucozade and 19 table of contents numerous local and private-label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as hell, shock, tiger, boost, speed, tnt, shark, hot 6, shark energy, dragon, score, sting, battery, bullit, flash up, black, non-stop, bomba, semtex, vive 100, dark dog, speed, guaran , m-150, lipovitan, bacchus, bolt, mr. big, boom, raptor, amp, fusion, hi-tiger, eastroc super drink, carabao, powerhouse, xl, crazy tiger, effect, missile and a host of other international brands. our java monster and espresso monster tm product lines compete directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, dunkin donuts, gold peak tea, stok, high brew, hi*ball and international delight. our muscle monster product line competes directly with muscle milk, core power, premier protein, kellogg special k protein, bolthouse farms protein, eas advantedge, gatorade g series 03 recover, 5-hour, power bar and eas myoplex. in addition, our mutant super soda product line competes directly with mountain dew and mountain dew kickstart. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues, cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the company, in several markets, owns multiple potentially competing brands in the energy drink category. the strategic brands acquired from tccc in 2015 represented 8.9% of consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2017. in several markets our monster energy brand energy drinks and strategic brands compete with each other. although we continue to integrate the strategic brands with our broader energy drink portfolio, we may encounter difficulties managing different and potentially competing brands in such shared markets, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. tccc is a significant shareholder of the company and may have interests that are different from the company other shareholders (including current shareholders of the company). as of february 12, 2018, tccc owned common shares of the company representing approximately 18% of the total number of the company outstanding common shares. tccc has also nominated two directors to the company board of directors. the number of directors that tccc is entitled to nominate is subject to reduction in certain circumstances. tccc ownership could also have an effect on the company ability to engage in a change in control transaction. tccc is obligated for a period of time to vote all of its common shares of the company in excess of 20% of the outstanding common shares in the same proportion as all common shares not owned by tccc with respect to a proposal for a change of control. however, if tccc were to oppose such a change-in-control transaction, a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders of 62.5% of the company common shares not owned by tccc (assuming that tccc increased its ownership to 20% of the company common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of the company outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. in addition, tccc would have a bidding advantage if the company board of directors were to seek to sell the company in the future because tccc would not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time. tccc and the company would also be permitted to terminate tccc distribution coordination agreements with the company after a change in control of the company. in such event, tccc would receive a termination fee if tccc terminated the distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of the company involving certain tccc competitors, or if the company terminated following a change in control of the company involving any third-party. the interests of tccc may be different from or conflict with the interests of the company other shareholders and, as a result, tccc influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential actions or transactions, including a potential change of management or control of the company, even if such action or transaction may be beneficial to the company other shareholders. moreover, tccc ownership of a significant amount of the company outstanding common shares could result in downward pressure on the trading price of the company common shares if tccc were to sell a large portion of its shares (when permitted to sell) or as a result of the perception that such a sale might occur. 20 table of contents changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the u.s. federal, state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including, prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit the content of caffeine and other ingredients in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. for a discussion of certain of such legislation, see part i, item 1 business government regulation. furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the united states and other countries at the federal, state, local and municipal level in respect of each of the foregoing subject areas. public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. there also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages. to the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are sold individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for, or availability of, our energy drinks, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are also currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the fd&amp;c act; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; california proposition 65; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. outside the united states, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product, its label, or a production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled, reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we cannot predict the effect of inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general, other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the production, advertising, marketing, promotion, labeling, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products. we are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks. for example, in july 2012, we received a subpoena from the new york state attorney general in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our monster energy brand energy drinks. we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what, if any, effect it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 21 table of contents in addition, from time to time, government and/or quasi-governmental agencies may investigate the safety of caffeine and energy drinks. for example, in january 2013, the company received and responded to inquiries from u.s. legislators in response to fda investigation into the safety of caffeine in food products, particularly its effects on children and adolescents. these legislators ultimately released a report in january 2015, recommending, inter alia, that the energy drink industry not market to consumers under the age of 18 and not market their products for hydration, and that the fda develop and release definitions and guidance for this market sector. in addition, other organizations, such as the european food safety authority, have also published reports, studies, articles and opinions on caffeine and energy drinks. litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products. we have been and are currently named as a defendant in personal injury lawsuits which allege that consumption of our products has been responsible for wrongful deaths and/or injuries. we do not believe that our products are responsible for such wrongful deaths and/or injuries, and we intend to vigorously defend such lawsuits. in july 2012, we received a subpoena from the attorney general for the state of new york in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our monster energy brand energy drinks. on august 6, 2014, the attorney general for the state of new york issued a second subpoena seeking additional documents and the deposition of a company employee. we have complied with both subpoenas. we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what, if any, effect it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. several other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in compliance with food standards under local law, and/or that our products are not safe. putative class action lawsuits have also recently been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their advertisements amount to false advertising. we do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with local law, or that our products are in any way unsafe and we vigorously defend these lawsuits. any of the foregoing matters or other litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation could consume significant financial and managerial resources and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards against us and injury to our reputation. criticism of our energy drink products and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally, could adversely affect us. an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, such as those related to obesity, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content and/or any other ingredients in our products or energy drinks generally, including product safety concerns, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. articles critical of the caffeine content and/or other ingredients in energy drinks and/or articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published in recent years. we believe the overall growth of the energy drink market in the u.s. may have been negatively impacted by the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine), and/or the levels thereof, and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. in early 2018, certain retailers in the united kingdom announced the introduction of voluntary retailer measures to prevent the sale of energy drinks to individuals under the age of 16. if reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, or additional voluntary measures are taken, they could adversely affect the demand for our products. 22 table of contents increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning as well as promotion and marketing strategies. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in some cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh and the dps group. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. our products also compete with private-label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores. due to competition in the beverage industry, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting edge products could adversely affect our business and financial results. our ability to compete in the highly competitive beverage industry and to achieve our business growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. the success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. if we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. global economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. there can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. in addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the united states has increased our exposure to any developments or crisis in african, asian, european and other international markets. if economic conditions deteriorate, our industry, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. there is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. recently, concerns have emerged regarding diet sodas and in particular, aspartame, which is contained in certain of our strategic brands energy drinks. 23 table of contents consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and price, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. product lifecycles for some beverage brands, products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we may also be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our continued expansion outside of the united states exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. we have continued expanding our operations internationally into a variety of new markets, including launches in china and various african and middle eastern countries. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 28%, 25% and 23% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. as our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some areas we have no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the united states. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including; economic and/or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. such events could impact the production and/or distribution of our products. in addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. if we are unable to grow our business internationally as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline. 24 table of contents fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. w e may enter into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. we have not used instruments to hedge against all foreign currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. foreign currency transaction losses were $3.3 million, $9.7 million and $5.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. our acquisition of aff brought our primary flavor supplier in-house for the majority of our monster energy brand energy drinks. however, we also procure flavors from other independent flavor suppliers. we do not manufacture finished goods, but instead outsource manufacturing of our finished goods to bottlers and other contract packers. as a result, in the event of a disruption and/or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including our monster energy brand energy drinks, our muscle monster product line, our java monster product line, our espresso monster tm product line, our monster hydro product line and certain of our other products. for example, in the second half of 2016 and into the fourth quarter of 2017, sales of our java monster and muscle monster product lines were adversely impacted by production capacity constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with certain of our co-packers. while this short-term disruption in production did not significantly affect our revenues, a lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any our products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products because alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates and/or costs and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. many of our bottlers/distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. unilateral decisions could be taken by our bottlers/distributors, convenience and gas chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers, to discontinue carrying certain or all of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic and coca-cola femsa are our primary domestic and international distributors of our products. as a result, if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic and/or coca-cola femsa, or if the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic and/or coca-cola femsa do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our products could be adversely affected. 25 table of contents tccc, through the tccc subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 18%, 41% and 43% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. a decision by certain tccc north american bottlers (including ccbcc operations, llc), coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors, if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, pet plastic bottles, pet plastic cans, glass bottles, flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, dietary ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. in addition, certain of our co-packing arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. we are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, although we do, from time to time, enter into purchase agreements for a significant portion of our annual anticipated requirements for certain raw materials such as aluminum cans, glucose, sugar and sucralose. in addition, some of these raw materials, including certain sizes of cans, are available from limited suppliers. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, pet plastic bottles, pet plastic cans, glass bottles, labels, sucralose, flavors, dietary ingredients, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, protein and packaging materials or experience difficulties with our co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 26 table of contents if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels, if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if our customers or retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results could be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time, and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in, and to, a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. however, there can be no assurance that other parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to maintain our brand image or product quality, our business may suffer. our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. there can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preference and demand. product quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof, (real or imagined), or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries, (in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer and we may incur material losses. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise materially non-compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. material product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. 27 table of contents if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. climate change may negatively affect our business. there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates and dietary and other ingredients used in our products. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain (including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for, juice concentrates, natural flavors and dietary and other ingredients) and/or impact demand for our products. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our operations. potential changes in accounting standards or practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. fluctuations in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations . we are subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. therefore, we may be subjected to audits for multiple tax years in various jurisdictions at once. at any given time, events may occur which change our expectation about how any such tax audits will be resolved and thus, there could be variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates, because these events may change our plans for uncertain tax positions. on december 22, 2017, the president of the united states signed into law the tax and jobs act (the tax reform act ) which imposes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code. while we have provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the tax reform act in our financial statements, in particular as it relates to the reduction of our net deferred tax assets, actual amounts may vary materially from these estimates due to a number of uncertainties and factors, including further analysis and clarification of the tax reform act that cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 28 table of contents volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. we do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. we may be unable to achieve analysts net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. there can be no assurance that we will achieve any such projected levels or mixes of product sales, revenues, gross margins, operating profits and/or net income. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility, and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2017, the high of our stock price was $64.79 and the low was $41.02. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 12, 2018, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 9.3% of our outstanding common stock. as of february 12, 2018, tccc owned approximately 18.0% of our common stock. consequently, mr. sacks, mr. schlosberg and tccc could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long-term goals. although we currently have sufficient cash to support our planned operating activities in the current year, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities in the future. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our debtors and/or creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2017, we had $528.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, $672.9 million in short-term investments and $2.4 million of long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. these risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. under gaap, we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, declining or slower than anticipated growth rates for certain of our existing products, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, and slower growth rates in our industry. 29 table of contents we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. any such charge would adversely impact our results of operations. as of december 31, 2017, our goodwill totaled approximately $1,331.6 million and our intangible assets totaled approximately $1,034.1 million. if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in the company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to maintain such controls and procedures, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. litigation, legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in, part i, item 3 legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. defending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. we must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems, including, protecting us from internal and external cybersecurity threats. information technology enables us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. if we do not appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including internal and external cybersecurity threats. cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software (malware and virus), attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks, computer systems and data and other forms of electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in business systems, an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures including ongoing cybersecurity risk assessments to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. moreover, if our data management systems, including our sap enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business (whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack and/or human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. 30 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, as well as sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream and protein, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 28% and 25% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. all foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of december 31, 2017 have terms of one month or less. we do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. 63 table of contents we have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under fasb asc 815. therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2017 to be significant. as of december 31, 2017, we had $528.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $675.3 million in short-term and long-term investments including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, u.s. government agency securities, variable rate demand notes and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature). certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. the company and tccc have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, the company future performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with tccc. we have transitioned certain third parties rights to distribute the company products in most territories in the u.s. to members of tccc distribution network, which largely consists of independent bottlers/distributors. in addition, tccc has become our preferred distribution partner globally with members of tccc network distributing our products internationally, including in africa, asia, canada, central and south america, europe, mexico and the middle east. as we continue our international expansion, we expect tccc distribution network to continue as our preferred distribution partner globally. as a result, we have reduced our distributor diversification and are now substantially dependent on tccc domestic and international distribution platforms. 18 table of contents tccc has a substantial equity investment in the company. the company, tccc and certain affiliates are parties to various agreements in which tccc and certain affiliates have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete in the energy drink category in certain territories prior to the termination of the applicable distribution coordination agreement with tccc. the company distribution agreements with tccc distributors also provide, subject to certain exceptions, that the applicable distributor will not distribute competitive energy drink products. while we believe that these agreements incentivize tccc to take steps to ensure that our products receive the appropriate attention in the tccc distribution system, there can be no assurance of this as disagreements as to the interpretation of the provisions in such agreements may arise and tccc is a much larger company with many strategic priorities. in addition, tccc does not control all members of its distribution system, many of which are independent companies that make their own business decisions that may not always align with tccc interests. moreover, it is possible that we may fail to recognize the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements regardless of tccc priorities or the priorities of the members of tccc distribution system. in any such case, our operating results could suffer and the value of the company common shares could be adversely affected. on october 31, 2018, the company and tccc mutually agreed to submit an issue to the american arbitration association ( aaa ) in order to obtain clarification of an exception to a provision under various agreements preventing tccc from competing in the energy drink category. tccc has developed three energy products that it believes it may market under such exception, relating to the coca-cola brand. we expect a decision will be reached during the second quarter of 2019. in addition, tccc has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such products until april 2019. while we believe that the exception does not apply to this situation, there can be no assurances that the arbitration will resolve in our favor. as the relief sought is limited, no reasonable possible range of losses, if any, can be estimated. in addition, if tccc proceeds with the launch of such products, there can be no assurances that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the energy drink category in such territories, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. we derive virtually all of our revenues from energy drinks, and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results. our focus is in the energy drink category, and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the energy drink category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock. virtually all of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including our monster energy brand energy drinks and our strategic brand energy drinks acquired from tccc in 2015. our monster energy brand energy drinks and strategic brands represented 91.7% and 7.5% of net sales, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2018. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the energy shot category. domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, amp, venom, vpx redline, xenergy, mio energy, rip it, starbucks doubleshot, starbucks doubleshot energy plus coffee, rockstar roasted, 5-hour energy shots, stacker 2, vpx bang, v8+ energy, uptime, hi*ball, celsius, c4 and many other brands. in addition, certain large companies, such as pepsico, market and/or distribute products in that market segment, such as pepsi max, mountain dew and mountain dew kickstart. internationally, our energy drinks compete with red bull, rockstar, v-energy, lucozade and numerous local and private-label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as hell, shock, tiger, boost, speed, tnt, shark, hot 6, shark energy, dragon, score, sting, battery, bullit, flash up, black, non-stop, bomba, semtex, vive 100, dark dog, guaran , m-150, lipovitan, bacchus, volt, bolt, mr. big, boom, raptor, amp, fusion, hi-tiger, 19 table of contents eastroc super drink, carabao, power horse, xl, crazy tiger, effect, missile, nocco, adrenaline rush and a host of other international brands. our java monster , espresso monster and caff monster product lines compete directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks doubleshot, starbucks doubleshot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, dunkin donuts, gold peak tea, stok, high brew, mccaf , hi*ball and international delight. our muscle monster product line competes directly with muscle milk, core power, premier protein, kellogg special k protein, bolthouse farms protein, eas advantedge, eas myoplex, gatorade g series 03 recover, 5-hour and powerbar. our monster hydro product line competes directly with vitamin water, sparkling ice, bai, propel, vita coco, lucozade and bodyarmor. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues, cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the company, in several markets, owns multiple potentially competing brands in the energy drink category. the strategic brands acquired from tccc in 2015 represented 7.5% of consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2018. in several markets our monster energy brand energy drinks and strategic brands compete with each other. although we continue to integrate the strategic brands with our broader energy drink portfolio, we may encounter difficulties managing different and potentially competing brands in such shared markets, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. tccc is a significant shareholder of the company and may have interests that are different from the company other shareholders (including current shareholders of the company). as of february 20, 2019, tccc owned common shares of the company representing approximately 19% of the total number of the company outstanding common shares. tccc has also nominated two directors to the company board of directors. the number of directors that tccc is entitled to nominate is subject to reduction in certain circumstances. in march 2018, we entered into an agreement extending tccc right to nominate two directors to serve until june 2019. tccc ownership could also have an effect on the company ability to engage in a change in control transaction. tccc is obligated for a period of time to vote all of its common shares of the company in excess of 20% of the outstanding common shares in the same proportion as all common shares not owned by tccc with respect to a proposal for a change of control. however, if tccc were to oppose such a change-in-control transaction, a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders of 62.5% of the company common shares not owned by tccc (assuming that tccc increased its ownership to 20% of the company common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of the company outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. in addition, tccc would have a bidding advantage if the company board of directors were to seek to sell the company in the future because tccc would not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time. tccc and the company would also be permitted to terminate tccc distribution coordination agreements with the company after a change in control of the company. in such event, tccc would receive a termination fee if tccc terminated the distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of the company involving certain tccc competitors, or if the company terminated following a change in control of the company involving any third-party. the interests of tccc may be different from or conflict with the interests of the company other shareholders and, as a result, tccc influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential actions or transactions, including a potential change of management or control of the company, even if such action or transaction may be beneficial to the company other shareholders. moreover, tccc ownership of a significant amount of the company outstanding common shares could result in downward pressure on the trading price of the company common shares if tccc were to sell a large portion of its shares (when permitted to sell) or as a result of the perception that such a sale might occur. 20 table of contents changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the u.s. federal, state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including, prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit the content of caffeine and other ingredients in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. for a discussion of certain of such legislation, see part i, item 1 business government regulation. furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the united states and other countries at the federal, state, local and municipal level in respect of each of the foregoing subject areas. public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. there also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages. to the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are sold, individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for, or availability of, our energy drinks, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are also currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the fd&amp;c act; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; data privacy laws; california proposition 65; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. outside the united states, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product, its label, or a production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled, reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we cannot predict the effect of inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general, other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the production, advertising, marketing, promotion, labeling, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products. we are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks. if an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, from time to time, government and/or quasi-governmental agencies may investigate the safety of caffeine and energy drinks. for example, in january 2013, the company received and responded to inquiries from u.s. legislators in response to fda investigation into the safety of caffeine in food products, particularly its effects on children and adolescents. these legislators ultimately released a report in january 2015, recommending, inter alia, that the energy drink industry not market to consumers under the age of 18 and not market their products for hydration, and that the fda develop and release definitions and guidance for this market sector. in addition, other organizations, such as the european food safety authority, have also published reports, studies, articles and opinions on caffeine and energy drinks. 21 table of contents litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products. we have been and are currently named as a defendant in personal injury lawsuits which allege that consumption of our products has been responsible for wrongful deaths and/or injuries. we do not believe that our products are responsible for such wrongful deaths and/or injuries, and we intend to vigorously defend such lawsuits. several other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in compliance with food standards under local law, and/or that our products are not safe. putative class action lawsuits have also recently been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their advertisements amount to false advertising. we do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with local law, or that our products are in any way unsafe and we vigorously defend these lawsuits. any of the foregoing matters or other litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation could consume significant financial and managerial resources and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards against us and injury to our reputation. criticism of our energy drink products and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally, could adversely affect us. an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content and/or any other ingredients in our products or energy drinks generally, including product safety concerns, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. articles critical of the caffeine content and/or other ingredients in energy drinks and/or articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published in recent years. we believe the overall growth of the energy drink market in the u.s. may have been negatively impacted by the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine), and/or the levels thereof, and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. in early 2018, certain retailers in the united kingdom announced the introduction of voluntary retailer measures to prevent the sale of energy drinks to individuals under the age of 16. if reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, or additional voluntary measures are taken, they could adversely affect the demand for our products. increased competition could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning as well as promotion and marketing strategies. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. 22 table of contents important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in some cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh and kdp. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. our products also compete with private-label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores. the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. due to competition in the beverage industry, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting edge products could adversely affect our business and financial results. our ability to compete in the highly competitive beverage industry and to achieve our business growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. the success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. if we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. global economic uncertainties, including foreign currency exchange rates, affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. there can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. in addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the united states has increased our exposure to any developments or crises in african, asian, european and other international markets. unfavorable economic conditions and financial uncertainties in our major international markets, including uncertainties surrounding the united kingdom impending withdrawal from the european union, commonly referred to as brexit, and increases in tariffs that may result, and unstable political conditions, including civil unrest and governmental changes, in certain of our other international markets could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. there is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. recently, concerns have emerged regarding diet sodas and in particular, aspartame, which is contained in certain of our strategic brands energy drinks. consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and price, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. product lifecycles for some beverage brands, products and/or 23 table of contents packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we may also be unable to penetrate new markets. additionally, as shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with customers embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, we may be unable to address or anticipate changes in consumer shopping preferences. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our continued expansion outside of the united states exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. we have continued expanding our operations internationally into a variety of new markets, including launches in china and various african and middle eastern countries. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 31%, 28% and 25% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. as our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some areas we have no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the united states. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets; unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. such events could impact the production and/or distribution of our products. in addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. if we are unable to grow our business internationally as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline. 24 table of contents fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. w e may enter into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. we have not used instruments to hedge against all foreign currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. foreign currency transaction losses were $4.0 million, $3.3 million and $9.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses. as part of any hedging activities that we may conduct, we may enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. we also have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions both in the united states and abroad, exposing us to risk of default by or failure of such counterparty financial institutions. this risk of counterparty default or failure is greater during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty in financial markets. if one of our counterparties became insolvent or filed for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred due to the default or to retrieve assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty liquidity or applicable laws governing insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings. default by or failure of one or more of our counterparties could cause us to incur significant losses and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. our acquisition of aff in 2016 brought our primary flavor supplier in-house for the majority of our monster energy brand energy drinks. however, we also procure flavors from other independent flavor suppliers. we do not manufacture finished goods, but instead outsource manufacturing of our finished goods to bottlers and other contract packers. as a result, in the event of a disruption and/or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including certain of our monster energy brand energy drinks, our muscle monster product line, our java monster product line, our espresso monster product line, our monster hydro product line and certain of our other products. for example, in the second half of 2016 and into the fourth quarter of 2017, sales of our java monster and muscle monster product lines were adversely impacted by production capacity constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with certain of our co-packers. while this short-term disruption in production did not significantly affect our revenues, a lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any of our products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products because alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates and/or costs and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. in addition, recently there has been a consolidation of co-packers. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our largest co-packers, or if our costs of co-packing increase, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 25 table of contents we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. many of our bottlers/distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. unilateral decisions could be taken by our bottlers/distributors, convenience and gas chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying certain or all of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, coca-cola amatil, swire coca-cola (china), cofco coca-cola, coca-cola beverages africa and coca-cola ecek are our primary domestic and international distributors of our products. as a result, if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, coca-cola amatil, swire coca-cola (china), cofco coca-cola, coca-cola beverages africa and/or coca-cola ecek, or if the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, coca-cola amatil, swire coca-cola (china), cofco coca-cola, coca-cola beverages africa and/or coca-cola ecek do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our products could be adversely affected. tccc, through the tccc subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 3%, 18% and 41% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. a decision by certain tccc north american bottlers (including ccbcc operations, llc and reyes coca-cola bottling), coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, coca-cola amatil, swire coca-cola (china), cofco coca-cola, coca-cola beverages africa, coca-cola ecek, wal-mart, inc. (including sam club), or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors, if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers/distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, pet plastic bottles, glass bottles, caps, flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, coffee, tea, dietary ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. for certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers and used in a limited number of our monster energy brand energy drinks and/or our strategic brands energy drinks, these third-party flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. we do not have possession of the list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of our products and certain of our blended concentrates, and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. our third-party flavor suppliers generally do not make such flavors and/or blended concentrates available to other third party customers. we have identified alternative suppliers for certain of the ingredients contained in many of our beverages. however, industry-wide shortages of certain flavors, fruits and fruit juices, coffee, tea, dairy-based products, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been, and could from 26 table of contents time to time in the future be, encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. in addition, certain of our co-packing arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their fees based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. we are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. although we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, from time to time, we, through our aluminum can suppliers, enter into purchase agreements for the purchase of aluminum, as well as enter into purchase agreements for portions of our annual anticipated requirements for certain of our other raw materials such as glucose, sugar and sucralose. in 2018, the united states imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from china and certain other countries. additional tariffs imposed by the united states on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response, could result in an increase in supply chain costs. in addition, some of these raw materials, including certain sizes of cans, are available from limited suppliers. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, pet plastic bottles, glass bottles, caps, labels, sucralose, flavors, dietary ingredients, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, protein and packaging materials or experience difficulties with our co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels, if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if our customers or retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results could be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time, and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or 27 table of contents commodities for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in, and to, a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. however, there can be no assurance that other parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. negative publicity (whether or not warranted) concerning product safety or quality, human and workplace rights, obesity or other issues could damage our brand image and corporate reputation, and may cause our business to suffer. our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate reputation. there can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs and our commitment to product safety and quality and human rights will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preference and demand. product safety, quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof (real or imagined), or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries (in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. in addition, from time to time, there are public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business. these public policy debates can occasionally be the subject of backlash from advocacy groups that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. similarly, our sponsorship relationships could subject us to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support. likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our supply chain, with human and workplace rights issues could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. we have made a number of commitments to respect human rights, including through our human rights policy, supplier code of conduct, code of business conduct and ethics and our grievance procedures. allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting one or more of the 30 human rights found in the united nations universal declaration of human rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like could negatively affect our company overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products acceptance by consumers. 28 table of contents if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer and we may incur material losses. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise materially non-compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. material product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management, there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either rodney sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, hilton schlosberg, vice-chairman, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. climate change may negatively affect our business. there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates, and dietary and other ingredients used in our products and could impact the food security of communities around the world. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain (including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for, juice concentrates, natural flavors and dietary and other ingredients) and/or impact demand for our products. natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or floods, may affect our operations and the operation of our supply chain and unfavorably impact the demand for, or our consumers ability to purchase, our products. the predicted effects of climate change may also result in challenges regarding availability and quality of water, or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an effect on our operations, either positively or negatively. potential changes in accounting standards or practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales. 29 table of contents fluctuations in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations . we are subject to income and other taxes in both the u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. therefore, we may be subjected to audits for multiple tax years in various jurisdictions at once. at any given time, events may occur which change our expectation about how any such tax audits will be resolved and thus, there could be variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates, because these events may change our plans for uncertain tax positions. on december 22, 2017, the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax reform act ) which imposes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code. we completed our analysis of the tax reform act during 2018 and adjusted the 2017 provisional estimate to the final amounts in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no. 118. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. we do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. we may be unable to achieve analysts net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. there can be no assurance that we will achieve any such projected levels or mixes of product sales, revenues, gross margins, operating profits and/or net income. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility, and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018, the high of our stock price was $70.22 and the low was $47.61. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 20, 2019, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 9.8% of our outstanding common stock. as of february 20, 2019, tccc owned approximately 19% of our common stock. consequently, mr. sacks, mr. schlosberg and tccc could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long-term goals. although we currently have sufficient cash to support our planned operating activities in the current year, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities in the future. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our debtors and/or creditors could affect the financing of our future growth. 30 table of contents our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2018, we had $637.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $320.7 million in short-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasuries, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. these risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. under gaap, we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, declining or slower than anticipated growth rates for certain of our existing products, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. any such charge would adversely impact our results of operations. as of december 31, 2018, our goodwill totaled approximately $1.33 billion and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1.05 billion. if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in the company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to maintain such controls and procedures, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. litigation, legal proceedings, arbitrations, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, arbitrations, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in, part i, item 3 legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k. defending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. 31 table of contents we must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems, including, protecting us from internal and external cybersecurity threats. information technology enables us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. if we do not appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including internal and external cybersecurity threats. cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software (malware and virus), attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks, computer systems and data and other forms of electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in business systems, an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures including ongoing cybersecurity risk assessments to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. moreover, if our data management systems, including our sap enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business (whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack and/or human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, as well as sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream, protein, coffee and tea, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. 62 table of contents our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 31% and 28% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. all foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of december 31, 2018 have terms of three months or less. we do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. we have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under fasb asc 815. therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2018 to be significant. as of december 31, 2018, we had $637.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $320.7 million in short-term investments including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, u.s. government agency securities, u.s. treasuries, variable rate demand notes and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature). certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, including management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur or continue to occur, our business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results. the company and tccc have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, the company's future performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with tccc. we have transitioned all third parties' rights to distribute the company's products in the u.s. to members of tccc's distribution network, which largely consists of independent bottlers/distributors. in addition, tccc has become our preferred distribution partner globally with members of tccc's network distributing our products internationally, including in africa, asia, canada, central and south america, europe, mexico and the middle east. as we continue our international expansion, we expect tccc's distribution network to continue as our preferred distribution partner globally. as a result, we have reduced our distributor diversification and are now substantially dependent on tccc's domestic and international distribution platforms. tccc has a substantial equity investment in the company. the company, tccc and certain affiliates are parties to various agreements in which tccc and certain affiliates have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete in the energy drink category in certain territories prior to the termination of the applicable distribution coordination agreement with tccc. the company's distribution agreements with tccc distributors also provide, subject to certain exceptions, that the applicable distributor will not distribute competitive energy drink products. while we believe that these agreements incentivize tccc to take steps to ensure that our products receive the appropriate attention in the tccc distribution system, there can be no assurance of this as disagreements as to the interpretation of the provisions in such agreements may arise and tccc is a much larger company with many strategic priorities. in october 2018, the company and tccc mutually agreed to submit to arbitration before the american arbitration association the issue of whether tccc is permitted to manufacture, market, sell or distribute three energy drink products it developed. on june 28, 2019, the arbitration tribunal issued a final award in favor of tccc. tccc launched coca-cola energy in europe in 2019 and in the united states in 2020. as tccc proceeds to launch coca-cola energy in additional territories, we may encounter difficulties in maintaining distributor attention, market share or position in the energy drink category in such territories, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. in addition, tccc does not control all members of its distribution system, many of which are independent companies that make their own business decisions that may not always align with tccc's interests. moreover, it is possible that we may fail to recognize the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements regardless of tccc's priorities or the priorities of the members of tccc's distribution system. 18 table of contents we derive virtually all of our revenues from energy drinks, and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results. our focus is in the energy drink category, and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the energy drink category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock. virtually all of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including our monster energy brand energy drinks, our reign total body fuel tm energy drinks and our strategic brands energy drinks (including our affordable brand energy drinks, principally predator ). any decrease in the sales of our monster energy brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the energy shot category. domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, amp, venom, vpx redline, xenergy, xyience, mio energy, rip it, starbucks doubleshot, starbucks doubleshot energy plus coffee, starbucks tripleshot, costa coffee, nescafe, rockstar roasted, vpx bang, v8+ energy, uptime, hi*ball, celsius, c4, quake, adrenaline shoc, coca-cola energy, 5-hour energy shots, stacker 2, and many other brands. in addition, certain large companies, such as pepsico, market and/or distribute products in that market segment, such as pepsi max, gatorade bolt 24, mountain dew, mountain dew amp game fuel and mountain dew kickstart. internationally, our energy drinks compete with red bull (including non-carbonated red bull in china and asia), rockstar, v-energy, lucozade, coca-cola energy and numerous local and private-label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as hell, amper, shock, tiger, boost, speed, tnt, shark, hot 6, shark energy, dragon, score, sting, battery, bullit, flash up, black, non-stop, bomba, semtex, vive 100, dark dog, guarana, m-150, lipovitan, bacchus, volt, bolt, mr. big, boom, raptor, amp, fusion, hi-tiger, eastroc super drink, carabao, power horse, xl, crazy tiger, effect, missile, nocco, adrenaline rush, real gold, war horse, blu and a host of other international brands. our java monster , espresso monster and caff monster product lines compete directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks doubleshot, starbucks doubleshot energy plus coffee, starbucks tripleshot and other starbucks coffee drinks, costa coffee, nescafe, douwe egberts coffee, emmi caff , bang keto coffee, rockstar roasted, dunkin donuts, gold peak tea, stok, high brew, mccaf , hi*ball and international delight. our muscle monster product line competes directly with muscle milk, core power, premier protein, kellogg's special k protein, bolthouse farms protein, eas advantedge, eas myoplex, gatorade g series 03 recover and powerbar. our monster hydro and monster hydrosport super fuel product lines compete directly with vitamin water, sparkling ice, bai, propel, vita coco, lucozade, powerade, gatorade bolt 24 and bodyarmor. our reign total body fuel tm and reign inferno tm thermogenic fuel high performance energy drinks compete with vpx bang, adrenaline shoc, c4, quake, rockstar xdurance and celsius in the performance energy category. the increasing number of competitive products and limited amount of shelf space in retail stores may adversely impact our ability to gain or maintain our share of sales in the marketplace. in addition, certain actions of our competitors, including unsubstantiated and/or misleading claims, false advertising claims and tortious interference in our business, as well as competitors selling misbranded products, could impact our sales. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues, cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 19 table of contents the company, in several markets, owns multiple potentially competing brands in the energy drink category, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations in those markets. our various monster energy brand energy drinks compete with one another, and, in several markets, our monster energy brand energy drinks and strategic brands compete with each other. we may encounter difficulties managing different and potentially competing brands in such shared markets, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. tccc is a significant shareholder of the company and may have interests that are different from the company's other shareholders (including current shareholders of the company). as of february 20, 2020, tccc owned common shares of the company representing approximately 19% of the total number of the company's outstanding common shares. tccc has also nominated one director to the company's board of directors. tccc's ownership could also have an effect on the company's ability to engage in a change in control transaction. tccc is obligated for a period of time to vote all of its common shares of the company in excess of 20% of the outstanding common shares in the same proportion as all common shares not owned by tccc with respect to a proposal for a change of control. however, if tccc were to oppose such a change-in-control transaction, a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders of 62.5% of the company's common shares not owned by tccc (assuming that tccc increased its ownership to 20% of the company's common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of the company's outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. in addition, tccc would have a bidding advantage if the company's board of directors were to seek to sell the company in the future because tccc would not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time. tccc and the company would also be permitted to terminate tccc's distribution coordination agreements with the company after a change in control of the company. in such event, tccc would receive a termination fee if tccc terminated the distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of the company involving certain tccc competitors, or if the company terminated following a change in control of the company involving any third-party. the interests of tccc may be different from or conflict with the interests of the company's other shareholders and, as a result, tccc's influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential actions or transactions, including a potential change of management or control of the company, even if such action or transaction may be beneficial to the company's other shareholders. moreover, tccc's ownership of a significant amount of the company's outstanding common shares could result in downward pressure on the trading price of the company's common shares if tccc were to sell a large portion of its shares or as a result of the perception that such a sale might occur. changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the u.s. federal, state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including, prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit the content of caffeine and other ingredients in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. for a discussion of certain of such legislation, see part i, item 1 business government regulation. furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the united states and other countries at the federal, state, local and municipal level in respect of each of the foregoing subject areas. for instance, on january 1, 2020, a reform to a mexican excise tax went into effect that expanded the definition of an energy drink subject to this tax to include products with any amount of caffeine (the prior version of the tax required a threshold of 20 milligrams of caffeine per 100 millimeters for the tax to be applicable) and taurine or glucuronolactone or thiamine and/or any other substance that produces similar stimulating effects. public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the 20 table of contents public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. there also has been increased focus on caffeine content in beverages, and we are seeing some attention to other ingredients in energy drinks. to the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are sold, individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for, or availability of, our energy drinks, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are also currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the fd&amp;c act; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; data privacy laws; california proposition 65; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. outside the united states, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations. if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product, its label, or a production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or the products in question may have to be recalled, removed from the market, reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we cannot predict the effect of possible inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general, other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the production, advertising, marketing, promotion, labeling, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products. we are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks, and we are a party, from time to time, to various government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings. defending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management's time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. in addition, from time to time, government and/or quasi-governmental agencies may investigate the safety of caffeine and energy drinks. for example, in january 2013, the company received and responded to inquiries from u.s. legislators in response to fda's investigation into the safety of caffeine in food products, particularly its effects on children and adolescents. these legislators ultimately released a report in january 2015, recommending, inter alia, that the energy drink industry not market to consumers under the age of 18 and not market their products for hydration, and that the fda develop and release definitions and guidance for this market sector. in addition, other organizations, such as the european food safety authority, have also published reports, studies, articles and opinions on caffeine and energy drinks. if an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products, thus negatively affecting our financial results. we have been and are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. in particular, we have been and are currently named as a defendant in personal injury lawsuits which allege that consumption of our products has been responsible for wrongful deaths and/or injuries. we do not believe that our products are responsible for such wrongful deaths and/or injuries, and we intend to vigorously defend such lawsuits. 21 table of contents other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in compliance with food standards under local law, and/or that our products are not safe. putative class action lawsuits have also been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their advertisements amount to false advertising. we do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with local law, or that our products are in any way unsafe and we vigorously defend these lawsuits. any of the foregoing matters or other litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation could consume significant financial and managerial resources and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards against us, an injunction barring the sale of any of our products and injury to our reputation. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. criticism of our energy drink products and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally, could adversely affect us. an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content and/or any other ingredients in our products or energy drinks generally, including product safety concerns, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. articles critical of the caffeine content and/or other ingredients in energy drinks and/or articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published in recent years. we believe the overall growth of the energy drink market in the u.s. may have been negatively impacted by the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine), and/or the levels thereof, and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. in early 2018, certain retailers in the united kingdom announced the introduction of voluntary retailer measures to prevent the sale of energy drinks to individuals under the age of 16. if reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, or additional voluntary measures are taken, they could adversely affect the demand for our products. increased competition in the beverage industry and changing retail landscape could hurt our business. the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning as well as promotion and marketing strategies. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in some cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh and kdp. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. our products also compete with private-label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores. the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, and closures of physical retail operations, may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels and a reduction in impulse purchases. as we build our e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels. further, the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. 22 table of contents sales in gas chains may also be affected by improvements in fuel efficiency and increased consumer preferences for electric or alternative fuel-powered vehicles, which may result in fewer trips by consumers to gas stations and a corresponding reduction in purchases by consumers in convenience gas retailers. if we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. due to competition in the beverage industry, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting edge products could adversely affect our business and financial results. our ability to compete in the highly competitive beverage industry and to achieve our business growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. the success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. if we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. global economic uncertainties, including foreign currency exchange rates, affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. there can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. in addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the united states has increased our exposure to any developments or crises in african, asian, european and other international markets. unfavorable economic conditions and financial uncertainties in our major international markets and unstable political conditions, including civil unrest and governmental changes, in certain of our other international markets could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers' purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. included in the foregoing are uncertainties surrounding the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union on january 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as brexit ) and any resulting increases in tariffs, importation restrictions, out of stocks, volatility in currency exchange rates, including the valuation of the euro and the british pound in particular, changes in the laws and regulations applied in the united kingdom or impacts on economic and market conditions in the united kingdom, the european union and its member states and elsewhere. changes in consumer product and shopping preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. there is increasing awareness of and concern for health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients. some consumer advocacy groups and others have expressed concerns regarding certain ingredients in diet sodas, which are contained in certain of our energy drinks. this may reduce demand for our beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and price, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. product lifecycles for some beverage brands, products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers' preferences change. the beverages we currently 23 table of contents market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we may also be unable to penetrate new markets. additionally, as shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with customers embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, we may be unable to address or anticipate changes in consumer shopping preferences. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our continued expansion outside of the united states exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. we have continued expanding our operations internationally into a variety of new markets, including launches in china and various african and middle eastern countries. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 33%, 31% and 28% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. as our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some international markets we have no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the united states. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets; unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, tornados, earthquakes or floods, or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. such catastrophic events could impact our operations and our supply chain, including the production and/or distribution of our products. materials and/or personnel may need to mobilize to other locations. our headquarters and a large part of our operations are located in california, a state at greater risk of earthquakes and wildfires. some of the raw materials we use, including certain sizes of cans, are available from limited suppliers, and a regional catastrophic event impacting such suppliers could adversely impact our operations. in addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power and consumers' ability to purchase our products, thereby reducing demand for our products. if our operations are disrupted or we are unable to grow our business as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers, may be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus (or covid-19) outbreak. we and our suppliers currently globally source certain ingredients for our products from third-party manufacturers in wuhan (hubei province) and other parts of china, manufacture finished goods through third-party bottlers and co-packers 24 table of contents in china and have employees in china. the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus (or covid-19), and other adverse public health developments, could adversely affect our business and cause disruptions due to the closure or suspension of activities at such third-party manufacturers as well as at our co-packing facilities and our china office. certain aspects of our operations currently in china may need to be moved, even temporarily, to other locations. in addition, the outbreak, together with any accompanying special government measures, including general movement restrictions, travel restrictions and business closures imposed to slow its spread, could adversely impact the growth of our business in china and affect demand for our products, negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we may enter into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries' non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. we have not used instruments to hedge against all foreign currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. foreign currency transaction losses were $4.1 million, $4.0 million and $3.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses. as part of any hedging activities that we may conduct, we may enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. we also have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions both in the united states and abroad, exposing us to risk of default by or failure of such counterparty financial institutions. this risk of counterparty default or failure is greater during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty in financial markets. if one of our counterparties became insolvent or filed for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred due to the default or to retrieve assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or applicable laws governing insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings. default by or failure of one or more of our counterparties could cause us to incur significant losses and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. our acquisition of aff in 2016 brought our primary flavor supplier in-house for the majority of our monster energy brand energy drinks. however, we also procure flavors from other independent flavor suppliers. we do not manufacture finished goods, but instead outsource manufacturing of our finished goods to bottlers and other contract packers. as a result, in the event of a disruption and/or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including certain of our monster energy brand energy drinks, our muscle monster product line, our java monster product line, our espresso monster product line, our caff monster product line, our monster hydro product line and certain of our other products. for example, in recent years, sales of our java monster and muscle monster product lines were adversely impacted by production capacity constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with certain of our co-packers. while this disruption in production did not significantly affect our revenues, a lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any of our products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products, because alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate long- 25 table of contents term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates and/or costs and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. in addition, recently there has been a consolidation of co-packers. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our largest co-packers, or if our costs of co-packing increase, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer. many of our bottlers/distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). in many cases, such products compete directly with our products. unilateral decisions could be taken by our bottlers/distributors, convenience and gas chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying certain or all of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, coca-cola amatil, swire coca-cola (china), cofco coca-cola, coca-cola beverages africa and coca-cola ecek are our primary domestic and international distributors of our products. as a result, if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, coca-cola amatil, swire coca-cola (china), cofco coca-cola, coca-cola beverages africa and/or coca-cola ecek; or if the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, coca-cola amatil, swire coca-cola (china), cofco coca-cola, coca-cola beverages africa and/or coca-cola ecek; do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our products could be adversely affected. as tccc proceeds to launch coca-cola energy in additional territories, we may encounter difficulties in maintaining distributor attention, market share or position in the energy drink category in such territories, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. a decision by certain tccc north american bottlers (including coca-cola consolidated, inc. and reyes coca-cola bottling, llc), coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, coca-cola amatil, swire coca-cola (china), cofco coca-cola, coca-cola beverages africa, coca-cola ecek, wal-mart, inc. (including sam's club), or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors, if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers/distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business. the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, pet plastic bottles, caps, flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, coffee, tea, cocoa, supplement ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. for certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers and used in a limited number of our monster energy brand energy drinks and/or our strategic brands energy drinks, these third-party flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. we do not have possession of the list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of our products and certain of our blended concentrates, and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. our third-party flavor suppliers 26 table of contents generally do not make such flavors and/or blended concentrates available to other third-party customers. we have identified alternative suppliers for certain of the ingredients contained in many of our beverages. however, industry-wide shortages of certain flavors, fruits and fruit juices, coffee, tea, cocoa, dairy-based products, supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been, and could from time to time in the future be, encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. ingredient sourcing delays following the coronavirus (or covid-19) outbreak could also interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. in addition, certain of our co-packing arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their fees based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. we are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. although we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, from time to time, we, through our aluminum can suppliers, enter into purchase agreements for the purchase of aluminum, as well as enter into purchase agreements for portions of our annual anticipated requirements for certain of our other raw materials such as glucose, sugar and sucralose. in 2018, the united states imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from china and certain other countries. additional tariffs imposed by the united states on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response, could result in an increase in supply chain costs. our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. we may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, pet plastic bottles, caps, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplement ingredients, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, cocoa, protein and packaging materials or experience difficulties with our co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels, if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if our customers' or retailers' inventory levels are too high, our operating results could be adversely affected. if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time, and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers. many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans, pet plastic for bottles and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay 27 table of contents for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in, and to, a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. however, there can be no assurance that other parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. in 2019, vital pharmaceuticals, inc. ( vpx ) announced its intention to launch its own line of reign -branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. we filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction to stop this product launch and to prevent this infringement of our trademarks, and in january 2020 the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the injunction be granted in our favor. a number of proceedings are currently ongoing to adjudicate claims, including claims for false advertising and trademark infringement, brought by the company against vpx and by vpx against the company. certain proceedings could result in an injunction barring us from selling reign total body fuel branded energy drinks and/or require changes to be made to our current trade dress. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, or an injunction prevents us from selling any of our products, our business may be materially adversely affected. negative publicity (whether or not warranted) concerning product safety or quality, human and workplace rights, obesity or other issues could damage our brand image and corporate reputation, and may cause our business to suffer. our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate reputation. there can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs and our commitment to product safety and quality and human rights will have the desired impact on our products' brand image and on consumer preferences and demand. product safety, quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof (real or imagined), our environmental impact, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. consumer demand for our products could diminish significantly if we, our employees, bottlers/distributors, suppliers or business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, discriminatory, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of our customers, or the use of customer data. furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries (in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or any one of our brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company. business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us, our bottlers/distributors, suppliers or business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value or potentially trigger boycotts of our products and can have a negative impact on our reputation and financial results. the impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. in addition, from time to time, there are public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business. these public policy debates can occasionally be the subject of backlash from advocacy groups 28 table of contents that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. similarly, our sponsorship relationships could subject us to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support. likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our supply chain, with human and workplace rights or animal rights issues could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. we have made a number of commitments to respect human rights, including the policies and initiatives described in our california transparency in supply chains act &amp; united kingdom modern slavery act statement, available on our website at www.monsterbevcorp.com/sr-transparency.php . allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting one or more of the 30 human rights found in the united nations universal declaration of human rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like could negatively affect our company's overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products' acceptance by consumers. if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer and we may incur material losses. we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets, retailers or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise materially non-compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. a material product recall could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance. if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management, there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements. our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either rodney sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, hilton schlosberg, vice chairman, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. climate change may negatively affect our business. there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, and/or outbreaks of diseases or other health issues, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates, supplements and other ingredients used in our products and could impact the food security of communities around the world. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain (including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for, juice concentrates, natural flavors and other ingredients) and/or impact demand for our products. natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or floods, may affect our operations and the operation of our supply chain, impact the operations of our bottlers/distributors and unfavorably impact our consumers' ability to purchase our products. the predicted effects of climate change may also result in challenges regarding availability and quality of water, or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. we, our bottlers and our 29 table of contents contract packers use a number of key ingredients in the manufacture of our beverage products that are derived from agricultural commodities such as sugar, coffee, tea and cocoa. increased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns and other factors may limit the availability or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an effect on our operations, either positively or negatively. potential changes in accounting standards or practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products' affordability and reduce our sales. fluctuations in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations . we are subject to income and other taxes in both the u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. therefore, we are subject to audits for multiple tax years in various jurisdictions at once. we are in various stages of examination with certain states and certain foreign jurisdictions including the united kingdom and ireland. our 2016 through 2018 u.s. federal income tax returns are subject to examination by the irs. our state income tax returns are subject to examination for the 2014 through 2018 tax years. at any given time, events may occur which change our expectation about how any such tax audits will be resolved and thus, there could be significant variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates, because these events may change our plans for uncertain tax positions. additional changes in the u.s. tax regime or the manner in which u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. for example, the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting ( beps ) project. these changes, to the extent adopted, may increase tax uncertainty, result in higher compliance costs and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow. in connection with the oecd's beps project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries. economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. we do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. we may be unable to achieve analysts' net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin 30 table of contents and operating expenses. there can be no assurance that we will achieve any such projected levels or mix of product sales, revenues, gross margins, operating profits and/or net income. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility, and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019, the high of our stock price was $66.38 and the low was $47.84. provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders. our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 20, 2020, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 10.1% of our outstanding common stock. as of february 20, 2020, tccc owned approximately 19% of our common stock. consequently, mr. sacks, mr. schlosberg and tccc could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders. our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. at december 31, 2019, we had $798.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $546.0 million in short-term and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasuries, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, u.s. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. these risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. under gaap, we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, declining or slower than anticipated growth rates for certain of our existing products, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings during the period in which we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. any such charge would adversely impact our results of operations. as of december 31, 2019, our goodwill totaled approximately $1.33 billion and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1.05 billion. if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in the company could be materially and adversely affected. we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a controls and procedures. if we fail to maintain such controls and procedures, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. 31 table of contents we must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems, including protecting us from internal and external cybersecurity threats. information technology enables us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. if we do not appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including internal and external cybersecurity threats. cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software (malware, ransomware and viruses), phishing and social engineering, attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks, computer systems and data, malicious or negligent actions of employees (including misuse of information they are entitled to access) and other forms of electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in business systems, an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we rely on relationships with third parties, including suppliers, distributors, bottlers, contract packers, contractors, cloud data storage and other information technology service providers and other external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of our operations. these third-party service providers and partners, with whom we may share data, are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems, as well as employee failures. while we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. these third parties may experience cybersecurity incidents that may involve data we share with them or rely on them to provide to us. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures including ongoing cybersecurity risk assessments to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. moreover, if our data management systems, including our sap enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business (whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack and/or human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. if we fail to comply with data privacy and personal data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse publicity, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, which may negatively impact our business and operating results. we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to certain identified or identifiable individuals ( personal data ), including current and former employees, in the ordinary course of business. as a result, we are subject to various u.s. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal data. these laws are subject to change, and new personal data legislation may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any time. in the european union, the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) became effective in may 2018 for all member states. the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of residents of the european union different from those that were previously in place and also includes significant penalties for noncompliance. additionally, the california privacy act of 2018 ( ccpa ), which was enacted in june 2018 and came into effect on january 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action and statutory damages for certain data breaches and imposes operational requirements on companies that process personal data of california residents, including making new disclosures to consumers about data collection, processing and sharing practices and allowing consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. 32 table of contents changes introduced by the gdpr and the ccpa, as well as other changes to existing personal data protection laws and the introduction of such laws in other jurisdictions, subject the company to, among other things, additional costs and expenses and may require costly changes to our business practices and security systems, policies, procedures and practices. there can be no assurances that our security controls over personal data, training of personnel on data privacy and data security, vendor management processes, and the policies, procedures and practices we implement will prevent the improper processing or breaches of personal data. data breaches or improper processing, or breaches of personal data in violation of the gdpr, the ccpa and/or of other personal data protection or privacy laws and regulations, could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which may result in potential loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages or fines and/or criminal prosecution, thereby negatively impacting our business and operating results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. the principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of aluminum for cans, as well as sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream, protein, coffee and tea, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 33% and 31% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. during the year 62 table of contents ended december 31, 2019, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries' non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. all foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of december 31, 2019 have terms of three months or less. we do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. we have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under fasb asc 815. therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2019 to be significant. as of december 31, 2019, we had $798.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $546.0 million in short-term and long-term investments including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, u.s. government agency securities, u.s. treasuries, variable rate demand notes and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature). certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.
